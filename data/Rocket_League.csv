By 100-150 hours, you'll be flying around the map to score some crazy looking goals (in your opinion). But then, that's when the fun actually begins: mastering the basic moves of the game is basically mastering 1% of what you can do in this game. You'll end up playing more and more and more, until you realize you've just spent three hours in practice hitting the same shot again and again. Yes, this game is higly addictive. My favorite game ever without any doubts."
477,"4,323.6",Recommended," June 27, 2016",520,"Rocket League is less of a ""sports game"" and more of an actual sport. In FIFA or Madden you have a ""pass"" button, but to make a pass in Rocket League you have to drive your car into the ball at the right speed and angle to send it over to where your teammate is going. You have to create the pass yourself, and it can be anything, from a hard bounce off the back wall to a soft lob over the defender.Passing, shooting, dribbling, tackles, jukes, they're all in the game, but you have to make them happen yourself, not just press the right button. At first, just driving car to ball is a challenge, but as your skill grows, the freedom to create any play you can imagine and execute is unlike anything you'll find in a ""sports game"". Together with the mechanical skill to do what you want with the ball, you'll have to develop positional awareness and learn proper rotation and game sense.There are very few games that are consistently rewarding for hundreds or thousands of hours, that can keep challenging you as you improve, and improve, and improve beyond what you ever imagined you'd be capable of. In fact, this is the ONLY one I know.Best.Game.Ever."
2,325.3,Recommended," July 12, 2015",697,"Rocket League is a perfect game for short breaks. 5 minutes of flying and exploding cars, then I can continue doing whatever I was doing before. (To be honest, it usually ends up in ""one more match"" multiple times. That's how it's good.)The game is easy to learn and just fun to play. Making the perfect aerial shot, passing to a goal, saving the ball from reaching your goal at the last possible moment, failing hard and scoring an own goal... These are all moments you will see in Rocket League.Are you in a mood for tactical game? Play 2v2. Do you want chaos? Play 4v4.I love car customization.

Late into Pro level, you would have likely looked up advanced tips for Rocket League. Worst mistake of your life. You now know what aerials are. You think you can fly. The ball comes up high and you go for an aerial. Once you jump, you fly straight into the ground and continue to do frontflips until you land on your back... What the ♥♥♥♥ happened there? Oh. You're using keyboard. Yeah nah, time to get a controller,♥♥♥♥♥♥head.- You now have a controller and go for terribly unlikely aerials. You think you're good.

This game is now your life. You can also score off a wall every now and then. Good times.- You are now a god to every level lower than you. You have perfected the art of wall shots. You are an extremely cool person. A nice little bonus is that everyone under the level of Pro will now spam ""Sorry!"" every time they do something wrong to you.- The most badass-looking title you can have. ♥♥♥♥ Rocketeer. You probably now have an extreme case of false confidence. Once you get used to the badass title, you'll wreck anything and anyone with ease. You can also pull off freestyles consistently. Nice job! Also be sure to prepare for an endless stream of ""You're not good enough for Legend!""- You can now 720-freestyle-backflip-reverse-backwards-aerial-air dribble off a wall with ease. You probably boosted for that Rocketeer tag.

101,750.0,Recommended," July 9, 2015",118,"OK first of all its a shame that most negative reviews are based on first 2 days after release where the team of devs had some problems with the servers. They worked day an night and now everything is working fine at least for me.So, i played this game on Beta on PS4 and i was pretty hyped about the launch. It didn't disapoint. I have it for free on PS4 and bought it on steam to play with friends.The game is a ton of fun. The gameplay is easy to learn, hard to master.Graphics are pretty nice and cars come with a ton of costumization options (FOR FREE).We can face AI opponents with diferente skill levels (that can make a huge diference) or we can play vs players usually with simillar skill (sometimes u can face players really better than u but their in game rate is the same or lower than yours).There are several game modes but the only major difference is the amount of players and ranked match or not.Its great to play with friends. Hard to quit playing even if you're really tired.I seriously recomend using a controller. I use my DS4 with Bluetooth (using inputmapper) and it works perfectly. For ppl using other controllers i recomend x360ce (helped 2 friend who were using a ds2 and a sega saturn controller).A word also for the devs that seem to work night and day to fix problems. Keep up the good work.Great game. One of the better for sure to release this year."

861,157.8,Recommended," July 7, 2015",72,"To give you an idea of how good this game is - I currently have 511 games in my Steam library, and this is the only one I've gone out of my way to review.SARPBC (the PS3 predecessor to Rocket League) has been a favorite of my friends and I for... years. Literally years. We've put thousands of hours into it. It's one of those incredibly rare games that all of us are always keen to play because it's always fun.Rocket League, I'm happy to say, is SARPBC with improved graphics and gameplay, better accessibility for new players, plus a ton of added options that give the game an extra layer of character. It's going to comfortably replace SARPBC in my top five games, all-time, across all genres. It's also replacing SARPBC as my absolute favorite multiplayer game - online or local.+ Fun, deep, brilliantly fast-paced gameplay+ Games are long enough to mean something, but short enough that a loss is never too frustrating.+ Games are almost never over until the final buzzer. Results can turn on a dime - and when they do, it's always because a player or team has stepped up, rather than any fault of or flaw with the game itself.+ The learning curve is fairly smooth, but the skill ceiling is also incredibly high. Despite the aforementioned years playing SARPBC, I still see players in Rocket League pulling off moves that I can only dream of.+ There's massive flexibility in how you play, more than any other game I know of. Offline with bots. Offline split-screen. Online. Online split-screen. Online split-screen with bots. 1 v 1 if you don't feel like playing on a team, or 2 v 2 / 3 v 3 / 4 v 4 if you do. And the game is just as suited to mano-a-mano matches as it is to team play, which is (again) a very, very rare quality.- The one slightly disappointing thing I'll mention is (at launch) the lack of variety in maps. SARPBC had a bunch of quite inventive, distinctive maps that forced different play styles and tactics. Rocket League's maps are aesthetically different, but structurally uniform. Luckily, word is that some 'crazier' maps will likely be arriving in the forthcoming free DLC. I'm still thoroughly enjoying what's already there, but some extra variety in that regard will definitely be welcome.If the idea of fast-paced soccer (sans rules) with cars even vaguely appeals to you, get this game immediately. It's one I fully expect to still be playing - and thoroughly enjoying - years from now."
756,331.4,Recommended," July 30, 2015",375,"If you're even just slightly interested in arcade racing games and/or football, then you should check this out...well, actually, even if you're not ;)In Rocket League, you're playing football (or soccer) with cars, with the addition that you have a speed booster and you can jump, which can make for some great moves and aerial shots.You can choose from 1v1, 2v2, 3v3 or 4v4 Matches, so it's nowhere near as much players as in real football, but that's actually a good thing, even with 4v4 it can get pretty messy and chaotic...then again, that can be fun as well ^^It's rather easy to get into the game, as you have tutorial for the basics, like handling your booster, doing aerial shots, defense etc. But that doesn't mean there is no challenge. To do those insane aerial maneuvers, you'll need quite some training.The Main Motivation comes from being a competitive game, either via ranked games or normal matches against other players. There is also a single-player mode, but that's more for practicing and getting into the game than a selling point for the game.You can also unlock stuff for your car, like hats, booster color, tires and patterns to put onto your car.I've never been a big fan of either genre, yet Rocket League manages to pull me in and gets me excited about every match i play. Even if you're playing with random people, it's not that bad and you can have quite some fun, though having a good team which is working good together would be the most fun.So, hope to see some of you on the field :)"

You'll first join the tutorial and start touching the ball, yea it feels good we know. Then you decide you'll give online a go, REAllY see what this ♥♥♥♥♥ is about. You're first game online you get 2 clears and a center ball, pretty raunchy. You decide to tax yourself on another game and press rematch. You give a great pass to your team mate, wou lose 1-2. You continue to play online even though you have no idea what the ♥♥♥♥ you're doing but for some reason you can't stop playing it. Then you start to progress and get better and learn to manipulate the car and the ball in ways you've never seen, and fly(Did I mention you could ♥♥♥♥ing fly). You then start to forget about where you came from and whether or not you even liked the damn game to begin with. You slowly then being training every day before work or school, practicing aerials and dribbling in free play mode. The ball slowly becomes a part of you. You become the rank of ""Pro"" and you're feeling pretty damn hot right now♥♥♥♥♥♥ even scalding. You slowly climb the ranks and descend into the madness that is rocket league. Then the itch starts. You'll be at work or out running errands thinking about how much better time could be spent playing rocket league. When you see a subaru on the road, it's not a subaru to you anymore it's now a Takumi. When you go to bed you dream of Rocket League. Now we go back to the original question of whether or not you would like this game? You'll ♥♥♥♥ing love it, too much. The developers, Psyonix, are incredibly good at listening to what the community wants. Each update they continue to push out more and more content and the game is growing everyday. So many funny options to decorate and customize your cars, from toppers to antennas. You can unlock items in game and craft rarer, more exclusive items from those. You dont have to good at rocket league to like it, you just have to be better at having fun. I have made so many memories off this $20 purchase. Like how the hell are they only charging $20 for this game its incredible.

254,849.9,Recommended," May 15, 2016",144,"Rocket League is one of my favorite games. Why?The game's system is the best that i can imagine. Your advantage over other players isn't measured by how many hours you have, how many dlcs you got, or your level. It's measured by how much you've learned and perfected.You start as a derp car that can't hit a ball 20ft above the ground. Then you keep playing against people of the same skill, until you see someone who can do some cool/pro/funky/op stuff, then you see his goals and you think: ""Wow, look at that shot, i must learn how to do it!""Then in a matter of time, you learn how to do it and even do better. One step closer to become a Rocketeer.some more training and you can hit the ball wherever it is.even more and you can aim the ball wherever you want.The controls are great, comfortable and very easy to learn. If you use a controller, you will not have an advantage against who uses a keyboard and vice-versa.The graphics are nice, you can play it with a microwave using low graphics, or a medium computer on max graphics with a solid 60 fps. They could be better though (?)The levels normally represent your skill very well if you aren't a lot above-average or below-average, with a Rookie playing like a rookie and a legend playing like a legend. (The level ""Pro"" is just wrong, you probably aren't pro yet if you are there)The matchmaker does its job well. Rather than your level, it takes your ""skill"" in consideration, so you will often play with people only slightly better or worse than you. This isn't bad, it is actually very good for you to learn and get better.Can i say anything more?NO item in the game gives you advantage over other player, all cars have the same speed and the only thing that changes is the hitbox, not a big deal when you learn the controls. The DLCs don't make you better or anything, too."

835,152.6,Recommended," July 13, 2015",107,"Rocket League is a Football(Soccer) inspired sports game made by Psyonix. In this game you use a car to hit around a large ball into a goal, pretty much Football(Soccer) with cars. It might be the best game I've played this year so far.There are a few different game modes, including online, Exhibition where you play against bots or your friends in local play, and a season mode where you play as a member on a team and you try and complete a season and win the championship. The game modes are fun, but not very different from each other. I do wish the Season mode was more like a Franchise mode in something like Madden, being able to control all the little things of your team, and having more stat tracking would make it a lot better, but its still worth a play or two.The gameplay in this game is perfect. Once you figure out the flow to your car, how to use boosting properly, and how to track the ball, you'll realize just how addicing the game can be. Against bots or online, the game shines in its fun and addicting gameplay that adds a unique twist on the game of Football(Soccer). Learning the game comes quick, but mastering the techniques could easily take 30-50 hours of gameplay.You have a large selection of cars and different things you can design them with. The speed and hitboxes are pretty much the same, so there isn't an optimal car to use, which is a great thing. All the different customization is basically cosmetic that does some minor stat tracking. I'm really happy they went this route, because you don't feel obligated to build your car based on some kind of metagame, you can customize it however you like it.Besides the season mode being kind of lacking, the only other complaint I had(notice, had), was the online. The first day I had it I couldn't play online at all, it just didn't work, and apparently until Saturday the online was pretty much broken. Thankfully, its been pretty much fixed, but I thought it would be an important point to mention. It is good that the developers showed commitment and actually fixed the problem, though.Rocket League is an amazing game with addictive gameplay. I don't really get the people that say they don't like sports games, a lot of the gameplay and stat tracking in them is great, and this game is no exception. If your looking for a game to play with friends, or even by yourself that is very competitive based, or even if your just bored and looking for a game to risk $20 on, Give Rocket League a shot, its one of the best games to come out this year.Pros:-Strong gameplay-Easy to learn, hard to master-Plenty of car customization-No car building meta, you can customize without worry-Encoranges teamwork-Reasonable asking price($20)Cons:-Lacking season mode could use more stat tracking and player control"

60,267.5,Recommended," April 7, 2017",126,"Don't let my hours discourage you. I have been playing this game on PS4 since it's release date of July 2015. I've loved every second. (Well, maybe not EVERY second)Soccer with cars. I don't know how that concept works, but it does. Perfectly. Rocket League is the gold standard of a competitive sports game. It is super easy for anyone to just pick up a controller and play. The controls are simple, as well as the core gameplay. It's a great concept. Anybody can play it, but only when you take the time practicing to learn how to predict the ball, where to hit the ball to direct it, and how to fly is when the real game shines.The customization in Rocket League is wonderful. Upon just starting, you're given few cars, decals, wheels, etc. As you play, more customization options are randomly unlocked upon completing a match. The ways you can customize cars is endless, with no two cars looking the same. The customization has no effect on the stats of each car, each is purely cosmetic. On the topic of stats, the bodies of each car do have individual stats. Hitboxes, turn radius, and acceleration times all become a factor when choosing a car that suits you. Microtransactions do exist in this game in the form of Crates. Much like CS:GO, you purchase keys to open said crates, which contain items from common to Exotic. Items in crates tend to be much cooler looking than the items that are included in the vanilla game, with moving decals and electric wheels being two of the many highlights. Fortunately, everything in these crates are purely cosmetic, meaning there is no Pay-to-win factor in Rocket League. I actually find myself buying these keys more often than in other games. This is probably the only game in which I have no problem supporting the developers, because they are doing such an amazing job.Now, onward to the gameplay, the most unique aspect of Rocket League. At its core, each match consists of two teams trying to score more goals into the opponents net to win. However, with the addition of boost and the ability to drive on walls, the game becomes much more than that. Pressing the jump button while in the air will propel your car into any direction you are moving, allowing you to hit the ball with a little more force. This mechanic is great for putting the ball where you want it to go, with direct control of where your car is. The driving in this game feels smooth and crisp, with a handbrake allowing very tight turns. Boost allows you to accellerate at a much quicker speed, and put more power into your shot. The boost mechanic really comes into play when the boost is used to thrust your car off the ground, turning your car into a rocket ship with wheels. This results in some truly beautiful shots and rewards the players who take the time to practice this move. Seeing somebody fly so gracefully toward the ball, smacking it into the net is just something so great that isn't found in other games. For newcomers, even hitting the ball can give satisfaction, and a narrow miss can make your heart skip a beat. After countless hours of playtime, I still find myself tensing up before a big hit.Upon scoring, the ball explodes into the net, throwing any player close enough accross the pitch. This is very satisfying, and it accompanied with a replay of the goal in slow motion, allowing you to see all of the glory (or B.S., in some cases). Quick chats are available such as ""Nice Shot!"" and ""Wow!"", although expect to get slightly tilted as ""What a save!"" will be spammed if you miss a save.Teams in Rocket League can have up to 4 players, with game modes of 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, and 4v4. The 4v4 game mode is a little too chaotic for my liking (Which is probably why it is called 'chaos'). 2v2 and 3v3 are undoubtedly the best game modes, as this is where team play really shines. A pass to a teammate that leads to a goal (Even though it was probably not intentional) is a spectacular feeling, especially when shared with friends. There are also variations of these game modes, like Hoops, a basketball version of the game with hoops instead of goals. Snow Day, in which a hockey puck replaces the ball, and Rumble, where every 10 seconds you get a powerup ranging from a Glove to punch the ball and spikes that make the ball stick to your car. These game modes are fun from time to time, but I don't spend too much time playing them. The most recent addition, Dropshot, is undoubtedly the most fun game mode they have added. It consists of two teams of 3 and no goals. The objective is to smash the ball into the ground, causing the ground to take damage. Upon taking enough damage, the ground will open up, creating a goal for your team. Not only is this game mode fun as hell, it also serves as good practice for hitting those aerials.Rocket League is one of those rare games in which a competitive mode is implemented into the game. Competitive has 4 game modes: Duel (1v1), Doubles (2v2), Standard (3v3), and Solo Standard (3v3, however no parties are allowed). Included with these game modes are ranks to measure your skill. The ranks range range from Bronze to Platinum to Champion. Within each rank are 3 sub-categories. For example, within Gold there is Gold I, Gold II, and Gold III, with I being the lowest and III being the highest. Furthermore, within these categories are divisions. Divisions range from I-IV, with IV being the highest. If you were to start out as Gold I division II, winning a game would bring you to division III, and the opposite for a loss. Once you pass division IV, you move up in categorym making you Gold II. During Season 3 of competitive play I managed to make it up to Champion, although it took lots of time and lots of patience. It's so addictive, you'll have yourself saying 'just one more game' after each match.Also on the rise is the pro-league scene for Rocket League. We are about to enter the finals the the third season of the Rocket League Championship Series, with North America and Europe about to battle it out in the World Championships. Pro matches in Rocket League are unlike any other game. The teamwork and ball movement across the pitch are truly incredible. I highly recommend checking it out.Unfortunately, with all other competitive games, smurfs are an issue in Rocket League. It sucks, because you could be one win away from getting that new rank, and then a smurf comes and sets you back down a few divisions. Also, with the implementation of the new ranks in Competitive, there are many high level players being placed into really low ranks. This is not only unfair to the players who get ranked low, but to the people they play against. I'm hoping this issue gets fixed, but it seems to be a problem every time a new season begins.Updates to this game are very frequent. New content is delivered almost monthly, with new maps, cars, game modes, and crates. The development team knows how to handle a game and keep their community happy, which is refreshing to see. The game sees new content every few months. The developers are constantly adding things to the game, keeping it fresh for its players. Not enough credit can be given to Psyonix and their development with the game. Rocket League couldn't be in better hands.So, should you buy Rocket League? Absolutely. It is arguably the best game you can buy for under $20 right now. Rocket League is an extraordinary game. It's a game that I can constantly come back to, because it never gets repetitve. The mechanics are some of the best compared to similar games and with the competitve scene making a rise, I think this game will stick around for a long time.PROS:- Easy to pick up- Mechanics are phenomenal- Balanced- Microtransactions are purely cosmetic- Competitive play is implemented into the game- Customization is endless- Frequent updates- Good community- Never repetitive- Little to no bugs- Gameplay is just pure funCONS:- Smurfs- Ranking system is messed up- ""What a save!"""

84,99.6,Recommended," December 4, 2016",182,"Rocket League is an excellent game and one of my favourites. It's very easy to understand but hard to master.Optimisation is great and graphics are fantastic. The game also has a full controller support, but you can play with mouse and keyboard as well, so it's up to you how you want to play. I personally prefer the controller.After the first launch of the game, you will hear a fantastic music in the menu. After that, you can choose a car. Play the tutorial, and finally, you will be ready to play your first multiplayer game.In the game, there are a lot of cars and you can also buy paid DLCs. Cars from DLCs are technically the same. The only difference are hit boxes. According to developers, all of the cars have the same stats. Vehicles are customisable. For example, you can add an antenna, change wheels, colour, etc.Like I wrote above Rocket League is very easy to understand because, in the main mode, the game consists of controlling the giant ball and trying to score. To put it simply, it's just football with cars. You can choose between 1vs1, 2vs2, 3vs3, and 4vs4. The main modes are playable on casual and competitive modes. But there are also game modes which are more advanced like for instance ice hockey, basketball and my personal favourite RUMBLE. In RUMBLE rules are the same, but here, every ten seconds the game draws for you one special ability. For example grappling hook, a tornado or a freezer weapon.As I mentioned above, Rocket League has competitive matches. After ten games, you will get your rank. There are 15 ranks: PROSPECT (I, II, III, Elite) CHALLENGER (I, II, III, Elite), RISING STAR, ALL-STAR, SUPERSTAR, CHAMPION, SUPER CHAMPION, GRAND CHAMPION.The game rewards us in the form of points for all sorts of tricks, like aerials, bicycle hits, etc.The VerdictRocket League is a unique game with simple rules. If you haven't bought it yet, do it. You won't regret. My final rating is 10/10."

278,"2,558.7",Recommended," July 7, 2015",38,"Rocket League is a completely physics-based fast-paced sports game where cars play soccer. A very simple concept, but it's the most fun you could ever have in a video game. The learning curve is very steep, so you might struggle when you begin, but the game's addictive nature will probably grab you anyway and make you play for hours until you're too tired to even go to sleep, so you play more and you realize you've been playing 5 days non-stop and you're dead. Even though it's such a simple idea, there's so much you can do in this game. If you're a newcomer, don't forget to try flying! (Spoiler alert: It's f***ing awesome!)It also has great potential to become a big e-sports game, something that I'm really looking forward to.The list of features at the moment isn't huge, but hopefully the devs will add more things in future updates like they've promised. (Psyonix always keeps their promises, so I wouldn't worry about it!) The season mode is a great place for new players to practice their skills against the AI, but the online mode is where most of the fun of the game lies. And, the customization is sick. Oh and the insanely cool replay editor! Also new free maps in the future confirmed!All in all this game is very solid, very competitive and fun, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes skill-based games or is into sports.Better than FIFA. 10/10."

665,22.7,Recommended," January 3, 2017",152,"IntroductionI've often found myself with little pockets of time in which I've wondered, ""What should I do now?"". You know, those moments in time where you have too little time to play a really lengthy, story-driven game (or League of Legends), but way more time than you can feasibly sit and idle. It's as if our prayers were collectively answered with this fantastic game from Psyonix; Rocket League.Take out your controllers boys & girls, we're playing football....with cars.GameplayI've been playing games like Fifa and PES from the glory '98 days, but eventually my interests changed. After all, it was simply a game of football. There is only so much you can do with human players. Apparently Psyonix thought outside of the box. What they delivered was simply a stroke of genius. Gone were the human players we were accustomed to. Instead, rocket-powered cars jetted their way across the map in record speeds. This wasn't enough though. They altered the map, super-sized the ball, and set each player in control of only one car at a time.This formula gave birth to the high-intensity game of Rocket League. Your goal is to hit the massive ball into the opponent's goal. Sounds simple enough right? Wrong. With rocket jumps, speed boosts, rocket-propelled flight and the unique map shapes, you'll find yourself in an endless chase at breakneck speed for possession of the ball. While this game is absolutely beginner friendly, it has an insanely high skill-ceiling. In other words, no matter how good you think you are, there is someone who is leagues above you.Each team can have up to 5 players, though the 3v3 format is the standard mode, and has a nice balance between chaos and fun. The potential teamwork between players is definiely one of my favourite aspects, and promotes friendly behavior for those epic goals. Don't be surprised if you get called out for accidentally hitting the ball away from the opponent's goal, or worse, hitting it into your own.Quick-chat commands are rather peaceful, but after seeing 3 censored swear words, you'll probably get the idea. The sarcastic tones of ""What a Save!"" upon scoring a goal always gives me a chuckle, and the genuine compliments from opponents is a welcome breath of fresh air, and pride.Car selection & customization should probably be a mini-game on its own. With a wide variety of colours, hats, boost trails and decals to choose from, you'll likely have more than a few saved presets that you'll cycle through. With an ever-growing roster of cars and cosmetics, there's plenty to appeal to everyone.Speaking of appeal, there's much more than your classic game of football in Rocket League. Games such as basketball and hockey have found their way into the ever-growing list of game modes, and I often find myself cycling through them all quite frequently. Hell, even my 5 year old cousin loves it. Think you've got the skills to make it higher? You'll be happy to test your skills in the competitive mode. To be honest, I haven't really played much of this, since I prefer the other modes so much more.Don't let its colourful nature confuse you, rocket league is one beautiful & optimized game. I was pleasantly surprised to discover how easy it was to run on even some old potatoes, and its ability to be quite visually appealing on higher settings. The explosions and particle effects are both colourful and beautiful. The cars are nicely detailed, and the animations are right on point.If you for some reason haven't listened to Rocket League's soundtrack, get it...now. I find myself upset that it's not on by default while playing, but there are plenty of workarounds to really listen and enjoy the music all year round. The tracks are entertaining and insanely high quality.Soundtrack aside, the regular SFX are no less impressive. Vehicle sounds, explosions, and the 'fake crowd' cheering are just a few of the many things this game has to offer for your audiophile needs.Whether you've got only 5 minutes to spare, or an entire afternoon, Rocket League offers hours of addictive fun that never seems to grow old. This unique spin on a timeless sport is sure to appeal to a very wide audience, and you can be sure that your experience is likely gonna be a great one.For $20, this game is worth full price, but you can always get it on sale pretty often.I rarely grant this one but,10/10 - Just simply fun, addicting and worth every penny.Props to the devs for showing that an independent team could release such a big hit without submitting to the horrible DLC practices of modern gaming.This endorsement approved by ,providing better standards for reviews and reviewers."
520,794.2,Recommended," January 21, 2017",92,"As a competitive gamer, it's not often I'm able to find a game that continues to be enjoyable while I'm getting completely dominated; but Rocket League delivers that perfectly. I've played for almost 400-hours and I have yet to figure out why, exactly, this game is so fun to so many different people from so many walks of life. But whatever the reason, Psyonix has delivered a near-flawless hybrid cross between a Single-Character-Controlled Sports game (Soccer, Hockey, Basketball), a Racing game, a Flying game, and a competitive multiplayer experience.Pros:- Replayability is consistent.- Servers cover /many/ regions. (Most of the world.)- No single Battlecar has a distinct advantage in all fields over every other Battlecar. (There are pros and cons to every Battlecar.)- Battlecar customizability feels endless.- Fun for casual gamers.- Fun for competitive gamers.- Quick 5-minute matches so you aren't forced to risk losing after 45-minutes.- Split-screen playable Local OR Online.- Psyonix listens to players and integrates desired features.- This Pros list could go on and on.Cons:- Not the easiest game to just pick up and play.-- New players may become discouraged by having difficulty hitting the ball at all. (Don't give up! You'll get it down relatively quickly!)- Online players can be incredibly rude (as with any online multiplayer game).- It takes a LOT of time to become a skilled player.- In-game voice chat quality is unbearable. (Most players use third-party VoIP programs to avoid this issue.)It has been years since I've found a game that has me as addicted and dedicated as I am to Psyonix's Rocket League. This is a game I'll be playing for a long, long time.9.5/10EDIT: Paid DLC is not completely cosmetic, as DLC Battlecars have different hitboxes and turn radiuses than base cars. This, however, does not make any paid DLC Battlecar specifically better than base Battlecars. Every Battlecar has its pros and cons between hitboxes and turn radiuses."

You find yourself constantly saying 'Just one more game' over and over and over again because you literally cannot just put it down. It's simple: a car arena like showdown on a soccer field with one giant ball and a bunch of boost to fill your rocket powered dreams, but don't be fooled because this game is much deeper than it will originally look. Psyonix takes a very simlpe core idea and allows us to do whatever we want with it because of its purely physics based gameplay.What does this give us though? Let me tell you. Satisfyingly tight controls, action packed multiplayer, awe inspiring aerial goals, sniper tactics, competitive and casual matchmaking, hours of laughing and enjoyment, TONS of explosions (Mr. Torgue aproved), an incredibly balanced game, all future maps will be free, PC to PS4 crossplay, over 150 items for purely cosmetic customizations, and over 10billion of said combinations.I can really only say so much about the game itself (partly because English was my worst course :P) but what I really cannot stress enough is that you won't be staying for just the game alone. You'll be seeing Psyonix as one of the only developers left that actually understand what we want as well as falling in love with the community.The community of Rocket League (and SARPBC for that matter) is probably the most open, friendly and supportive community I have come accross. Of course this is being said before release and I really hope that you new players please uphold our standard of ingame complements, willingness to help out anyone that wants to learn, and general good sportsmanship. If you find yourself running into a few bad apples, don't worry about it, as you climb up the ladder into the ranks with the rest of the long time players you'll notice the warmer atmosphere to say the least :)Now I suppose I should say that within the last week I've apparently played nearly 90hrs and that's just playing private matches with the same people constantly. Some would think that I'd be bored after that, but you'd be so so wrong. I can play all day, get into bed and watch some Rocket League videos, and then immediately want to play more (I may or may not be addictive :| but don't think you're immune).Anyways, I'm going to play some more Rocket League.

But since the same developer Psyonix stay behind Rocket League, their experience allowed them to address problems and improve the game (as well as shorten the name :P).Rocket League provides fast 5 minute rounds inside a box-shaped arena. The edges of the arena are curved to allow players to drive up walls and even on the ceiling. The team size can range from one to four players on each team.The gameplay is fast and because of the playingfield's small size goals can be scored from the other side of it, since there are no obstacles in the way other than a potentional defending player. Blocking the ball and doing a counterattack right afterwards happens within seconds and can turn an entire game.There are multiple car models to choose from, but their handling or top speed does not differ. Only the hitbox of the cars are slighly different - which creates some tiny variation in the ball interaction. However the main purpose of having multiple cars is to customize it without interfering or imbalancing the gameplay. This works very well and choosing a car is a personal preference rather than a statistical battle to determine which car is the best. The car customization comes with color, surface type, additional decal, wheels, antenna, goofy hats and particles for the rocket trail.""Rocket trail?"" you may ask. Well, in Rocket League every car has a Rocket Engine attached to its back allowing to boost itself to greater speed. The best part is that you can jump and shoot yourself into the air with it and being able to fly. This creates gameplay in all three dimensions. Instead of just dribbling the ball on the ground, you can launch yourself into the air and hit the ball before your enemy can. It is not easy and adds a decent learning-curve to the game.The game is very polished. The options menu allows key rebinding serparatly for keyboard and controller, very in-depth adjustments to the camera position/behaviour as well as a large choice of grafic options for the Unreal Engine 3.Textures are very detailed, particle effects very well made. The grass on the ground is fantastically animated. Even though the arena/stadiums are the same, there are four different theme versions, ranging from a raining indoor park to a full blown stadium with thousand of people cheering.The cars handle very well, can turn fast and stick to the ground unless you want and tell them to drift. Once airborne keeping the control of the car or wanting to do what you want is difficult but not impossible. The physic engine of the game does it's work very well. The ball itself is predictable and doesn't behave random at all.You unlock new parts for your car customization after completing each game - no matter the outcome of the match. The account progress is ok, but nothing incredible or important. This game shines when it comes to it's gameplay.The sound effects as well as grafical effects while playing or just driving around are incredible enjoyable. Boosting to full speed makes you feel powerful, ramming people and even destroying them creates satisfing explosions. And when scoring a goal the ball explodes and creates a shockwave on which you can ride on with your rocket launcher. Directly afterwards you get a replay of the goal in slow motion. At the end of the game you can save a replay of the entire game and watch it whenever you want.Setting up goals and blocking the ball also feel rewarding by the system and on a team-spirit basis.Since the game has high skill ceiling, experienced players can crush any other ones. The matchmaking system works very well in that regard, that you get matched up with equally good players and even indicates if it doesnt find them and slowly extends it's skill range in order to find players as fast as possible. You can group up to play together in normal and ranked games.You also have the choice of selecting multiple regional servers such as Europe, Oceanic, West- and East-America, as well as queueing up for multiple modes (e.g. 1vs1 and 3v3) at the same time. The game will put you in the first fitting game it can find for you.The game also provides a singleplayer campaign against the AI, as well as tutorials and training for various parts of the game such as defending the goal and scoring goals. For those who just want to get used to the controls or test can hop into the sandbox mode.I also like to mention that you can queue up for an online game from any menu or singleplayer gamemode. So while searching you can play around in sandbox mode.As announced by Psyonix, the first major update hit Rocket League. I first was disappointed that they want to go the DLC route. Not because i dont like to pay for content, but more because of the bad reputation the word 'DLC' has nowadays, fearing that Rocket League gets looked down for doing this markt strategie. But my fear should vanish.The first DLC just includes two new car and customization items for a small price. The real update includes free stuff for everyone. New map, new specator mode, better ranked play, improved main menu background, and so on. With the new update the 20€ i pay for the game are even more worth it. And Psyonix plans are to keep going, maybe even into the direction of modding and crazy maps.So yes. I am excited for every upcomming Update and DLC.I recommend this game to everyone. May it be casual players, those who play in a group to have fun together as well as the ones who like play competitively. Playing this game has the perfect fun/frustration balance and great learning curve."

71,486.4,Recommended, March 9,52,"Where do I begin, Rocket League is truly a game like no other. Unlike other types of games such as the fps genre where your prior skill in the genre helps you adapt to game your new to, Rocket League doesn't.If your looking for a game you can play with a couple of friends and really grind and practice to see your self get to that level of skill you want to be at, this is it.Nobody is good when they start but its easy to get a hold of and just as hard to master the mechanics because players are always finding new ways to score goals.Im terrible at this game, but I keep coming back, because this game isn't just about rising through the ranks or being at the top of the leaderboard its about testing yourself...Every shot, every wall dribble and every fake is the result of practice and reading your opponents theres hardly any RNG and nothing feels better then getting a shot you've been trying to get for hours, days or even weeks.This is because the game is hard, but it never gets old or too difficult.Devs care about community, and are trying to be more transparent.So get ready for some What A Save!

Easy to learn, hard to master. It doesn’t start dull, it is fun right from the start as a beginner, and it only gets better as you improve.It involves a very wide range of skills which gives the gameplay a lot of variety by constantly engaging your different abilities. I don’t mean variety as in different environments or doing different things, rather the variety applies to the ways in which the game demands your participation both physically (mechanical skills, accuracy, timing, consistency, …) and mentally (spatial awareness, intuition for the game’s physics like momentum or bounces, team coordination, …), pretty much like a real sport. This makes it one of the most fulfilling video games to play.Rocket League is the video game that feels the closest to real life sports. It involves the same kind of skills and provides the same kind of fun. Absolutely recommended to everyone!"

Yeah, you hear all the glowing reviews, but sometimes you need to experience it for yourself. So I bought the game, on sale for $11.20 (USD), and was able to quickly find a friend to play with.The first thing I did was try the tutorial, which impressed me on how tight and responsive the conrols are. That was a really good sign for a sport where control is necessary. Next we jumped into an match with easy bots and I scored a goal in the first 4 seconds. OK, I was not expecting that to feel so satisfying. That was the exact point that the hook was set.It is not easy to score goals. You wait back at midfield for the right time to speed burst towards a centered pass only to see it go wide or deflect off another player. You circle back and try to attack again and again. Time goes by, and then you find yourself colliding with a teammate and happen to bump into the ball that trickles just fast enough to cross the goal line before the opponent can fly over to stop it. The feeling of triumph floods over you and you cannot stop your grin from growing over your face.I am not even 2 hours in at this point and I already see the promise this game holds. The potential for great fun with friends is there, and that's the key. I find myself looking forward to my next match. I can't wait to get out there and drive around like a crazed lunatic and smash some buddies into the wall."

Usually I am not that much into racing games, which isn't really too much of a problem since I wouldn't exactly call it a typical racing game. Still it uses familiar driving mechanics and combines it with the most basic soccer rules. 2 teams of rocket-boosted-cars try to catapult, push, nitro-boost or bump an oversized football into the other teams goal.On the ""battlefield"" you find small nodes which add a little to your boost-meter, which is quite limited and you have to carefully time the use of you nitro-boost - if it's time to defend and you find yourself in the other team's half you are not going to get there on time. If the ball is on the way to your opponent's goal you will want to have as much boost as possible to ""kick"" the ball as hard as you can and also to outrace the other players.You can jump and even double-jump with your car, you can flip and turn in any direction whilst in the air in order to maximize your blocking possibilites and to kick the ball with a spinning move of your car's rear. It's hard to describe but play it for 1 hour and you will get what I mean. :)Rocket League is crazy, it involves a lot of skill but does not have a particularly steep learning curve. There are only so many moves you can make and the real challenge is to master them all. Matchmaking works like a charm, new games are found quickly and you can decide wether you want to play ranked or just for the fun of it.I imagine if you play 3v3 together with 2 friends on your team this game gets even greater.The only things I would wish for in future updates are a little more map variation and some different game modes.Since there is pretty much only one stadium with several different textures and lighting, things could get a tad repetitive after a while. I can really see the potential of ramps being in there, maybe some minor upgrades/boosts ready for pickup and so on... You could go really crazy expanding the existing formula.Other than that - I can recommend this without any shadow of a doubt!"

689,910.3,Recommended," September 28, 2016",52,"Intro:Rocket League is a sequel to the less-known vehicular football video game Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars developed and published by Psyonix. The game was first released in July 2015 for PC and PS4 and got a Xbox One version earlier this year. There are an OS X and Linux versions planned to be released this year. A lot of people (myself included) had never heard of SARPBC until they tried Rocket League out.Base Concept:The base concept for this game as simple as it gets: combine football with cars and try to defeat the opponent team. The idea sounds pretty simple and many would think that it will be easier to play than actual football games such as FIFA or PES. If you are one of those people, then you're suddenly mistaken.The game is easy to understand but often you'll end up having to put effort into it in order to succeed. It is challenging and usually you will have to fly in air in order to get or shoot the ball. You are awarded XP points which are assigned to you after the end of every match. Those XP points are the ones that make you actually ""level up"" in the game. There are 2 different types of ranks: normal and competitive ones. Normal ones are gathered by levelling up while the competitive ranks are gathered by playing the competitive game modes.The game consists of a couple game modes: standard football ones, basketball (named Hoops) and the chaotic Rumble mode that features around 10 special items you can use to give yourself the advantage while your team has the possession of the ball and Dropshot. Due to the arenas being not as big as they are in real life, having 22 players chasing 1 ball would be, to say the least, too chaotic. For that sake, Psyonix decided to restrict teams to a maximum of four players per team.Matches consisting of 1 to 3 cars are optimal ones while the ones featuring 4 cars per team are, although no less entertaining, reasonably marked as ""Chaos"". Then there are the Hoops, Rumble and Dropshot game modes, first of which is basically basketball combined with cars while the second one represents the already known combination of football and cars, this time with some special effects and items which can help you to score some goals. The last one got introduced in 2017 and doesn't allow the team to lose the ball on their side of the arena.The game surely is entertaining and even if you were never a fan of either football or racing, this game may take your interest. The game has some collision model problems (not really bugs, but just unoptimized car collisions) which can be noticed in goal replays. Sometimes, you can clearly see the ball flying away even though visually, you didn't actually hit it. That is not a very big problem, though, and it happens only when your car's front is supposed to hit the ball.On the keyboard, the controls feel great and are just like you'd expect them to be. The game features boost pickups which you can use to temporarily speed up your car or for flying like a rocket (obviously representing the name of the game itself). Sadly, the matchmaking is not very optimized and from time to time, a ""semi-pro"" or a ""pro"" ranked player will have to play against an ""expert"" or even a ""master"". That is, of course, not fair.Would be a bad thing to forget the car customization. Beside limited modding support, you can customize your cars with tons of different body colors, wheels, trails, antennas and items to put on the top of your car (literally hats for cars). Last, but not least, it's the first game to have ever featured cross-platform play. You can play with Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch owners.Rocket League is running on the Unreal Engine 3. Its visuals are colorful and look simply beautiful. The arenas are filled with different colors (mostly the team colors) and some of them even have country flags hanging around them. All the arenas (excluding the rocket labs) have similar layouts and a pretty unique theme.The 3D main menu is set in one of the arenas and you can rotate the camera to see different angles of your car which is very helpful especially when it comes to car customization. There are tons of different options that can improve the effects in-game or the actual game experience. On the lowest settings, the game certainly looks pretty bad. Sadly, it is not well optimized and often tends to have performance issues on low-end PCs.This game is a really awesome example of how an interesting combination of 2 totally different things with great execution can be strong and not require tons of features in order to get players return to it on a daily basis. With over 50K players on a daily basis, this game promises to bring you a lot of fun, excitement and even anger. It's one of those games that are really easy to learn and understand, but very difficult to master. If you do have some time and are looking for a way to burn hours in which you are bored, this is the right thing to go for.The matchmaking needs optimization and there are some features (such as demolishing other players) that are very often (ab)used by other players for the sake of preventing you of defending or scoring, or how many people like to call it - dirty playing."
319,300.1,Recommended," July 10, 2015",108,"This game is as addicting as FIFA soccer is. I do however recommend it with prudence. This game is action packed but can be seen simplistic by a few.I've played the game back in alpha and didn't much care for it. I like it now more than previously, which is an extremely good thing.Rocket league is a soccer game played with RC cars. Obviously, the goal is to get the ball into the opponents net. Cars are given a few abilities to mix up the game. They can easily scale and drive on walls, and even up side down on the roof for a period of time (or longer with enough turbo). Boost or turbo is another feature in game. To acquire turbo, players must drive over small hot spots spread throughout the terrain. Some hot spots give minor turbo boosts while others will fill up the gauge all the way. Boosts when timed correctly, can produce a power hit on the ball. Some boosts when held down for a certain amount of time engage in some sort of ultra speed. When going this fast and if a player is in your way, you have the ability to literally run through and destroy the opponent.I am a huge fan of games which feature double jump, and rocket league has it! The first jump is a bit of a slow jump, while the second provides for another boost upwards, forwards, to the side or in reverse. While in the air, the player has quite a bit of flexibility to move about. This trick comes in hand when attempting to defend or attempting to knock the ball in an awkward angle. It can look pretty cool when done right. There are no power-ups within the games so this fact alone may turn a few people away from the game... this is only of course if you play competitive. Non-competitive games feature power-ups. None the less, the devs took a simplistic approach to keep the game engaging. The matchmaking that is available is organized very neatly and local co-op is an extremely appreciated feature. Matchmaking is a bit funny to me in the sense where if only four players are available, it will add two AI's instead of allowing for a 2v2 vote. Again, it's not a big deal as empty slots are filled up with AI's (sometimes extremely annoying AI's that score on themselves). This however only applies in non-competitive mode which for the most part is ok. A neat feature is there is an arrow that indicates where the ball is off screen. Additionally, there is a circle marker on the ball to show where and how far up in the air is the ball. Players can press Y to change the camera view off the car and toward the ball. The player can also choose to toggle the lock button for the camera.are well done and nothing seems cut short. You can optimize for performance or quality (whoot whoot)! There are different stages in the game but they are limited (or I should say were limited). A few more ""out of this world"" stages have been added for free which is greatly appreciated. The customizations regarding the cars are absolutely well done. From custom paint jobs, custom wheels, to even custom hats (that for some weird reason keep your goal count). My only complaint if I can have one is the DLC purchases for new car skins... but hey, who am I to judge. The menu's and the UI was also well done and everything is kept simple and neat. The in game have improved since it's start. I love how different boosts all have a different sound and some even play music. This is really paying attention to detail. The sound tracks in general are pretty catchy. That could be part in fact I've also heard them numerous times.The game is quite exciting and cars seemingly fly everywhere. It's enjoyable when everyone crashes into the ball, but it is even more delightful when people start calculating hits and play positions.For future Rocket League DLC's or games, it would be nice to see some mini-games! The main part of the game is excellent, but imagine adding some modifications to it. Perhaps adding power-ups could give an alternative to matchmaking.Overall good game, and I would recommend it to most people. There are a few friends that are reluctant to get into it, but for the most part it has received positive reception.***Dec 2016 update : there are new game modes that involve other sports such as hockey or basket ball. I think this is a neat step as it creates many new opportunities. They are not available in competitive mode, but are still very fun to play. You're essentially a flying projectile whenever you wish. When you get the hang of flying, this game's opportunities start flying wide open. Very simplistic game but you can definitely see the skill range of some players is phenomenal. Unlike FIFA where you would get discouraged, I'm sure you'll start challenging yourself when you see some of these crayz stunts.RATING : 8.1/10"

I only played a couple of matches!)It doesn’t matter if you are a racing/football fan or not. You’ll love it. This game appeals to both casual and competitive players. You will suck most of the time and sometimes score amazing goals and it would feel incredible! This is one of those games that is easy to learn and very hard to master. I am still horrible at it after 100 hours. The good thing is that it is still entertaining even if you are losing more often than winning.So is it a great game? Hell, yes! Do I recommend it? No, unless you want to get sucked in and get addicted to this devil’s child of a game.I got it for free with Steam hardware. At this point I am ready to pay $20 just to get rid of it.

People might be toxic in matchmaking, but the real competitive community (RLCS) is amazing.The only downside in my eyes is that it's difficult to play this game with friends that are (relatively) new to the game.

730,191.2,Recommended," December 8, 2016",52,"Psyonix's magnum opus, Rocket League, is one of the most fun games I've had the joy to play. The master of fast-paced, addictive gameplay, the 5 minute matches keep you playing into the early hours of the morning and never failing to keep the action above 60mph! The vertical flexability that the openness of a Rocket League pitch offers is incredible, boasting a Cirque de liberté for you to perform all sorts of zany twists and turns in mid-air, it's remarkable to see glorious goals and superb saves made by some of the insanely talented players. One can better their Rocket League play naturally, by simply enjoying the game, however, the more difficult tricks like; aerials, freestyles, dribbling and perfect positioning take some serious skill and precision and are a sight to see in competitive play. The game's perfectly playable with either a controller or mouse 'n' keyboard, so it's up to you to decide how you play. The customisation is great, fine-tuning your Rocket-Powered Battle-Car is fantastic and the options are near endless, offering plenty of choice. However, there is microtransactions. But, these are implemented in one of the best ways I've seen in any game, they're not intrusive or necessary for victory AT ALL, they're simply cosmetic. The free Rumble gamemode is serious fun and it's nice to see the devs frequently adding new features and stadiums to one of the most fun games of 2015. I don't care too much for either cars or football, but I adore Rocket League. Totally worth its full price and it's a steal on sale, highly recommended."

26,873.7,Recommended," October 28, 2017",41,"My friend brought his ps4 over to my house during the beta because he ""Knew I would love it"". Since then I have put over 2000 hours into RL and have bought it for ps4, xbox, and pc with absolutely no regrets. The game is fun as both a friendly party game and as a more serious competitive multiplayer game. Over the months I have watched RL expand with new game modes and so many customization options its almost difficult for me to remember what it was like in the begginning. I would recommend this game to anybody who likes the idea of a fast paced multiplayer game that truly feels like its own unique sport.Summary pros and cons list for those who prefer that:Pros- Fast paced action that last in 7-8 minute spurts allowing you to play and have fun for short or long game sessions- Thousands of customization options with an item trade system- Many different games modes to suit a player's desired level of competitveness and add variety- Easy to pick up and play but will take many hundreds (maybe a couple thousand) of hours to reach the highest ranks of the game.- Rank system does a decent job of giving consistent fun competitve matches- SO MUCH FUN- Even more fun to play with friends- Can be played at a high level with controller or keyboard and mouse. (General consensus controller is better though)- I have made many good online friends through this gameNeutral- The game has a crate system for many of the customization items. Besides a few exclusize items every item is tradable so it is absolutely possible to get even the valuable crate items through trading. However, if you're deadset on collecting every item in the game (very difficult these days) or some of the more valuable items it will take you orders of magnitude less time to just pay for them. Thankfully though none of the items have any effect on your in game performance. They are purely asthetic so there is no pay to win.-Addictive. I have no idea the number of times I have thought to myself ""one more game"" and the played for 2 more hours.Cons- There are people that smurf and boost accounts. Personally I think this is unavoidable in a competitve game and I don't think RL is worse than any other popular multiplayer competitve game. I have seen many negative reviews complaining about this but I don't believe it is a huge issue and Psyonix has taken and I believe will continue to take steps to counter those players that are truly abusing the system.- Sometimes other players are rude. I have been told I am a trash-teammate many times while solo queuing. People are jerks sometimes. RL is no worse than anyother game that allows text chat. It doesn't happen that often but I thought it would be inappropriate to at least not acknowledge that this behavior happens in the game from time to time. You always have the option as a player to turn off text chat entirely or just mute players as you choose. I have also noticed that since Psyonix but in place an auto ban system for certain words and just in general improved the potentcy of their ban system over time this type of behavior has decresed. Also anybody complaining about getting banned unjustly for an extended periosd of time in this game is almost certainly lying.- The servers are not perfect. Sometimes the servers lag. Sometimes I randomly get bad ping while playing. Rarely I disconnect from a game and am unable to recconnect and therefore suffer a 15 minute ban from disconnecting from a ranked match. Again just wanted to acknowledge that these things do occassionally happen but it is rare and harldy ever gives me a negative feeling towards the game."

This game is unbelievably fun, even if you dont like this sort of game, i'm yet to meet anyone who has a bad word to say about Rocket League. This is a game that anyone can pick up, no matter what your skill level is, however the skill cap for this game is incredibly high, so it's fun for the casual gamer and the hardcore gamers. I would reccommend this to literally anyone, and i challenge you to play it and not like it!10/10 A game i will player for hundreds of hours!"

The rockets add a layer of grace and skill that is hard to describe and is best experienced live. There are literally hundreds of Wow! and OMG! moments to be had. Rocket League has turned into one of my favorite multiplayer games, and I don't even like soccer!The game has a large, but linear learning curve as you progress to the higher ranks. Start off learning the fundamentals like basic offense, defense, and blocking shots. Then as you get better, you improve dribbling skills, centering techniques, team positioning, plus hard and soft shots. As you advance further, you become proficient at wall shots, aerials, epic saves, and bad shot recovery. I have played nearly 200 hours and I still feel like I'm learning and improving my game.I find the game intensely addicting with its 5 minute matches. Once one game is over, I'm ready to start another and it's almost impossible to just play a single game. As my skills improve, it fuels my incentive to keep playing more.They recently added a hockey modification which is amazingly good as well. I'd venture to say I like it even better than the original game.I can't praise Rocket League enough. It has the right mixture of speed, adrenaline, and fun."

1,726.3,Recommended," August 30, 2015",400,"Rocket League Review""Lets play some Carball!""Rocket League is a game which combines soccer and reckless driving. It is a sequel to the game SARPBC, Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars and it is produced by Psyonix. It includes cross-platform play between PS4 and PC, having an huge playerbase currently.You will have lots of fun with this game guaranteed! The controls are ultra-simple to use, you will get used to them in a blink of an eye. I play the game with a controller, which for me it is the best way to play it, but it is enjoyable to play with the keyboard + mouse too. The game itself is ultra fun! The ball physics with the rebounds and all feel impressively well, as the cars handling. It is incredibly easy to play, yet extremely difficult to master. You also have to use strategy in this game in order to win the matches, much like regular soccer. If you are just a ball chaser you will have difficult times winning, you have to think about your positioning and timing very well. You can also do incredible trick shots and jump shots due to your boost, which are incredible hard to master, but after some time you will start to get the hang of it. The worst part are some camera angles and the bots AI, but unless you plan on only playing offline games, the AI wont be much of a problem. It feels so good to make some incredible plays, even when you fail you will have tons of laughs. It is a very simple game with simple ideas, yet they work perfectly and make this game a blast to play for both casual and professional players.The longevity of a game which relies on an multiplayer-focused game can be debatable, but in this one I am sure you will spend enough hours to compensate the money you spend in the game. At the moment I have spent 35 hours and intend to spend many more. You have tons of cars, paint jobs, hats and other customization stuff to unlock during the game that will keep you entertained for the first hours (I unlocked everything in around 20 hours). You also have 4 different game-modes (1vs1, 2vs2, 3vs3, 4vs4) which give some good diversity since each one of the modes has its own strategies to follow in order to win them. You also have an offline season mode available to play, but it is kind of boring in my opinion given the multiplayer options you have. Practice mode is also available, a great place to tune your skills up. The ranks and leaderboards system will also entertain you, it is great to climb up against your friends in the diverse list of leaderboards available.Only have good things to say here too. By the moment you enter the game you will know you are in for something special. Slick menus with an ultra easy interface plus amazing songs will make you excited right at the first time you open the game. You got plenty of voice commands to use in-game which is definitely a plus presentation wise. Now the graphics. Another win in this spectacular game. Great graphics for a game this simple. All works really well, the colors, grass, car details, everything looks great. The level of detail in the cars and their customization objects is great too. These are some impressive visuals, even though the main focus of the game is definitely not the graphics.The soundtrack in this game is amazing. I was totally not expecting it, there are really some great songs in it, got some of them stuck in my head. There are only around eleven songs in it, but most are awesome and don't get old. The various sounds in the game are also great, from the sounds of the different boost types, ball hits, drifts, crashes, everything works really well.This is the big deal in this game. And oh boy, how fun it is to play it with or against friends. You will have tons of fun making the best goals ever as well as the biggest fails in history. It really gives you tons of laughs. You have also the option to play ranked instead of casual games, which make for some more intense, fun matches! The playerbase is huge, around 100000 players are online in most of the time, so you will find games in a matter of seconds. The community is in it´s majority very friendly, but like in all multiplayer games, you will find some toxic people playing the game too. You also have different server regions to choose from so you can play without worrying about lag. Unfortunately I did have some crazy lags in some european servers. It is rare to find a laggy server but it happens and can get very frustrating, specially when you are playing ranked. Yet, I am sure the devs will fix most of the server issues soon, so no worries about that.9.0/10If you enjoy high octane reckless driving and the world's most popular sport, Rocket League is for you. It is one of the most fun multiplayer games released in the last years. The base price is great value for the game you get, which will get you hours and hours of great fun! Embrace the latest gaming trend in Steam and PS4 and have a blast playing this soccer-meets-cars gem!"

Come on.. anyone?) ended up being one of the most addictive games I’ve come to cross around.PROS-Everyone is on the same page. There is no difference in XP, Cars, Skins or anything. SKILLS are everything-Very fluid-No bugs (at least I haven’t found one)-Multi-Platform-Coop and Local CoopCONS-NO OFFLINE LAN. That kind of sucks… really. This would be a reason to NOT RECOMMEND a good game, but this game is pretty great, so I still give it a recommend (Oh yeah, I wan’t to hear those brats from US and EU talk about how everyone got internet now and we don’t need LAN Anymore, and this is a stupid complain.. please go ahead)-Servers give a connection problem all the time. I asked a lot of people, and I am getting the same answer from at least 40% of the people. Maybe is just here in South America, and playing with servers outside the ping goes over 200. The good thing is that the game does not become totally unplayable, especially for new, not all that skilled players (like myself :D)-No the best Match Making system ever, but this is not a Con per say… just not so great yet I thinkBut really.

If you are familiar with FIFA, then hold on, Rocket League has more to offer, it has cars which play football and though a weird idea, this game is based on this and delivers more fun than FIFA would give (no hate to FIFA lovers). Aerials, dribbles, flicks shots, all by using the car on the ball. There is a high skill ceiling and though easy to look at, this is so hard to master (1600hrs is nothing xD). You will fail but ultimately when you will succeed, the joy will be endless and when you will learn to fly and do your first aerial, then the feeling would be out of the world (literally ofc xD). TBH I am playing this game with heart and soul from the start as no game has kept me so much engrossed as this. Give it a try, you will love it.Suggestion for newbies:-Do trainings, watch pros(even watching this game is so entertaining), and practice hard to improve. I struggled enough to hit my first aerial but didn't lose my motivation when I failed to score and played miserably at times. Everyone will struggle but joys are hidden within this only ;).

573,719.3,Recommended," September 9, 2017",127,"Product received for freeThis is my go-to game on steam and also the one i've put the most hours into so i wanted to finally review it. I honestly don't ever see a time where i'll stop playing this, the gameplay never gets old. The physics are spot on for the ball and car handling. If you play Ranked then you will only ever choose 1 of 4 cars to play with that have the best physics, turning radius, hitbox etc.I will say that it's one of these games that you will either get into or you won't, there's no middle ground really. Actually originally i was gonna hold off on getting this but then i technically got it free when i bought a Steam Controller which came bundled with Rocket League and Portal 2, i woulda got it sooner if i knew how fun and addictive it was...or maybe i wouldn't have so i could spend more time playing all the steam games i neglect cos of this one lol.There are 4 standard game modes being 1v1, 2v2, 3v3 and chaos which is 4v4, 3v3 usually being the most played and also most balanced. 1v1 and 2v2 are the most tense, if you make a mistake in those modes you will pay for it. The 3v3 mode allows more leeway for mistakes. The chaos 4v4 mode is the most goofy fun one, but only new players tend to play that one, so it's hard to find a game of chaos with skilled opponents which is a shame.There are also special game modes which include an ice hockey one where the ball is now a puck that slides around the pitch. Hoops which is a 2v2 basketball mode (i'm not good at that mode). Rumble mode where you all get powerups which enable you to swap places with the enemy or mess with their driving physics, that mode is the most luck based, it's fun to play for 5 minutes but i honestly haven't played it since it released. I think Dropshot is the most recent mode where you have to score by breaking the ground away on the opponents side and drop the ball through the hole you created. That mode is pretty interesting and probably my fave along with the ice hockey one.Negatives would be that Psyonix are becoming increasingly greedy in how they priced the DLC cars. When they first introduced the DLC cars you got 2 for like £2.50 i think, and then it was about £1.60 to buy each car separately. And finally now to get new cars you have to f*ck with their crate and key system. No longer can you just....you know buy a f*cking car you might want! you need to buy a key or set of keys to open a crate which among other useless cosmetic items MIGHT contain the car you want.I'm not spending £20 on keys to unlock 2 cars, or spending hours trying to trade crates or a number of cosmetics with people, i don't play this game to trade, If anyone that works at Psyonix reads this can you please give us the option of buying the cars outright again, i don't think it's too much to ask in all honesty. Rule number one of game development should be don't force your playerbase to use a system they hate, especially when you used to be able to buy the cars from the store.I think a lot of more casual players may not even realise that there are new cars you can only get through the crate system. I know some fanboys may defend these practices because some of the money goes to the Rocket League esports division. My question is why am i being asked to pay for someone elses prize pool? Why don't Psyonix pay the winners through sponsorships or something like wtf really, makes no sense to me.The other negative and it's a big one, the one that will turn you off the game is the playerbase, this community is the worst i've experienced, i don't play CS:GO so i'm sure that's worse but dude, you will play against or with the most childish, racist, immature and fickle gamers you can imagine. One minute your own teammate will praise you for scoring or saving a goal and the next they will spam ""what a save"" over and over when they hit the ball passed your own goal and you fail to save it in time, i had this happen to me yesterday.There are players who will start playing against your team if you hit them by accident or don't let them have the ball for 90% of the game, hell sometimes they just start playing against you for no reason at all. I will say i think the verbal abuse through the chat window has gotten better, you can disable the chat and also report people, i think Psyonix may actually temp ban people now for that kinda stuff, i've seen people on the forums complaining about being banned for that.If it were up to me i would get rid of all of the chat and emote spamming from the game altogether. This is the other thing about it, people use the emote spam to save face when they miss the ball to pin a mistake on you, telling you to ""take the shot"" or spamming ""centering"" or ""in position"" when they just handed the ball to the other team, then when the other team scores cos of their mistake they will spam ""What a save"" at their teammates.I'm not saying i'm amazing at this game, i can admit that i'm average, i'll go for weeks without playing this sometimes and then suck when i come back to it. I'm only Gold II in ranked right now. I think that gives me a good broad perspective on the playerbase though. A tip would be to disable chat and also don't play ranked when you are new cos that's just messed up, learn to play and then join ranked mode.To be more positive you do get nice players from time to time, but they are few and far between and also to be honest it actually comes across as creepy to me when they are nice to you in the chat, it's so jarring to what i'm used to lol.The matchmaking system also needs to be reconfigured, some games will have you matched with a whole team who may be 2 or 3 levels higher than yours or vice versa. This happens more often than you would think.The game offers a lot of content and different game modes though, Psyonix also continually adds new free stadiums and game modes through updates so the game feels fresh and continues to evolve over time."

It really is the sort of game that just about everyone could have a great time playing, and you don't even have to be good at it, or like sports.The only real downside to this game, if you do intend to play online, is the terrible nature of the community (like with most online games). It's probably best just to disable both voice and text chat in the options, as almost nobody says anything of value. Even the quick-chat is highly abused and used by players mostly just to taunt and harass others.It really is a must-buy, though, especially if you're looking for a fun game that actually has an active player base."

101,243.7,Recommended," May 8, 2017",27,"The idea of supersonic cars playing soccer is a little strange, but Rocket League is one of my favorite multiplayer games.It has a very high skill cap. I’ve been playing it for almost 200 hours and I still have a lot to learn. Overall, it’s easy to play, but hard to be good at. If you want to know more about that, I suggest watching some montages of the gameplay.At the time this review was written, there are nine casual game modes (but that number will probably grow), including hockey, basketball, and more standard modes. All the different modes are truly awesome. The game mode with the most players is 4v4, the least is 1v1. Ranked currently has four modes: 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, and solo 3v3 (where each player solo queues).There’s also many different arenas, and more will probably be added.When I play competitively, I realize that there’s a lot of strategy in terms of positioning, ball control, and communication. I think one of the most important things is to coordinate your efforts. It’s sometimes difficult to communicate when solo queuing, and that can lead to multiple players going for the ball at the same time and ensuing in chaos. However, when you do communicate, the teamwork makes the success ten times more rewarding.The community is a mixed bag. I’ve met some pretty salty players, but that’s why there’s a mute button. I also run into many people who are very friendly and try to communicate. Most people, whether friendly or not, spam “Savage!” and “Wow!” whenever anyone scores a goal.This game fits any mood – whether it’s falling asleep at your desk at 3:00 am, playing super seriously, or just messing around.For me, it never gets boring. There is always room for improvement, there is nothing as rewarding as scoring a sick aerial goal."

Or I guess Rocket League?Rocket League is one of those ideas you're surprised has not been done yet. But it's totally been done before. What Rocket League does is refine, simplify, and intensify.is the result of a well-refined concept that's made it's debut back in 2008 as . While SARPBC had a whole lot more modes, maps and content, is a lot more light in content, but that's because that was something the devs didn't focus on. Instead, is a much more refined and focused game.The game plays and feels amazing, and this is because of what's changed since then. The cars have weight to them, which gives the player the feeling that they have much more control.It's team-based play is also very solid, because you're playing as an individual player, there's a lot of real coordination and technique that makes it so different from playing, say Fifa. It's so refreshing to play a sport game that brings out something that most of those games don't, and it's the indidviduality of the players. The want to stand out among others, or to stay behind and support your friends, that's the ingenuity of .It does lack in content however. It may be offputting that the simple, Soccer-based mode is really the only mode in the game, and a lot of the maps are in a similar layout, but that's what makes this game feel so refined. It's excusable because it's so fun to continue playing match after match. It's like Soccer;It's presentation is solid too. It has a surprisingly beast soundtrack, with the likes of Hollywood Principle stealing the show. It's visuals, while not on par with big Triple AAA games, looks crisp and beautiful. The grass on the fields look mighty damn shiny, and the cars models are smiplistic and detailed.Psyonix did a fantastic job taking a good concept, execute it once, and refine it years later into a much more enjoyable experience. Rocket League may not have a ton of maps, or game modes, but what it has is a game that will continues to amaze (and♥♥♥♥♥♥ me to all sorts of levels."

290,524.3,Recommended," December 23, 2015",15,"I was recommended this game after offhandedly mentioning it to a friend, and it ended up being one of my favourite games of the year. Where to start? It's multiplayer focused football with cars. Some people seem to dismiss it as a simple game that will get boring fast, but I would disagree. The game's core mechanics are so well polished that playing feels fluid and natural from the get-go, especially if you play racing games. The car handling is very simple, nothing like the likes of GRID or GTA IV. I think this handling system is good for the game, complex handling mechanics (gear systems, realistic turning, etc) would probably hamper the experience, when the game can be very fast paced and precision heavy at times. At higher levels of play you will use your boost to fly through the air, tilting your car to direct it towards the ball in mid-air. This requires practice and precision, and is very satisfying when executed correctly. This game has a high skill ceiling in that regard, where goals and saves can be pulled off, and the difficulty of them can skyrocket depending on the situation.The multiplayer is good, there are dedicated servers, in fact ONLY dedicated servers, which is something I've never really come to think about. The game modes range from 4v4, 3v3, 2v2 to 1v1. All are different in how they are played, but 3v3 is the mode I play the most and the mode that is considered ""standard"" in the game. In 3v3 you can learn about player rotation on the pitch, defensive roles, attacking roles and backup roles. Look these up on the steam guides if you are curious. The servers are split into casual and ranked games, where casual games do not impact your MMR or ""elo"" but do give you EXP and affect your all-time stats, and ranked games will impact your ranked points and MMR as well as your all-time stats. The ranked system uses points to monitor progress, starting at around 200, and you gain points on victory and lose them when you lose a match. I play this game alone mostly, and an issue I have with casual games were teamstacking in 3v3 games, where I would be matched against 3 players who were all friends, and the games would be fairly one-sided from having to play against a team that most likely communicated their play amongst themsleves. Since switching to ranked games I have not felt the urge to go back, there is even a mode called ""Solo Standard"" which is exclusively for single players looking to play 3v3 without the worries of facing a coordinated team.Teamplay is a large part of rocket league, all modes except 1v1 require coordination to be played well, perhaps with the exception of 4v4 mode appropriately named ""Chaos"" where there are so many cars that strategy and balance dips from having too many cars on the pitch at once. You will have to learn simple things like proper round start etiquitte, player rotation, setting up passes, scoring goals from passes, scoring aerials, outmaneuvering the opponent, and so on. The community is a mixed bag, sometimes you will encounter jerks who spam chat-commands ironically, sometimes you will have a pleasant game full of sportsmanlike players. So not that different from most other communities, I'd say. You can even turn text chat off if you want to.Overall I can say that this game is one of my favourite games of the year, and I will continue to play it... indefinetely? Maybe."

You'll watch a few youtube videos and get better, remap keys, buy a controller, buy keys, open crates, be dissapointed, find out about trading.

It's not pay to win, so anyone can do just as well without spending any extra money.It is also optional to play with either keyboard + mouse (like myself for 1,450 hours) or use a controller. While a controller allows for more specific angles, the game is still as fun without it. You can still get a professional level on keyboard + mouse, it is just preference, however for people starting out I would suggest using a controller if it's available as it CAN allow for some better shots.Overall a fantastic game, definitely one I'm not giving up on anytime soon."

2,60.7,Recommended," August 7, 2015",105,"Rocket League is a well-made mix between racing and soccer genre. If you are subscribed to any of gaming Youtube channels or websites, you are probably already familiar with the game and you know that there is quite a lot of hype about it. And that hype is not unjustified.If this review is too long for you, I suggest you to only read the first paragraph about the game's content and the final verdict at the end.What is happening in the game:You are in control of a car and your mission is to score enough goals to win the match with other players. You can play multiplayer (with actual people) or singleplayer (with bots). Also, there is a freeplay mode for you to sharpen your skills.With practically no bad sides and tons of good stuff in this game, I certainly recommend it to everyone, not just fans of soccer or racing. I'm not a big fan of either of them, but I enjoy this game a great deal. You can customize your car in more than 10 billion combinations, the game really encourages you to play and the feeling when you play is amazing.This is certainly one of the best games released this year. There are so many people playing all the time, there are streams, Youtube videos, tons of discussions, simply amazing. You can't be sure how long is this going to last for, so try grabbing it as soon as it gets any discount or even now, as it is certainly worth the full 20$ price tag.Greetings,BirdCute"

I left the comfortable region in which a keeper should plant himself firmly. In the distance I saw my companions on the offensive, rushing back to help me in vain. It was in that moment that I saw it. I would very soon miss the ball and cause my team great pain.My thoughts were of all the other games, in those which I’ve made the very same mistake. Yet the desire to one day succeed was strong and I could not help myself to that leap. As the ball flew passed me, In that direction that I wished it not to. I felt as if death had gripped me.I’ve let my comrades down, failed them and taken a selfish action for a benefit that could only be my own. As the ball graciously embraced the deep fathoms of the net, I was met with the taunts and suggestions of my sexuality. I brushed them off, as a knight brush of the lives he takes in the battlefield.The strange thing is: That I would do it all over again, for one day I will fly through the air like a majestic winged shape, and one day I will hit that ball. My friends will cheer and my enemies will tremble, for thus my rank will be great."

1,388.2,Not Recommended," April 25, 2016",26,"I have to write a new review about Rocket League and it's current state and future which sounds pretty bad from my point of view. I know this review will get a massive load of thumbs down from fanboys but whatever.Rocket League started out as a great, fun game with a lot of potential. I gave it a positive review before because the game mechanics overall are great and it's fun to play even for hours on end.But Psyonix seemingly changed, from ""Let's do a fun game for everybody"" to ""E-Sports! Boxes! Trading! Microtransactions!"", a rather sad change. That Psyonix became greedy was obvious when they sold the ""complete Soundtrack"" which turned out to be not even half of the songs and after complaints they just dropped a Vol. 2 for the same price, which was just a rip-off.The ""E-Sport"" part (as asinine as it is to call video games ""sports"") was the next hit. Suddenly people complained. ""Wah, wah, wah this Wasteland map isn't completely flat, i don't wanna learn and adjust to this map"", ""Wah, wah, wah this Neo Tokyo map is retrarded, it's not completely flat and people with skill use the ramps to score"", ""Wah, wah, wah this Starbase Arc map is an Octagon, it's not like the other maps"". Basically people cried because they lacked the skill and the patience to learn the maps.Sadly, Psyonix, probably because of the ""E-Sports"" but also the crybabies decided to turn Neo Tokyo into yet another long, flat map and now they will turn Wasteland flat and remove Starbase Arc altogether from Competitive. Turning all maps into the same makes me wonder why they even design different maps. Just have the Champions Field in Competitive and done. But they even remove and change maps for casual and then say ""Oh, you still can use them by hosting your own game"". Yeah, thanks.Besides that, there's the Online component. Psyonix can't find a proper way to get matchmaking to work. Be it in casual or Competitive, you will play against noobs, you will play with noobs, you will play with people who dance circles around you. That's not fun.What's also not fun is that Psyonix seemingly doesn't care that people from Parts Unknown can change your european game. I had matches against people with Pings up over 900. They lagged so much they weren't even able to hit the ball and were easily defeated, which to me isn't fun. I had to play with people with pings over 300 who constantly crashed into me because they lagged behind. This isn't fun.And instead of fixing matchmaking or coming up with a solution, Psyonix rather releases game modes that instantly bomb. Hoops got quite some hype but now barely anybody plays it. Dropshot was played for 5 minutes and everybody just left. Both modes are dead novelties.And then come the Microtransactions. Crates with thankfully just cosmetic items but this lead to another problem: People now ""farm"" crates by being AFK in matches, even in Competitive or they spend more time writing ""Trade?"" in the chat, reminding me of beggars asking for change and they ignore the match around them because trading skins is so much more important or banning people seemingly for just speaking their mind on the chat which might get heated, but banning people is just downright idiotic. Apply if a word filter if you think some millennial snowflakes will cry if you tell them they play like braindead monkeys on crack (Notice: I never received a ban, i just read it a lot with example of what can get you banned and i can just shake my head. It's sad)Considering all that, it's no wonder that in August the average number of players dropped by 13.48% and this month so far sees another drop by -0.88%The game is still fun if you just play with your friends. Nothing wrong with that but the overall dumbing down and focus on ""E-Sports"" and Crates in my oppinion is a very bad move. It actually reminds me of Overkill and Payday 2: A game with potential that went down the drain because the developers rather added microtransactions and more useless DLC instead of fixing the problems the game has.So i can't really recommend it anymore to anybody."

Carball is all I know. ""In all seriousness...This game is ridiculously fun. Unlike a sports simulation where you simply press a button to pass or shoot, you're given total control over a Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle Car. You ram your vehicle into the ball to dribble, pass, and shoot. The concept is ludicrous and results in one of the best games I've personally ever played.At low levels, the game is slow paced as people become accustomed to the mechanics, but never does it cease to harbor massive levels of enjoyment. As the game opens up (from your skill and grasp of the controls), you'll start to see the game in a totally different way. Everywhere on (and above) the field is now open to play, and you can start creating teamplay opportunities you never thought possible. The game progressives like such throughout your time playing, and the skill ceiling is incredibly high (if not non-existant). I'll spare you my ranting, but regardless of winning, losing, or who I was playing with or against, it has always been a good time.On a different note, the game is almost nearly as amazing to watch as it is to play. The is the official Psyonix/Twitch partnered eSports event. Alongside the pro's, there is competition at nearly every level. The community is bright and active, and the devs are some of the most interactive and supportive creators I have ever seen in the game industry. Please take a chance, grab some friends, and give this game a try. It will be fun.

It's challenging and it will most likely rustle your jimmies once or twice.But the rustling aside, the game is also very relaxing in some parts. For most of the competitive games nowadays you are required sound to hear the enemies footsteps or information, not this game.

It's almost like its simplicity is its strength, with this environment where you can apparently only do one thing, you're able to do almost anything. It's almost got a sandbox feel to it, always competing but trying out new things, and I can safely say that after 1000 hours there's still so much to learn.Price wise is fantastic, and if you've got the funds available I can't recommend it above, don't be overwhelmed when you can't do what you want at the start, just give the game the couple of hundred hours it deserves and evaluate your situation then."

It's such a unique experience, and it's unfortunate that I never really took the time to play SARPBC. Apart from any game I have owned, it is a competitive multi-platform sports game that you will have copious amounts of fun playing -- Whether you're on the winning OR losing team.This game has seen a lot of negative feedback lately due to the crate system being introduced. Personally, I never really liked the idea of it, but do keep in mind, there is absolutely no Steam Community Market involved.Keys to unlock crates are $1.49, and the crates seem to drop fairly often. If nothing else, it's an OK way to fund further development of the game and increase prize pools for RLCS.Those of you that are just SO upset with Psyonix about crates, and threaten to uninstall-C'mon. We really got the best flavor of sh*t sandwich here, if sh*t has to be eaten.The animated decals and wheels are pretty darn sweet.Warning to all:Parts of the community and certain individuals that you will meet can be VERY toxic and degrading in online matches.That's pretty much the internet for you, but I feel that it stems from something more specific;A lot of CS:GO diehards play this on the side with their clanmates, and that kind of vindictive and immature mentality leaks in to this game due to the competitive nature.In closing..Bring some friends, keep your ballchasing to a minimum, and dive in to this game.Prepare for a wild learning curve and a boatload of fun."
325,99.0,Recommended," June 22, 2016",44,"OverviewRocket League is a very popular, iconic multi-platform game that doesn't do much, but it gets by formidably with the few it has. Speaking as someone not interested in either cars nor football (Yes, football. The real one!), this game is incredibly addictive, and worthwhile if you have a few friends to play with.The Pros:Incredibly Fun - Simple concept, easy to get the hang of but with a very high skill ceiling to keep you motivated in playing for a long time. Scoring some trick shot goals or plain luck bounces of the wall both fill the adrenaline in your soul. Winning is rewarding, and losing just makes you want a rematch.Great Visuals - The level of detail is pretty decent, and cranking up the settings at maximum really gives it a nice feel in terms of visuals. The car models are very detailed, weather effects are decent, and praise the Gods for the adjustable FoV!Despite the shortcomings, this game is incredibly fun. But do not purchase alone! Convince three friends to get it too and buy the 4-pack. Aside from better price, you will get a vastly superior experience when playing with people you know."

I still have much more to experience out of this game, so I may update the review as I go. As it stands, Rocket League is an incredibly fun indie racing-sports game.

Get this, get your friends to get this, join a party and play as a team. Just like actual football/soccer! With flying, exploding, spinning, rocket cars.I'm still working through the game's content. There's offline exhibition games, a Season mode, online play, and tutorials. I'm hoping for some really intense online bracket tournaments involving multiple teams, but so far I've only played regular online matches. There's also local split-screen play, and cross-play with PS4 players! As of right now, I feel like most players are PS4 online, because no one seems to use the chat at all.I have one small gripe, but it may just tie in to the server troubles mentioned above: the matchmaking could be better. The matchmaking system is competent when it first sets a game up, but if a player drops, it doesn't seem to try to bring new players in. If a whole team leaves after a match, sometimes it will hang on the matchmaking for so long, it's faster for your team to just quit that match and create a whole new match, with new matchmaking that works. But bear this workaround in mind, and you can avoid those waiting periods.Update Edit: Although there's no traditional dedicated server listings, you can setup Private Matches with just your buddies or what not. Retracted that comment from matchmaking gripes.Just pure, nonsensical, sporting good times to be had here. A must have unless you despise racing, or sports, but honestly, you might even find yourself having a good time then too.To think that I spent 2 years hyping over Batman: Arkham Knight, and that whole ♥♥♥♥♥torm goes down, and I have more fun with Rocket League in fifteen minutes than I probably ever will with that game.

As of right now, I feel like most players are PS4 online, because no one seems to use the chat at all.I have one small gripe, but it may just tie in to the server troubles mentioned above: the matchmaking could be better. The matchmaking system is competent when it first sets a game up, but if a player drops, it doesn't seem to try to bring new players in. If a whole team leaves after a match, sometimes it will hang on the matchmaking for so long, it's faster for your team to just quit that match and create a whole new match, with new matchmaking that works. But bear this workaround in mind, and you can avoid those waiting periods.Update Edit: Although there's no traditional dedicated server listings, you can setup Private Matches with just your buddies or what not. Retracted that comment from matchmaking gripes.Just pure, nonsensical, sporting good times to be had here. A must have unless you despise racing, or sports, but honestly, you might even find yourself having a good time then too.To think that I spent 2 years hyping over Batman: Arkham Knight, and that whole ♥♥♥♥♥torm goes down, and I have more fun with Rocket League in fifteen minutes than I probably ever will with that game.

I've never had this much instant fun in a game in a loooong time. I also don't think I've had this much adrenaline while playing a game ever.Absolutely amazing game design. Its extremely juicy; there are great effects and small touches that really, really add to the fun of the game. Everything you do feels satisfying and extremely responsive. Controls are very intuitive as well if you use a controller, such as Xbox or PS.So deceptively simple, yet so insanely fun. Not much depth on the outside, but once you play you realize that there is a lot of depth, and a LOT of potential.Easy to play, hard to master.Buy this game. Now."

5,832.7,Recommended," May 4, 2017",37,I'm new to Steam but I got to say; Rocket Leauge is a fun competitive game and is definitely one of my top 5 games to play daily. In my past 15 hrs playing I had no problems during game play and was exstatic to find out slpitscreen was available on pc. Another great thing is that its compatible with ps4 and XboxOne controllers which is an essental to my game play. there were no bugs or glitches during my game play but if anything comes up I'll post a new review.
150,9.8,Recommended, February 7,34,"The following review is based on the Linux versionThis game is obviously not for everyone. Why? It combines soccer with driving and RC cars! But suprisingly it's fun. The game offers several different gamemodes including a 3v3 competitive mode. There is a lot of options to customize your car (body model, skin, colour, engine sound, exhaust nitro effect etc..). The game is not easy but even casual players trying to relax after a tough day can enjoy the game because it's more focused on fun than try harding.There is also something incredibly interesting about this game - Rocket League supports cross platform multiplayer with PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch consoles - yes, multiplayer is compatible across Linux, Windows, Mac, Xbox One and PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch! Unfortunately PS4 players cannot play with Xbox One players (and vice versa) together yet (details here http://rocketleague.wikia.com/wiki/Cross-platform_play ) but the developers are working on it. In my opinion every game should be available on every platform and players of any platform should be able to play together, it's usually impossible but Rocket League is really close.System info & performance reportPlatform LinuxOperating system Arch Linux x64Desktop environment Gnome Shell 3.26API OpenGL"

266,75.9,Recommended," October 5, 2015",17,"Okay, okay. Yes, I still exist. I meant to post this review earlier but I couldn't due to some technical issues.Let me put this out here: I'm not a soccer fan. Probably because I'm an American (despite my name) but I just never got into it. I played it when I was three and quit before our first game, so I was never big on it. But then I was introduced to Rocket League. At first, I didn't care too much for it. Eventually, however, I soon realized I was missing out. When I was on the verge of buying it, my awesome friend Cyroden bought the game for me at the most convenient time. After playing it when I had my opportunities, I'm ready to give an opinion on it.GraphicsThe game is gorgeous. Very gorgeous at that. Compared to other ""sports"" games, this one stands out. Everything is incredibly detailed and is high quality compared to the other potatoes we've gotten in the past few years. Not to mention, this game comes with a replay feature, and with it, if used properly, you can make some incredible screenshots. I don't have any issues with anything here.This is the core of the game. If this is bad, then it's not worth buying the game. But I gave this game a thumbs-up, so you know what I'm going to say. Everything is very smooth and flopping around in a car is just flat out awesome. It's a simple concept but it has a learning curve that's quite time consuming to master. I would highly recommend a controller to ease the suffering a little bit, but it's not that necessary. It's still playable with the keyboard and mouse. Getting adjusted to the controls can take a bit of time, because I first mixed jumping and toggling the ball camera up, and it didn't turn out so well. Some of the controls do seem questionable, even after I converted to controller with this game. However, it isn't too rough and you should manage to get the hang of it within a couple of hours. Also, if you're a dude who loves creating stuff (like myself) then praise the devs of this game for adding a car editor here. There's also no pay-to-win techniques or anything here, you can get every single item in the game without spending a dime, and there's no way you can pay for the items anyway. Everything is unlockable, and the editor is simple to use. Would I add some more to it? Yes. But it's so rare to find any kind of simplistic editors these days I'm already thankful there's one in this game.There's no story, it's just a multiplayer game meant to be fun, this won't be counted towards the final score.This one is going to be short and sweet as it doesn't really matter all that much in this situation. The music fits and some of the tunes can be catchy, and the audio is pretty solid as well. There are no major flaws, but there's nothing to drool over here.Of course, this is the debatable one here. I didn't get hopelessly addicted to it, but I still really enjoy this game. My one problem, and it's probably the biggest issue I have with the game, is the fact that it seems heavily reliant on having friends play with you. I had friends to play this game, and when I played with them, it made a significant difference in the fun factor of the game. I would've played a lot more of this if it wasn't for the fact it's not as fun if you're playing alone. But, it does excel in the fact that it's a fun game to play with friends so I'd recommend trying to find some out in the wild.Rocket League is flat out fun. Yes, it's flawed, but it's still an excellent title to play if you've got some friends, a controller (preferably) and a free night where you've got nothing to do. Finally, a game that had a clean PC release and didn't try and drain your money!+Beautiful graphics+Smooth, simple gameplay with a solid learning curve+CAR EDITOR!+No cheap pay-to-win techniques+Acceptable audio...-...but it doesn't get any awards-Heavily reliant on having friends-Confusing controls at first"

What can I say, the game is worth it at full price PLUS DLC (I have most DLC -- 3 are needed to 100% achievements). This game is very easy to pick up and there are tons of skills to master the game -- from dribbling to advanced aerials -- if you want to play it competitively or just improve. Plus there are tons more to come with Rocket Labs introduced and there is a basketball mode in the making as I write this review :)---------Pros --Well...

Yes, please!This game is finely crafted multiplayer perfection (and the single player modes are great too), with the right touch of chaos to go along with skillful gameplay. Even when you mess up a great shot or send the ball flying into your own goal, you'll have a lot of fun doing it. I expect the skill ceiling for this game to be very, very high over time, but it's forgiving enough that even people who feel overwhelmed by other online games can have a lot of fun and contribute to the team.An absolute steal for the price - if you buy it, you'll keep playing, and playing, and playing....(In fact, what am I doing here?

Rocket Leauge is one of the most impressive games to come out in the last few years in my humble opinion. The replay value is nuts; you can keep playing almost indefinitely without getting bored. There is a pretty big learning curve but once you get the hang of things the rewards are great!This game is a soccer game but instead of sending troops into battle you send 3­4 cars into the arena! What could possibly make this better?! How about strapping rockets onto the back of your ride! There is a great deal of skill involved but even if you suck you will have tons of fun. I have worked my way from easy to hard on single player and I felt like my skills were pretty solid, winning most matches. I quickly realized though I’m still not that good; other players are always better and the difference in skill levels are vast! So don’t be discouraged when you start getting whooped on multiplayer!Overall, this is a real gem! Make sure you computer is strong enough for multiplayer because it will definitely use more resources. You can often find this game for about $15 now so lookout for that deal!"
2,13.0,Recommended," August 9, 2015",71,"Rocket League is a physics based football type game(no I will not call it soccer). It is actually a sequel to a game called Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars. Rocket League was released in early July 2015 on the PC and PlayStation 4.The gameplay is very simple, you control a rocket powered car and you use it to play a game of football. To many this may sound boring and unfun if you aren't a fan of either cars, or football - let me reassure you though, even if you aren't a fan, I guarantee you will have fun whilst playing Rocket League. The game is highly addictive and it will keep you playing until the early hours of the morning with that ""Just one more match"" feel to it.Rocket League has a single player mode, an online multiplayer mode and a local multiplayer mode. I haven't played the single player as the multiplayer is completely where the action is at. The match making system works flawlessly, you will not have any problems finding a game, as of right now there are over 20,000 people playing. Each match lasts 5 minutes, and can consist of teams of 1, 2, 3 or 4 people. Personally I enjoyed the more hectic type matches of 3 or 4. Another nice little bonus is that Rocket League also works cross-platform, meaning you could end up being in a match with PS4 players which is one of the first I've seen run this type of system.The controls are very simple, and you can pick them up in a matter of seconds.It is highly recommended that you play this game with a controller though, I have not heard any success stories of people using keyboard and mouse to play.Graphically, Rocket League is an awesome game to look at, just the right amount of lens flare, smooth animations and gorgeous looking backgrounds and arenas to play in. The game is ran using Unreal Engine 3, and it has been pushed to look stunning.I wouldn't exactly say Rocket League to be a difficult game, it has a very pick up and play vibe to it, but it will take you a couple of hours to become a real asset to your team mates, rather than just driving back and forth on the map chasing the ball.I have been playing Rocket League for almost six hours now, I am by no means a master at this game, and it feels as if I am only scratching the surface of the skill level you can reach. Like I said, this game is highly addictive, you will really struggle to put it down after you boot it up. The fast paced action and quick matches keep you on the edge of your seat the whole time.This game runs as smooth as a babies bottom, the 60 fps, high resolutions and customize-able graphics make this a really PC game that is highly worth your time.' We are looking at one of the games of the year right here.1) Stay away2) Only recommended when on sale3) Recommended4) Highly recommendedIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

1,"1,187.9",Recommended," November 6, 2015",14,"I can't even begin to give this game enough praise. Why?I start playing this game with the intent to only play an hour, and realize many hours later how long I've actually been playing. Whether I'm experiencing a bitter defeat, a glorious victory, or a five minute overtime bout I'm still having a blast. I yell, I shout, I pump my fist in hoorah for that aerial save I just made. And I still can't get enough of this game.Rocket League is a very well polished sportsy footballesque game where you drive cars and try to shoot the ball into the opposing teams goal. It's a simple concept but with all the moves and tricks your cars can perform there is suprising depth in how to play as an indvidual and as a team. You can perform all types of moves, you can do just about any type of roll or flip perceivable, single jumps, double jumps, and you can even fly with your boost. This is one of the few games that I've had this level of drive to master my play, and with two whole days of game time logged away I feel like I've really just mastered the basics and am just now scratching the surface on higher level play.I'm often a bit hestitant to jump into online games, especially ranked. I find ranked matches in general to be stressful and a little too adrenaline intensive, yet in Rocket League I've had nothing but a blast playing competitively even when I was as green as the turf I was driving on. I've never even hesitated to try new things in competitive games or to try and master aerial shots and other such techniques that are easy to screw up. In short, I've had a lot of fun playing this game and the drive to better my play has been a contributing factor to my enjoyment. Playing with a friend makes the game all the more enjoyable, being able to shout at each other over VOIP about each amazing shot we convert or each epic save we make makes an already exciting game all the more awesome.Bottom line. This game is FUN. It's just fun. You jump in, you find a match, you play, and you have fun. It's not overly complex, it doesn't add lots of un-needed features. It's straight up action packed fun.P.S. And of course, like any good driving game, you can customize your ride so you can kick butt in style."

But there is something which they cant fix and can make your experience one of the worst that you will ever have.What i am referring its to the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ community on this game,i swear i've never seen such a toxic community on my entire life,and i've played games like CS:GO,CoD and others. If you decide to play this game with people that you've never seen on your life,then im almost sure that in 5 matches that you play at least on 4 you will be trash talked by a 13yo kid who plays this game the entire day and likes to blame YOU for some mistakes.To be honest you cant enjoy this game for 15 minutes without being trash talked,you may think that ignoring might be the best fix for this,but after hearding words like ''Niger , Kys , You suck , EZ , WHAT A SAVE!'' for like 300 times you may think that ignoring isnt one option. I'm wondering why they don't ban people who behave this way to make the game better and enjoable,i really have to admit that sometimes i almost unistalled the game just because of those kids.Although i really recommend this game,but here goes some few tips,Disable the chat before matches,specially on competitive ones,just allow the chat for your teammate also be patient and try to dont get mad (even though i really think you wont resist for long after being trash talked by a 10yo kid) and the last tip,try to play this game with a friend,its going to be way better.

This is especially true when using a controller.The customisation options for the vehicles in this game are plentiful and really allow the player to stand out. Although, a small minor update to allow the painting of the wheels would be nice...A vast selection of options for private matches are available to change, meaning you can create some rather interesting matches at times.Overall, the game is great and can easily be played by almost anyone with 5 minutes of free time."

The game is simple to pick up but hard to master. After two years of consistent play I still find myself lacking in certain skills, which makes it all the more exciting when I pull off a sick tornado flick (can confirm they're harder than aerials on a keyboard). The game never fails to surprise.To say Rocket League has replay value is an understatement. I don't want to erase my memory to experience this game for the first time again, because playing it today is still just as good.

Yes, definitely, but if you struggle financially, wait for a sale, as is the case with all games.Should YOU buy it? ... If you like the idea and want to try it out, yes.

Long story short, it has been worth every penny, and is one of the most addictive games I have played in years.Pros- Perfect for study breaks since each match is only about 5 minutes. Read one chapter of your textbook... reward yourself with a match.- Simple and easy to play, but challenging to master. Figuring out how to hit the ball (especially in the air) is difficult at first, and there is a learning curve.- Great developers who have already announced free DLCs (along with extra paid cosmetic DLCs).- Optimized even for low-spec PCs.- Cross-platform with PS4.- There used to be a problem with people quitting midway through a ranked game with no penalty. However, now there is a 15 minute ban from matchmaking for leaving ranked games, so it is not as much an issue now.- Difficult to play without a controller, but still possible. I would recommend a controller if you buy this.- Occasional lag on servers (but hopefully will be resolved in the future).Overall, I would highly recommend this game. 10/10"

I'm not really a huge fan of sports games.But this........ this rules.Rocket League is one of the most addictively fun games I have ever played. The graphical presentation and flow of the animations is sharp, fluid and perfect, just like the control and response (regardless of whether you prefer keyboard/mouse or controller).The soundtrack selection is wonderful.The insane amount of unlockable content, combined with some really reasonably priced DLC adds to its replayability and sense of progression. Playing a new vehicle is like installing a brand new game.This game really puts you in a competitive state of mind. It's a type of intense that keeps you wanting to come back. Scoring asinine goals and making big saves and assists in Rocket League is one of the most satisfying experiences I've ever had the pleasure of having in a video game.Don't pass it up. It'll be your loss."

151,126.2,Recommended," July 9, 2015",15,"This is the first game I've ever felt inclined to give a review on. I have to say it's probably one of my favorite multiplayer experiences ever. NO LAG on online multiplayer, great graphics but still very well optimized, and a fun community that simply loves the game. I'm not one to choose these kinds of indie competitive games but the gameplay at least had me wanting to use it as a local multiplayer game (yes, it can have up to 4-way splitscreen). However, after playing one match online I ended up playing for a few hours straight.I highly reccomend this game. Since it is new, the player base is fairly large (about 40,000 in matchmaking from 11pm to 2am) it will surely give you hours upon hours back on your money.10/10 Will binge play this until my fingers bleed.P.S. I was playing this with a controller so I'm not sure how well the keyboard controls work for this."

Sounds stupid. But actually it's dynamic, tense and fun, especially in online play.You can unlock cars, decals, tires, painjobs, stuff like that, you can also play training, exibition, seasons and of course multiplayer. I have it on both PC and PS4 and I have to say, it's much easier to play with controller than keyboard.Anyway, yes, I would recommend this because it's pure fun!"

275,19.6,Recommended," July 24, 2016",88,"Release7th July 2015Genre(s)Racing, SportsDeveloperPsyonix, IncPublisherPsyonix, IncSingle-Player, Multiplayer, Co-OpA rather unique idea of cars and football (or soccer) together to create one of the best competitive games ever made. If you're someone like me, who doesn't like cars or football, you may be put off by this at first, but it's definitely not what it seems, it's no wonder it's so popular. Definitely worth it!Rocket League is a game where you drive around in a rocket powered car trying to score goals. Sounds boring doesn't it? It really isn't. Rocket League suprised me. It's not one of those generic sports games I was anticipating it to be. It's a really addicting and competitive game. The game is highly physics based, meaning you'll see cars jumping and flying around. Realistic!Your team can have up to at least 4 players, with matches lasting five minutes. The goal is basically what you do in football/soccer, score goals. The team with the most goals wins. This can be a challenge sometimes as it does require team-work, unless it's 1 v 1. There definitely isn't a shortage of players, with thousands of players on Steam AND it's cross platform capability with players from the PS4, which isn't really seen that much in games. Finding a game shouldn't be too difficult either, the matchmaking system's perfect.The game highly advises you to use a controller, except when I started playing, my controller stopped working, so I resorted to using the keyboard. Honestly, it wasn't that hard for me to adapt. It does take time, for some people, but after that the controls become pretty simple, though I would still recommend using a controller, as there are plenty of people who struggle with the keyboard and mouse.The game isn't just multiplayer, there is a single player and a co-op mode. In single player, you are able to access a mode called Season. This puts you with your own unique team, and places you in a tournament against bots. I haven't really played much of it but it seemed pretty simple. If you want the most out of your money I would stick to the multiplayer as it's much more entertaining and challenging.There are quite a few different maps in Rocket League. Each one looks amazing and colourful, with quite a bit of background detail which isn't a suprise due to it being made on Unreal Engine 3. Despite all the activity going on in the match, performance was never an issue. This game runs rather smooth for what it is.There are different types of cars, all of which are fully customizable, ranging from colours to patterns to wheels etc. You can unlock these different customizations from completing matches. Not to mention, there's plenty of dlc that add different cars and customization items, that have quite reasonable price tags.Rocket League is one of those games where you can loose track of time playing it, and I'm glad I replayed it after months of it sitting around in my library. It's highly addicting and I can see why it's so popular. It also has such an amazing soundtrack that plays in the background of the main menu, with some really memorable songs. If you have spare money, I'd definitely say this is worth it, a near flawless game. The DLC seems quite reasonable as well.- Highly addicting- Amazing detail- Highly customizable- Great performance- Amazing soundtrack- Problems with keyboard controlsIf you liked this review, be sure to give it a like! I'm still learning. :)Also be sure to follow my curator page here-And be sure to follow TeamTomReviews for more reviews like this! -Thanks for Reading!"

1,2.3,Recommended," July 11, 2015",7,"The great thing about the beautiful game is that it's a very basic concept: Get the ball into the goal. Video games have put various spins on that concept with great results, and Rocket League joins that list.You drive a car straight out of Speed Racer. It's got jump jacks and jet engines that you can actually use to fly for a brief period. It drives great. You can even drive along the wall. Drifting is as simple as holding down a button. Easy to use camera controls and UI elements make sure that you know where the ball is. The presentation is amazing and can get you hyped very easily. The game itself is simple to learn but with the boost system there are some very advanced techniques to figure out. Multiplayer supports 4-player splitscreen as well as 8-player online, even both at the same time. And if you're playing by your lonesome, the AI players can keep you company. Did I forget to mention this game also has crossplay with the PS4 version?Rocket League is excellent and I would highly recommend it to anyone who's enjoyed arcade-style sports games like NBA Jam or NHL 3-on-3 Arcade."

50,"1,768.0",Recommended," March 19, 2016",7,"Rocket League is one of those games that pop up every once in awhile and make a statement and a change. The simplicity of the game which the eye first meets, to the fine complexity of the game that is not first seen but learned through experience is what makes the game so great. When you first start out you may not realize you can even double jump or fly, yet the game is still so fun. Then you spend some time playing your judgement gets better and you learn to make moves effectively in order to be competitive. You then notice there is training and so on and so forth you start changing camera settings and button layouts so you can be as effective as possible. This game has so many layers to it. Iv noticed there's a really steep learning curve to this game and then you plateau for awhile. Then you kind of step your way up and up as you then notice you have a few hundred hours into the game and your still not bored. Iv never seen a game that can keep me so addicted to and yet it's such a simple idea. What makes it great to me is how there is no aid in shooting or blocking it's your rocket car against physics and gravity with your car as the force to change its directing. It is so satisfying to score a game winning goal or the game winning save for your team. Once you start playing with friends and communicating you realize how serious it gets. I can't think of anything that's bad about this game the work they are doing is great and now Xbox one is coming into the cross play making it one of if not the first games to allow PC, PS4, and XBOX ONE to play together. If you have not bought this game and I was one who looked over it a few times but still had it on the back of my mind it was one of those, oh if I have an extra $20 I'll buy it. NOOO if you have the money I don't care what your plan was with that $50 steam card this game is a must have and I'm sure every single rocket league player can say the same thing there's much more than to what meets the eye."

172,216.1,Recommended, March 30,16,"I think the central genius of Rocket League is that it compounds the accessibility + depth of soccer with the accessibility + depth of racing games. You can understand the game immediately upon seeing it, but it's totally fresh, and it supports a rich, infinite, and easily understood skill progression. It's one of those rare games that lives up to the ""a minute to learn, a lifetime to master"" mantra.As soon as you notice that the gameplay is just soccer, you can pick up a controller and immediately understand what you need to do. You can import everything you understand about the strategy and tactics of soccer and it maps quite well. You know what good performance looks like so you can easily evaluate your own play and visualize how to improve. People who have never played the game can quickly watch it and enjoy it socially. It's just so accessible on many dimensions.It doesn't have any of the video game ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that you would expect to see in a game like this. There are no weapons, or power ups, or god damned lore. The devs have actually pledged publicly that they will never corrupt the perfect, spare gameplay in future updates. It's so refreshing.It's hard to imagine how it could be any better, and the developers are clearly committed to nurturing the game, having already released new content only a few weeks after launch, and announcing a DLC with promises for more in the future."

I originally played it to take a break from other competitive games but now it's one of my main ranked games. It's so simple, easy to play but hard to master and I ♥♥♥♥ing love it!The good well it has plenty of options all the way from graphical down to camera settings. Keyboard and mouse is supported and so is controller. They even let you rebind every single button for the controller, no annoying presets. The game looks nice graphically nothing mind blowing but where it shines is the gameplay, the concept alone is amazing 3v3 with remote controlled cars playing soccer. There's also 2v2, 1v1 and extra modes like basketball, hockey etc. The cars are fully customizable things like paint, decals, rims, boosts, hell they go even crazier by letting you change the engine sound, goal explosions etc. The soundtrack is awesome even though it only plays in the main menu, it hypes you up to play one more match every single time. The game constantly rewards you with free items and if you don't like them you can trade 5 of them for a better item which is awesome! Even the downloadable content is great and I never add that to the list of good points.Now the bad there's not much to list honestly I'd say the crate system sucks mostly, while I like collecting things I just don't see the point in opening crates with keys when you can just trade people for the exact item you want. I suppose the big learning curve later on in the game wouldn't be everyone's cup of tea but it's there, you'll either love it or hate it. The game can get super repetitive too but what online game doesn't.Overall it's an amazing game there's something here for everyone, whether you're playing casual, competitive or collecting items you'll have a damn fun time doing it!"

530,914.1,Recommended," July 25, 2015",20,"Corner♥♥♥♥ing simulator 2015 for sureRocket League reviewI don't really enjoy playing football/racing games (or just any sports game in general), but for some reason when you blend the two together, you get a really fun game! I've honestly been doubtful to get this one, but don't have any regrets buying it - not even after playing it on and off for a good year.After first being introduced to it by watching E3, I told myself to keep this game in mind because I might want to buy it sometime in the (distant) future. A little bit later, checking out some twitch as usual, this game was just everywhere. So I watched some streams and I thoroughly enjoyed them. Much more than I had anticipated. So eventually I decided to just buy this game and give it a go. I have to say it's been long since I bought a game at full price, but it has been totally worth it.+ Gameplay is VERY enjoyable: intense, hilarious, chaotic and rageworthy+ Easy to learn, hard to master+ Tutorial + training areas!+ Matches are short (5 minutes), making it ideal for casual players also+ You don't need friends for this game, however I do recommend playing with them+ AI (computer controlled) cars are pretty decent+ Car customization!+ Game looks gorgeous+ Some nice catchy tunes that totally get you into the mood for some intense Racing/football+ It's best played with a controller, but mouse and keyboard do work fine too+ Price tag is about right- Fairly toxic community at times (hence why I recommend to play with friends)- AI cars (not always so decent)but all in all, a very enjoyable game. Whether you just want a quick 20 min break or a long 3- hour session, it's all up to you. One thing is for sure: you'll have fun. That is, if you don't take the game too seriously."
833,"1,319.1",Recommended," August 29, 2015",13,"TL;DR in the end of the review!Rocket League is the pure definition of a competitive video game: it's easy to learn and takes a lifetime to master.I need, however to adress one thing that will put MANY people off: and that is the mix of genres it seems to have, and that is its mix of football and driving...However:I have no hesitation in recommending this game at all, including for people that do not like racing, football or both, simply because it doesn't belong to any of such genresand as such, the problems you have with those genres/games, you simply won't have here.:as it clearly takes ideas from the Arena FPS genre, which is where Psyonix (the devs) got a name with their big hit Unreal Tournament 2004 (alongside Epic and DE).The devs could make a very plain car football game and that would be it. But they didn't do just that, did they?Well, ♥♥♥♥ NO!It will take you dozens of hours to master each technique properly and it helps that there is except in 2 clear aspects: hitboxes (The big Van-like car has a much shorter but taller hitbox than the Dominus muscle car) and drifts/handbrake use. I am using my XBOX360 controller () with customized controls to my liking, where B is the handbrake. With, for example, the Takumi or the Breakout, you can do 180's MUCH more easily than with the Van-like car (I don't know the name of the Van, because I actually don't use it at all :p).The graphics are absolutely excellent! Grass looks quite impressive, the bloom and shaders are stunning and give the game a very well needed sense of ""immersion"" that you are in an actual stadium!The game can run on pretty much any PC (granted, you may need to tweak it a bit on weaker PC's, of course) but when maxed out, it's a joy to both look at and play. There's AN FOV SLIDER!!!!! And many more camera options, graphics options are immense as well and can help you tweak the game to your liking (♥♥♥♥ motion blur).Audio consist of 2 big elements: Menu soundtrack and In-Game effects.Sound effects are good, but good only. The car engines sound quite ""meh"", but the ball exploding, the sounds the stadium produce when a goal is scored (which are, btw, all different: Every stadium has it's own sound props, which is a very welcome attention to detail) are all very well done. There are lots of different boost trace skins (which I'll adress later) and each make their own sounds, which is, AGAIN, a very nice and welcome attention to detail.Besides all the cool moves I listed above I must say the physics in this game are the best I've seen in, probably, ever! I am not even kidding...The game has the same mode (just score the most goals after 5 mins) but there are 4 playlists: 1v1 Duel, 2v2 Duos, 3v3 Standard and the 4v4 Chaos mode (and I can confirm it's chaotic as f*ck!).While there are no different modes... and there is space for a full 100% striker and a full-time 100% goalkeeper as well (even though it's not recommended: everyone needs to have a more mixed role, though a more attacking player and a more defensive player ARE CRUCIAL!) and 4v4 takes skill but I play it (as most probably do as well) just for the fun :D(like a basic nitrous skin, a flamethrower skin, purple smoke, blue data-streams, rainbows (my favorite :D), etc. etc.), (you can have cars made of carbon fiber, gloss, metal, etc., very GRID 2-esque, which I really like), overall:(timing is very crucial in any save/shot you take and most of all... power of antecipation... kinda like the Quake multiplayer... eh... see why I called it the Quake of sports now? Well there you go...).Oh and there's crossplatform play with PS4 players (which from my experience, most tend to suck)."

I wish I had played this when released already :), but better later than never :D. A game about cars flying mindlessly after a ball. I've played around 25h and still have so much to get better at lol, like doing high flying or wall jumps.I've been playing football and racing games for many times and this is different in a cool way. Lots of skin customizations for your cars, ranks, awesome OST and different game modes. Most enjoyable to play with friends <(^_^)>.The matchmaking sometimes adds pretty high ranked opponents.

172,17.1,Recommended," July 16, 2015",6,"First of all, im reviewing the single player ""seasons"" mode, as i have not played multiplayer.I was hesitant at first to buy this game, as an arcade style game for 20 dollars seemed like a bit too much, but i have to say, this game turned out to be much better than i thought.It runs smoothly with little to no lag, and the controls are smooth (Using a wired Xbox 360 Controller) and that is something that a game as chaotic as this one certainly needs.The customization options for your vehicle are very fun to play around with, and you can end up with some pretty crazy looking cars! And you unlock the items just by playing matches, which makes it very easy to get new items.The camera options are very convenient, Allowing you to change the FOV, Height, Angle, and distance of the camera.Now, for the actual game, the seasons mode is very fun and competitive, allowing you to pick from different teamates, and to choose how many cars are on the teams. 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, and 4v4 are the option. 4v4 is my favourite so far though, as it's rather chaotic.Possibly the best thing about seasons mode is that even by yourself you still get very competitive, and that's something that i dont think many games deliver on.The music is a bit garbled and im not sure whether or not its supposed to play all the time, as it usualy stops within a few secconds.Overall, for a game that was just released, it is very fun and i'd recommend it to everyone, whether they like sports or not. I think this game would be even more entertaining with friends, but i don't have any friends that own this game."

A physical retail version for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One began being distributed by 505 Games in June 2016.This game is really fun, it gives hours of fun with or without your friends, it varies in game modes such as football (soccer) basketball and ice hockey, my personal favourite has got to be soccer, you can spend hours perfecting your touch of the game, by improving ariel strikes, ground striking, goalkeeping, it's endless. It is filled with a great community which can make you a lot of new friends! Once you've gotten better and played a lot at perfecting your touch, you can play more competetive by playing ranked, it's like normal but obviously harder and more competetive.

35,969.5,Not Recommended," March 15, 2017",6,"The game is fun for awhile I guess. The thing is 90% of players are toxic. My least favorite part about Rocket League is it becomes unplayable once you hit high plat and all the way through diamond and let me explain why.Rocket Leagues MMS is based upon ""how good you are"" or that is how it supposed to be. But really it makes you climb all the way to grand champion. Which is a huge problem and once again here is why. High plat/diamond are absolutely crawling with smurfs. and every time you call one of them out on it every single one of them claims they came from console. Which I have a hard time believing. Maybe 3% of them came from console but for the most part they are just boosting people are something along those lines. Smurfs truly ruin the experience for high plat/diamond players. About 1/3 of my games I come across another player that is usually on the other team 80% of the time in a party boosting their buddy, and they have something like 12 hours in the game. Problems like this need to be fixed.So as an update I got myself to diamond 3 and there are still smurfs here, this game truly becomes unplayable at about high plat."
28,464.5,Recommended," November 22, 2017",6,"A game that easily grabs your interest and inspires you to improve and move up the ranks. Overall this game is worth the asking price and offers many hours of entertainment in return.Positives:1) Extremely immersive, very easy to lose track of time, worth the cost.2) Plenty of nice, polite online players and new friends to meet.3) Chat disabled for 2 seconds.4) Requires a legitimate set of in-game skills to play well, rewarding discipline and tacticians.5) Friendly Dev team who genuinely care about their community and game.6) Fair crate system and a good trading community. The game can be enjoyed with or without taking part. Equally spending money isn't a requirement for enjoyment of this feature provided you're a cunning trader.Negatives:1) Toxic, petty players exist online and are easy to come by (although I don't believe them to be the majorty).2) Some in-game severs can make playing very difficult.3) There some discrimatory players who single out female players regardless of what is happening in-game (winning, losing, playing well, playing poorly etc.) It happens to me around the same frequency as crate drops.4) The in-game reporting system could be heavily improved. The drop-down categories are relatively vague in comparison to the many issues players might face.5) I don't feel there's enough support to prevent trading scams on the official RL trading site. I haven't personally had any issues with scams but I see it happening a lot to people in the community.6) In ranked games, sometimes the team pairings make no sense rank or level wise leading to one-sided games and easy defeats.Overall the positives outweigh the negatives and although it can be frustrating when you come across any of the issues mentioned, that frustration doesn't compare to the energy of a solid game with two good teams going head to head. For that reason, I do not see myself leaving this game anytime soon."

This is my choice as game of the year.Enjoy!PS: When you're looking at the store page, you can't miss the DLCs being there, but don't start thinking about them as a stupid, greedy move made by the developers, the game is cheap, so are the DLCs, they just add cars (Every car is almost the same, they're totally balanced and equal), antennas, wheels, boost ""skins"", and other aesthetic stuff. They're not necessary in any way, but I'm buying them all to support the developers, and because they're worth the price."

As of a competitive game, it is obvious that you will have hundreds, if not thousands of hours invested in this game. It is easy to learn, however hard to master. If you are scared of the cars having advantages and disavantages, dont be worried: they are purely aesthetic and has no influence on gameplay. And it also combines the fact that its a great game, both for bringing your friends together for marathons of laughs and for marathons of competitiveness.]If i can describe it competitively i would say its like you are having shots of competitiveness and fun; it's games are only 5 minutes long (longer if eventually the team ties up and the game has to end with any of the teams scoring the tiebreaker) and are incredible tense and fast paced. You will find yourself amazed by some of the plays made here and the sense of physics is well ported onto here.There are its flaws, however: The game does bring a certain ammount of questions whether it has enough items to be unlocked or not, as you will find yourself unlocking all of the game's content in a matter of hours, there are some server issues from time to time (minimal most of the time though) and there is the issue of not being able to have car customizable slots, where you'll find yourself having to customize your car to scratch if you ever change its model; all things that can be fixed throughout the updates and the dev that I gained my trust on from the time i played this game.In general, its a great add-up to your library that will fill hours of your life, that, in my opinion, were not wasted on.9.5/10"

166,146.3,Recommended," May 27, 2017",16,"Rocket League is quite enjoyable when you're playing with someone who you know or are speaking to because you'll have a better chance at winning or changing tactics to win the game.The game's style/apperance is quite simple but elegant in a way that Psyonix manage to pull off.I'd rate the concept of the game a solid 10/10The artwork/design is a 8.5/10The Soundtrack is a 5/10 for me because I have the music muted, but I do like the soundtrack but prefer to listen to my own choice of music on Spotify while playing.The connection problems that occur sometimes are quite annoying because you could miss a shot and ruin the whole match (This is not my Internet - Sometimes you can be conncted to random servers such as SA resulting in high ping)Lastly the whole cross-platform thing is slightly weird because the Xbox playes cannot hear voice chat/read messages that PC users write. Which kind of makes it irrelivent to even have them playing sometimes.Rocket League is a reasonable 7/10 for me.I would reccomend Rocket League to anyone with a decent PC as the game is overall easy to run/play and affordable at a price that will not break the bank."
598,519.8,Recommended," October 14, 2016",16,"Rocket-controlled autos flipping through the air in Thunderdome-esque matches of fenced in range soccer sounds like the indiscernible ramblings of a psycho, yet it winds up being sufficiently insane to work. Psyonix's Rocket League, the follow up to Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars, finds imbecilic fun in pulling turbocharge-fronted flips in a baked good truck, and the white-knuckle framework in working with your social occasion to control the mammoth ball on offense and resistance. The smart and liquid ludicrousness of Rocket League wires into an authentic respectable time – paying little personality to servers that now and again work perfectly.The crucial mode puts two social events of three in obviously differing however execution unclear vehicles (however 1v1, 2v2, and 4v4 assortments exist) as they race here and there the pitch looking for after the class' greater than typical likeness a soccer ball. The goliath thing is, you don't have to know anything about driving diversions or soccer to play. The models are basic: drive really energetic around glorious, flickering, neon shaded fields and do bolster traps while trying to crush a never-endingly ricocheting ball into a misleadingly tight space.The heart of Rocket League lives in that thought unfathomable change. It's thanks in wide part to the utilization of what I would call ""material science in any case,"" where the laws of gravity and essentialness get a splendid climb to think about driving on the dividers and housetop, and unconventional mid-air heading changes that would condense the driver in this present reality. By the by, its astounding change is so arcadey and fulfilling that I reliably need to remind myself to pump the brakes or lay off the traps when an immediate push or pound will do.Furthermore, those traps are the principle surface-scratching look at Rocket League's layer of philosophy under the unmistakably tumultuous squashing of metal. Tapping your ricochet get places you unmistakable all around, where tapping it again with a course held plays out a somersault, barrel roll, or bike kick. It may sound clear – and truly, it is – yet timing a hit to interface with a speeding ball, and controlling the course you send it cruising, down to right edges, takes some expertise. There are genuine, uncommon levels of fulfillment to be tapped when you see an accessory sorting out a shot from the corner and read the condition, pummeling on the brakes to push the ""go"" into the objective with an impeccably masterminded barrel roll. It's electric.Outside of the enraged and inebriating gameplay, Rocket League has deficient couple of parts to substance out the experience. The player-advancement structure – where winning matches, performing in-redirection deeds, or doing anything truly, wins you encounter – opens to some degree stable of insane vehicles or therapeutic decals and embellishments.It's engaging to drive a truck wearing a sombrero, without question, however since there's in every way that really matters zero mechanical refinement between the dozen or so sportsters, trucks, exotics, a couple thought models and no shy of what one hardened yogurt truck (select to PS4 players), there's no certified estimation improvement that developments how you play a match. Recollecting that is all superbly sensible for a level multiplayer playing field, I would have expected to see every auto go on the qualities and insufficiencies determined by their certifiable accessories: wear autos as snappy however difficult to-handle strikers, trucks and vans as slower yet more grounded guardians, and the adjusted yet all around advantageous roamers some place in the inside. It appears like a missed chance to incorporate a more basic association with your cars in the parking spot, particularly when making a squad to play through a whole season.By the by, there is an other advancement twist found in comprehending how to utilize the shocking mechanical noteworthiness of Rocket League's different controls and whimsical material science. Whether that twist takes you through online focused or arranged matches, lovely showcases, up to four-player neighborhood obliging play on split-screen, or each of the 36 weeks of a completely widened season mode, the Rocket League experience is constantly about getting into the going with throttle-pumping match.Recalling there are leaderboards to track your bits of learning and general limit, Rocket League servers battle to bolster the converging of PlayStation 4 and PC players seeking after for same and cross-arrange matchmaking sessions, rendering the lion's share of Rocket League's online segments – including the online party structure – spotty, most perfect circumstance. Luckily, the AI is critical on either burden setting above Rookie, both as partners and adversaries, so Rocket League doesn't lose much in a totally separated proximity, which is uncommon, since its online suite is, in a manner of speaking, unsteady.Rocket League is a phenomenal circumstance where the execution of a key, over the top accepted is so solid along these lines beguiling that it needn't issue with a monstrous measure of additional parts around it. The surge of tearing over the pitch at full turbo to deny a shot on focus with a hold bike kick is sufficient to bring me back on different occasions for only ""one more match,"" even without basic improvement frameworks. Rocket League is a phenomenal, silly, simple to learn and hard to star development sports redirection which requests that you get a few sidekicks and play a few rounds.(All reviews are captured from the Internet and hustled through a royal ine of synonym tools three times both for laughing and to store time.

319,506.9,Recommended," February 26, 2017",30,"Product received for freeAfter 250 hours...Rocket League is a multiplayer game of angles and timing. The only difference here is that you use a car to hit a ball. Playing for a long time doesn't guarantee you becoming skilled, but you'll have a solid base and hopefully don't repeat the same mistakes you made when you first started playing it. Most people will let you know about it, using chat commands sarcastically or call you whatever swear words you can think of. I don't want people to be put off by this, cos it's something you can expect from any multiplayer game, but since the teams are smaller than in FPS games, you get a bigger whiff of the hatred thrown in your direction and the guilt from making a mistake is higher, cos most games are 2v2 or 3v3. Therefore your teammates also have a lower tolerance for mistakes, so get used to losing a teammate when you mess up, even with them risking a time penalty in competitive mode. 1v3 or 2v3 matches can build character or completely throw you off your game, but that's all that Rocket League has ever been, a game of skill, not a cutesy football game with cars.Recently they added a custom training mode, which was long overdue, cos personally I lack the imagination to grow as a player, so I need these new tutorials to get a sense of how all these tricks work and there's a lot of them. A few hundred hours ago I thought once I master aerials I will be set, but consistently executing well-timed aerials is the bare minimum of Rocket League and I can't even manage that most of the time. I swear I'm still making the same mistakes I made when I first started, cos one thing, I'm so used to using ball cam that I'm often missing shots on the ground and in the air as well. In a way, I've painted myself to a corner and I'm stuck in a limbo of ascending and descending between Prospect I and II in Solo Standard. I've actually regressed in my playstyle and stopped taking risks, which freezes your judgement and makes you prone to even more mistakes. No matter how much hatred or disappointment is expressed at your expense, never forget that the real goal here is to have fun.All this depressing stuff aside, Rocket League is incredibly fun, otherwise I wouldn't still be playing it. You always want to get better at it. If it weren't for the incredibly responsive and accurate controls, this would not have been the success that it is. Being focused enough to anticipate every move, the trajectory of the ball and to perfectly time your shot is the entire game."

This game screams fun regardless of if you've played 1 hour or 1000 hours. Even if you're losing, you find yourself having fun. And that's the mark of a seriously great game, in my eyes.Rocket League can be played casually or competitively, boasting both unranked and ranked queues.

3,5.4,Recommended," July 17, 2015",9,"Rocket League is a game by the studio that made the free-to-play game Nosgoth that punches far above its weight. It is easy to learn, with a pair of tutorials that can be completed in under ten minutes and is almost immediately fun. However, the addiction starts to set in when you push yourself to start mastering the game.Your first few matches will feel chaotic and hinging entirely on chance. As you acclimate to the controls and physics, you become more confident within the game world and find yourself capable of intentionally performing maneuvers. That becomes a turning point in the game and as you perfect these skills, there comes an incredible elation when you line a shot up -- probably with an assist from another driver -- and nail that in. All with determined calculation, rather than random luck.The modes and arenas have minor variants, but are consistent. It quickly becomes a game pitting carthletes against each other and nothing else. True tests of skill and reflex. There aren't really even any modifications that impact skill, either. All the adding trappings you unlock are cosmetic. The game has ranked and unranked multiplayer of different team sizes and single player with a season/tournament campaign. That's it. That's all it needs.My only negative experience has been with AI/Bots. They are uncannily talented and whether they're on your team or the opposition, they can ruin the game. When you are the only human on your team, there's no joy in absolutely trouncing the other team, because you know it's because of the unfair advantage the bots provided you. Perhaps this is better in the Ranked league, but in general play, there are a lot of people who just drop out, midgame. I do not know if these are occurring because of network issues in this overwhelmingly popular (and therefore still trying to ramp up server and network capacity) game or if they're just poor sports. Either way, having bots substitute is frustrating -- and they don't seem to do match-making for in-progress games, to substitute slots with real players.Back to the positives though -- and this is a big one. You will almost immediately be in awe at how glitzy and shiny the world looks. The game has a great art style and fantastic presentation. Slick and not quite realistic, but very high quality. And the world is smooth. High framerate with, in my experience, absolutely no hitching or lagging or anything else. The game is smooth as silk.I find this a surprise, because it seems like a game that by all rights should be a bit janky. It should come with caveats and ""for the price point"" justifications. It doesn't, though. It's an excellent experience that feels well-crafted. It sets a framework for itself and stays within it, polishing what it does well rather than expanding endlessly upon it, poorly.If the trailer and live streams make this game seem appealing to you, I'd advice picking it up even at the $20 USD price. As long as the playerbase is still there when there is a big sale, that sale is going to be a no-brainer. If this game is found for $10 USD over the next few months, through the holidays -- it is going to be a downright steal. There is so much fun to be had here. Even more so, if you have a couple friends to build a team with.This is a total gem that I have no reservations about recommending.If you want to see some gameplay starting from the first time the game is launched, the following is a six hour live stream of Rocket League (begins about 5m into the video):"

Next comes Semi-pro, in this pool you start to get a feel and learn to see where the ball is flying and position yourself accordingly. At Pro you're on your way, this is where the community opens up and stratergies become more meta and kick offs take some priority. Veteran feels like you're being thrown in teh deep end because higher tier Veterans have advanced onto flying with that car and Aerials become the go to plan of attack.

Occasionally ther servers are overloaded or lack some players so you get to be the big fish and splash around with lower tier players while the game finds some players more suited.Constant DLC is a awesome bonus, and new Mutator gamemodes make for an awesome custom mode with friends.Overall a decent game, whether you're a PS4 Casual to a Competitive Player it suites all."

You have to create the pass yourself, and it can be anything, from a hard bounce off the back wall to a soft lob over the defender.Passing, shooting, dribbling, tackles, jukes, they're all in the game, but you have to make them happen yourself, not just press the right button.

I just don't like being on other people's time and sitting in lobbies. I'd rather play singleplayer these days. But Rocket League brought me back into the fold. You're rarely waiting on other people. You can drop in to most modes within seconds and games are merely five minutes of clock time and pauses for goals. Its simple, quick, doesn't waste your time. I enjoy that. Not to mention the game itself is fun fun fun! And there is a subpar singleplayer even.I was indoctrinated with the standard ""soccer"" modes of 3v3 but as I plateau'd and didn't develop into a competitive player I branched out into the less popular modes and matchups. There's plenty here to keep people of all skill levels, shapes, and sizes happy. E-Sports level competitiveness with the ability to join with your friends right down to what I'm doing casually bouncing into 2 or 3 ""Rumble"" matches with strangers when I got the time. Rocket League did something else for me too. The PC has a barren desert in the sports genre and this mildly and subtly fills the void a little more.They're also consistently adding new free content and updates. All the while keeping paid DLC cosmetic. I could care less about all the knick-knacks as I don't even decorate my car but its got all that item customization people like. Wheels, paints, decals, toppers(hats), etc. They even added a crate system for those so inclined. Full price might be a little steep now that they do indeed have all these other avenues of revenue but that's what sales are for and I'd recommend waiting for one. Recommended!"

1,"1,348.8",Recommended," January 21, 2017",12,"Rocket league is a soccer game played with RC cars. Obviously, the goal is to get the ball into the opponents net. Cars are given a few abilities to mix up the game. They can easily scale and drive on walls, and even up side down on the roof for a period of time (or longer with enough turbo). Boost or turbo is another feature in game. To acquire turbo, players must drive over small hot spots spread throughout the terrain. Some hot spots give minor turbo boosts while others will fill up the gauge all the way. Boosts when timed correctly, can produce a power hit on the ball. Some boosts when held down for a certain amount of time engage in some sort of ultra speed. When going this fast and if a player is in your way, you have the ability to literally run through and destroy the opponent.I am a huge fan of games which feature double jump, and rocket league has it! The first jump is a bit of a slow jump, while the second provides for another boost upwards, forwards, to the side or in reverse. While in the air, the player has quite a bit of flexibility to move about. This trick comes in hand when attempting to defend or attempting to knock the ball in an awkward angle. It can look pretty cool when done right. There are no power-ups within the games so this fact alone may turn a few people away from the game... this is only of course if you play competitive. Non-competitive games feature power-ups. None the less, the devs took a simplistic approach to keep the game engaging. The matchmaking that is available is organized very neatly and local co-op is an extremely appreciated feature. Matchmaking is a bit funny to me in the sense where if only four players are available, it will add two AI's instead of allowing for a 2v2 vote. Again, it's not a big deal as empty slots are filled up with AI's (sometimes extremely annoying AI's that score on themselves). This however only applies in non-competitive mode which for the most part is ok. A neat feature is there is an arrow that indicates where the ball is off screen. Additionally, there is a circle marker on the ball to show where and how far up in the air is the ball. Players can press Y to change the camera view off the car and toward the ball. The player can also choose to toggle the lock button for the camera.Graphics are well done and nothing seems cut short. You can optimize for performance or quality (whoot whoot)! There are different stages in the game but they are limited (or I should say were limited). A few more ""out of this world"" stages have been added for free which is greatly appreciated. The customizations regarding the cars are absolutely well done. From custom paint jobs, custom wheels, to even custom hats (that for some weird reason keep your goal count). My only complaint if I can have one is the DLC purchases for new car skins... but hey, who am I to judge. The menu's and the UI was also well done and everything is kept simple and neat. The music and sounds in game have improved since it's start. I love how different boosts all have a different sound and some even play music. This is really paying attention to detail. The sound tracks in general are pretty catchy. That could be part in fact I've also heard them numerous times.The game is quite exciting and cars seemingly fly everywhere. It's enjoyable when everyone crashes into the ball, but it is even more delightful when people start calculating hits and play positions.For future Rocket League DLC's or games, it would be nice to see some mini-games! The main part of the game is excellent, but imagine adding some modifications to it. Perhaps adding power-ups could give an alternative to matchmaking.Overall good game, and I would recommend it to most people. There are a few friends that are reluctant to get into it, but for the most part it has received positive reception.***Dec 2016 update : there are new game modes that involve other sports such as hockey or basket ball. I think this is a neat step as it creates many new opportunities. They are not available in competitive mode, but are still very fun to play. You're essentially a flying projectile whenever you wish. When you get the hang of flying, this game's opportunities start flying wide open. Very simplistic game but you can definitely see the skill range of some players is phenomenal. Unlike FIFA where you would get discouraged, I'm sure you'll start challenging yourself when you see some of these crayz stunts.And my personal advice is to get the dlcs because they are pretty helpful !Happy gaming ~~RATING : 9/10"

Three hours later, you’ll find time for another match. Rocket League is a fantastic multiplayer game with simple mechanics and a tremendous learning curve. It is easy to play and hard to master. You drive a rocket car and hit a ball into a goal. On a basic level it requires timing hits, simple passing, and good positioning. More advanced techniques include aerials, dribbling and pinching. Hitting goals is satisfying but you are always searching for that perfect match with good cooperation. With many skills to master, it is a game that provides reward after many hours. While there is some luck involved, such as when balls are contested, skill usually wins out. Rocket League is a game of exceptional value and you only need 5 spare minutes."

703,538.4,Recommended," October 14, 2015",8,"Detailed Review by AshesSummaryRocket League is a multiplayer soccer game with rocket cars instead of human players developed by Psyonix and a sequel to Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars. It includes a range of different cars, arenas, cosmetics and gets constant updates which add new content, tweaks and bug fixes.Cars and all the different unlockables are purely cosmetic and make absolutely no difference in gameplay, all of the new arenas are free which means the community does not get divided when new ones come out. The currently released paid dlc packs are simply cosmetic items and do not change gameplay or give any advantages to the buyers beside bragging rights.One thing that I like a fair lot is that there are no gimmicks and no unlockable advantages. Everything you have in Rocket League, you have from the beginning itself and the only important factor is your skill. This is how competitive games should be made. Nothing makes a player who has more hours superior to you except his skill, it's plain and simple.Rocket League is fairly easy to learn, but oh god is it hard to master. You can drive around, use your boost, jump, propel your car into the air with the boost, launch your car forward or in any other major direction and one often overlooked feature is the ability to spin your car around in mid air.There are several match types: 1v1, 2v2, 3v3 and 4v4. Each of them excluding the 4v4 have ranked versions if you feel extra competitive. When a match starts you spawn at one of several possible locations on the arena and the ball spawns at the center. Both teams rush to the ball for the first hit. Like in traditional football there is one goal on each side of the field and the objective is to score into the enemy team's goal while protecting your own. Scattered through the arena are boost fill-ups which can be picked up from both sides of the field regardless of your team.In terms of competitiveness Rocket League nails it, the complete lack of perks and upgrades make the outcome of matches rely purely on your skill and a hint of luck every now and then. Gameplay is exceptionally fun and enjoyable, you'll probably spend your first few matches hopelessly driving around the field not even touching the ball, but after a while you'll eventually get the hang of it and learn when to go for the ball, when to strike and how to position yourself among a lot of other things. As silly as the concept of rocket car football might sound, Rocket League is a very competitive game which even managed to secure its position as an electronic sport.The way a match progresses is fairly simple and much like real life football. After every goal the players and ball reset and both teams rush towards the ball for the first hit much like in the beginning of the game. If you end up tying a match overtime takes place and the first team to score wins. Overtime doesn't have any sort of time limit so a match can go on until your fingers fall off and your eyes melt.Matches are a team based effort and while it may be easy to win one of them in lower ranks without being a team player you will find that without proper communication and strategy you cannot win in the higher ranks. This brings me to another point, one particularly frustrating thing is that players can abandon matches without any form of punishment and to make matters even worse when a player leaves a ranked match no new player can connect in his/her place, which makes you are stuck with a bot. A system that punishes people for leaving games would be very welcome.There are 5 different arenas and each of them has its own theme and some have different variations, but note that they do not affect gameplay whatsoever, but instead offer a nice and welcome change of scenery. All of them have a lot of detail and provide you with loads of eye candy.Different cars offer completely cosmetic changes and so do car customization options. There is a total of 14 cars including the dlc ones so far and more than a few hats, wheel types, boost effects etc., the only thing lacking variety are the decals. Unfortunately there are only 5 decals per car and the game doesn't let you move them around your car or re-size them in any way, but you can change their color.Rocket League is absolutely gorgeous offering a lot of detail in both graphical and sound quality. The game is so detailed that you can literally see each individual piece of grass on the field. The soundtrack is perfect for a sports game like this and the sound effects are absolutely nailed. There are a lot of small details everywhere and if you have a powerful enough PC to max this game out you will surely be astonished by its graphical beauty.A very small, but nice little detail I've noticed is that each type of boost effect has its own different sound effect. Every time a goal is scored the ball explodes in a mixture of paint and fireworks and lets out a very satisfying explosion sound. As much as I try I can't find anything to complain about regarding the graphics and sound of this game.Rocket League is very well optimized, has no fps lock and a constant reliable framerate, a full PC interface and it supports gamepads, it has more than enough graphical, sound and game options. You can fully rebind your keys with both keyboards and controllers. I have to warn people with weaker or/and older systems that it might be difficult for them to run the game even at lower settings because it's pretty demanding.Everything you'd expect to be included in a game like this already is. We have cross-platform play with PlayStation users as well as split screen co-op on PC. After playing this for a fair bit of time, I even think that the PC version was simultaneously developed with the PS4 one instead of being ported, correct me if I'm wrong.All bugs and problems usually get fixed withing a span of several days and the game is constantly supported by the devs. One of my only problems with Rocket League is its servers. Sometimes, despite having really low ping I get disconnected or start lagging all over the place. This can be especially frustrating in ranked matches where losing can lower the rank you've worked so hard to reach.I've enjoyed all of my time playing this. It was incredibly fun to play with random people online, but even more fun with my friends. Gameplay is spot on, PC version is amazing and probably better than the console one, every feature I would want is implemented and the whole thing is just beautiful.This sort of purely skill-based gameplay is what more competitive games should be. No perks, no nuttin'. Just you and your team against the opposing team. Matches are short and intense and there is no big learning curve which means the game is really easy to get into for newcomers.I recommend this to anyone. If you are just looking for something casual and fun you'll definitely like it and if you are looking for something competitive and hard to master you're just bound to love it."

1,77.1,Recommended," October 22, 2015",6,"An Amazing Sports GamePeople have plenty of misconceptions about this game. Its not simply soccer with cars.Rocket League is an adrenaline-pumping, itch-feeding, finger-mashing, explosive sports game. It is the result of a great clusterball of imagination, vision and execution. You control a car, with rocket boosts that allow you to manouver in the air, jump and perform bicycle kicks. Unlike regular football fields, you are playing in a specially designed cages that allow you free movement. Since the fields are closed, the action runs seamlessly.The biggest difference that derails from the old formula of sports game is the fact that you only control a single entity. You do not switch from one ragdoll to another to perform incredible feats. You communicate with one-another on an electric level that when executed perfectly sends chill down your spine.With insane avatars capable of withstanding the severest laws of gravity, the presence of each individual in the field matter. Not once or twice, the game countlessly put you in exhilarating situations akin to football strikers: preventing a tiebreaker from being scored during the last moments of the round or giving an impossible sommersault pass with the last sliver of nitros that leads to an impressive aerial goal by your teammate.Instead of placing features that exist in today's meta, Rocket League opted for a more traditional approach. You will find no such character progression, career mode or ability unlocks in this game. What will keep you playing will simply be the charm of performing stunning moves, outmanouvering and outsmarting your opponents over and over again, one game after another.It's just another 5 minutes after all...+ Wonderful aesthetics/colour palette+ Amazing Soundtracks+ Ability to practice while queueing- Server Issues- Matchmaking problemsUpdated 2016."

22,"2,615.0",Recommended," September 10, 2016",6,"The 10 players you meet in Rocket League :The Defeatist :The match begins and boom! Within thirty seconds a goal is scored and your team is down 0-1. That's when one player on your team decides it's all over. The lead is insurmountable, the tide is irreversible, the team is unsalvageable. The Defeatist immediately abandons the match to continue the restless search for a team that won't let them down the way you just did.The Spoiler :You've just made an amazing, epic save. The ball was 90% inside your goal, glowing like a white dwarf and about to explode, but you somehow manage to bop it out just in the nick of time. And there's The Spoiler, the player on the other team just parked there, three feet away, who simply nudges it back in for a goal, utterly erasing your heroics.The Archivist :Sometimes you want to watch replays, sometimes you don't. Everyone feels that way except for The Archivist, who never, ever chooses to skip the replays even though they're not even featured in them. Even though everyone else has voted to skip it and get back to playing. C'mon, dude! I accidentally scored on my own goal and don't want to relive it. Press skip! Press skip!The Hitman :While most players focus on the ball, some focus on the other players. The Hitman doesn't just demolish other cars when the opportunity presents itself but makes it a personal mission to ram, batter, and destroy you from the opening seconds to the final klaxon. Not a bad strategy, really. If you're hit by this player more than once you'll probably give up on the ball and spend the match looking for a little payback.The Failed Stuntman :We all know the ball spends about half its time rolling up the side of the arena, and those skilled enough can chase it and make plays while vertical. The Failed Stuntman thinks the same thing, but is entirely wrong. They'll constantly chase ball up and down the wall and never once connect. Just wait for it to land, willya? You're not doing any good up there.The Only Player On Your Team :The ball has been centered and you're in the perfect position to knock it in for a score. But what's this? A teammate flies in backwards, knocking it away from you, off the wall, and back into midfield. It's The Only Player On Your Team, and this driver never, ever stops going for the ball, no matter where it is or who else might be going for it at the same time. As far as this driver is concerned, there's only one player on your team, and it's not you.The Doorman's Ghost :Praise be to the players who don't always try to score but hang back and protect your team's net. Occasionally a driver will actually spend the entire game playing goalie, which is great! Except for The Doorman's Ghost, who waits patiently between your uprights until the other team takes a shot on goal. At which point he's suddenly somewhere else.The Benedict Arnold :We've all done it, either by an ill-timed boost or an attempted save or just bad luck: we've all scored on our own goal. The proper behavior in this instance is to spend the rest of the match feverishly trying to make up for it, but not so for the Benedict Arnold. After scoring on their team they'll vanish in a puff of shame, too embarrassed to even attempt redemption.The Drunken Angel :Aerial skills are both important and rare, and most players won't risk it unless they're lined up perfectly or are desperate for a goal. Except for The Drunken Angel, who rockets into the air the second the ball is off the ground despite never once successfully making a play. In fact, even when the ball isn't in the air, this player is. Some drivers just like to fly.The Holdout :You've just had a fun, amazing, hard-fought match with fantastic plays, epic saves, and stunning goals that came down to a lengthy and memorable overtime. Everyone agrees immediately that another game is absolutely necessary. Except for The Holdout, who refuses to ready up. But why? We shared something beautiful! We'll never find each other again! Please, ready up! Ready up before it's too—the Toxic :The reason we use the word 'toxic' is very intentional.In our observations and research on player behavior, we find that a single source of negative behavior can ripple through hundreds or thousands of games. For example, let's say we have a game with 6 players--5 are positive, and 1 is negative. The 1 negative player is racist, rages all game, and intentionally leaves the game. This experience can negatively influence some of the other 5 positive players in the game. Some of these 6 players will play another game of Rocket League and instead of being positive, they might start the game neutral or negative. Their actions can then influence 6 other players in the game, and toxicity spreads.A single negative action could result in thousands of games with negative incidences--this is why many of our latest experiments focus on shielding players from toxicity (Restricted Chat Mode -- forcing players to make a decision between using limited chat resources for cooperative communication, or still using it for negative purposes and being message capped), or stemming the spread of toxicity (our next experiment)."

It’s as unique as it is fun, even to those who aren’t that much into sports game, like Borba.Replayability - Online gameplay, ranked play, regular updates and a ridiculous amount of unlockable cosmetics allow this game to last as long as the player wishes and has fun with it, and that may range from a few dozen of hours to the several hundred. The game can also be played offline and supports split-screen play.Rocket League is a title fitting for any gamer’s collection as it is an excellent party game that will live on forever through local play. It will most likely stay popular for many months to come, and Psyonix updates with new unlockables and purchasable cars on a regular basis. The gameplay is fun, the performance is great and it may even run on certain low-end machines."

550,384.6,Recommended," July 18, 2015",6,"No more than two minutes (maybe even one) since you opened the game and you're already looking at the ball, waiting for the countdown to finish, your little radio-controlled engine revving up, not knowing what your opponent will try, not knowing if your teammates are aware of what YOU will try. The countdown is over and two cars (or four, or six, or eight) lunge at the ball, all those colored and crazy boost trails converging at the center, a single thump, a mess of antennae, cars flying all over the place, the ball going up and away and everyone scrambles to send it to the opponent's side of the field. You zig-zag around, you and your team hitting your best shots, the opponent hitting their best saves, until finally a small mistake and you score. Or get scored.The replay kicks in, you relax a bit and realize something: It's been 15 seconds since the game started.Nostalgic in its simplicity, more than modern in its presentation, Rocket League is like Fifa Street meets Re-Volt with extra rockets. A game that wants you to get in and get flying as soon as possible and keeps you playing not with shady design decisions but with pure and fast competitive action. An amazing reminder that sometimes less is much better. Worth the full price or even more if you ask me.Oh, and last but not least: hats for your cars."

I said NO.The next day he asked me again to install the game. Again, I said NO. For the next two months or so he kept on asking me to install the game on a daily basis to no avail and I began to dislike the game even more because of that.One night I had literaly nothing to do, so I decided to install Rocket League but not to give it a chance but for my friend to stop asking me to. After the brief tutorial I lost track of time and realised I had been playing for about two hours. At the same time, my friend bought a Four Pack and shared the copies with some of our friends; at the blink of an eye we were all hooked into the game.In less than a week, 25 of us (and growing) already have the game and fell addicted harder than with heroin to the point of keep on playing for 7 continuous hours:YouTube™ Video: Choripán Squad [CHSQ] Live Stream - Saturday Night Rocket League Marathon - Addictive gameplay.- Lots of fun.- Easy to play.- Keyboard n' mouse playable.- Colorful visuals.- Great music.- Several game modes either online or local.- Powered by Unreal Engine.- Cross platform: you can play with friends that are in either PS4 or PC.- ""Mutators"": you can change the behavior of several things.- Highly suggested to play with your friends.- Lots of fun/sarcastic/senseless customizations.- Just a few stadiums to choose from.- Most of the cars' aesthetics look like they were designed by a toddler.- You can only choose from two team colors (orange or blue) when playing closed/private matches.- DLC's are somewhat irrelevant unless you really wish those extra cars and soundtrack, otherwise, get the base game."

Ready up before it's too—the Toxic :The reason we use the word 'toxic' is very intentional.In our observations and research on player behavior, we find that a single source of negative behavior can ripple through hundreds or thousands of games. For example, let's say we have a game with 6 players--5 are positive, and 1 is negative. The 1 negative player is racist, rages all game, and intentionally leaves the game. This experience can negatively influence some of the other 5 positive players in the game. Some of these 6 players will play another game of Rocket League and instead of being positive, they might start the game neutral or negative. Their actions can then influence 6 other players in the game, and toxicity spreads.A single negative action could result in thousands of games with negative incidences--this is why many of our latest experiments focus on shielding players from toxicity (Restricted Chat Mode -- forcing players to make a decision between using limited chat resources for cooperative communication, or still using it for negative purposes and being message capped), or stemming the spread of toxicity (our next experiment)."

3,29.6,Recommended," April 22, 2016",6,"TL:DR at the end, scored 9 / 10 as of 22nd April 2016Borba RecommendsBorba likes:Genre - A mash-up of different genres, Rocket League combines elements of racing and soccer to produce a physics based vehicle soccer game, heavily inspired on the same company’s PS3 exclusive Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars. It’s as unique as it is fun, even to those who aren’t that much into sports game, like Borba.Rocket League is a title fitting for any gamer’s collection as it is an excellent party game that will live on forever through local play. It will most likely stay popular for many months to come, and Psyonix updates with new unlockables and purchasable cars on a regular basis. The gameplay is fun, the performance is great and it may even run on certain low-end machines."

188,650.1,Not Recommended," August 5, 2016",6,"Okay let me be honest here, the game is amazing, the gameplay is perfect and it is very competitive. The developers keep adding great features and follow feedback, but I will still downvote this game due to its community.I have never ever seen such a toxic community, even counter-strike has a more helpful and supportive one. The people here are extremely harassing and ruin the experience of the game completely. I'm sorry psyonix, but please have that harassement report button do something."
1,118.3,Recommended," January 2, 2016",6,"When released, I marked the game as ""Not Interested"" almost instantly because I don't dig neither soccer nor racing games that much.Then, I bought a Steam Controller when it became available through the Steam Store, thus, I received a copy of Rocket League (along Portal 2) but I didn't bothered at all and soon I forgot about.One of my Steam friends noticed my Rocket League in his Steam Activity feed and asked me to install the game. I said NO.The next day he asked me again to install the game. Again, I said NO. For the next two months or so he kept on asking me to install the game on a daily basis to no avail and I began to dislike the game even more because of that.One night I had literaly nothing to do, so I decided to install Rocket League but not to give it a chance but for my friend to stop asking me to. After the brief tutorial I lost track of time and realised I had been playing for about two hours. At the same time, my friend bought a Four Pack and shared the copies with some of our friends; at the blink of an eye we were all hooked into the game.In less than a week, 25 of us (and growing) already have the game and fell addicted harder than with heroin to the point of keep on playing for 7 continuous hours:- Addictive gameplay.- Lots of fun.- Easy to play.- Keyboard n' mouse playable.- Colorful visuals.- Great music.- Several game modes either online or local.- Powered by Unreal Engine.- Cross platform: you can play with friends that are in either PS4 or PC.- ""Mutators"": you can change the behavior of several things.- Highly suggested to play with your friends.- Lots of fun/sarcastic/senseless customizations.- Just a few stadiums to choose from.- Most of the cars' aesthetics look like they were designed by a toddler.- You can only choose from two team colors (orange or blue) when playing closed/private matches.- DLC's are somewhat irrelevant unless you really wish those extra cars and soundtrack, otherwise, get the base game."

The game has a indepth tutorial to get you started off on your all-star career, and the game even offers a season mode which will rank you against other players. The game runs well, and looks as it should. If you're thinking of picking up this game with friends, do it. You will truly love it."

There still seems to be issues with proper display of ranking.Previous Review:[Recent 1.43 Update is terrible.Went from a very polished game to a laggy mess. I've never had an issue with lag prior to this update with ethernet connection to router, do now! 3 straight lag-filled games and other players are complaining via in-game text chat about the lag.Also, lots of visually distracting UI changes (nameplates, scoreboard) when IMO nothing was broken. The new crowd noise is distracting. Feels like my camera settings changed as well.WHY U BREAK GAME PSYONIX?!]"
86,68.8,Not Recommended, April 16,6,"RL is an absolute joy to play. There is so much skill and teamwork required to win your matches that you'll be getting better and better for atleast the first 100 hours of gaming. There are some tough matches that will keep you fighting through every second of the game and coming out on top is a real cause for a celebration.The game is fun, the level of talent varies exponentially from player to player and team to team. The replay ability never ceases. Good strategy and communication is essential. The banter is unmatched in any other game I have played.However, Psyonix have a pretty warped punishment system regarding the use of offensive language and will straight up Ban you just for name calling or using certain words; regardless of connotations. The bans themselves are pretty pitiful; they wait until you have logged off and don't begin until you next load the game up. And the more bans you get, the longer the time period you're banned for, starting with 24hrs and then to 72hrs. And people take advantage of this. There are ban baters and sad, pathetic little report cultists who will report you for any slight aggreviance, even if they have instagated the commotion by either leaving ratty comments or playing like clowns. I.E Camping in the goal and when you complain about them not even defending, tell you to shut up and play. They'll wait for anything bannable, screenshot and report. And Psyonix goes well out of their way to deal with such verminous scum as me by being snide♥♥♥♥♥♥♥who just want to brainwash me into being some gormless polite sort who just says 'EZ' over and over and over again, just to stay on the safeside.What they should be doing is muting players.. if anything at all... but they are these petty little snakes who actually enforce the witless cretins with no humour by lashing out rediculous bans in a really cringeworthy way. And for that, despite being a great game, they can shove it up their arses like they probably have actually done a thousand times before and ♥♥♥♥ off if they think they're even remotely ♥♥♥♥ing sterling. Also, loot crates are gambling so this game should be 18+ so they are a bunch of child abusing hypocrytes. ♥♥♥♥♥!"

Poem by: Josh and ValenteAs an American, the only way a game of footy is entertaining to me is if it's played a few middle aged fat blokes in Toyota Yarises. Thankfully, there is someone out there who is a whiz programmer that has put together a game that entertains people like me and I am sure a few ""football"" fans as well. Rocket League is built upon simple mechanics that are easy to pick up but difficult to master. Jumps, boosts and wallrides can be strung together into insane acrobatics that foist the ball into the net. You can customize the aesthetics of your ride by putting in time and unlocking goodies and competative online play make this a title you will come back to over and over. It's insane to think it has taken so long for a satifying vehicle based soccer game to pop up here on steam."

It can be genuinely hard to put down. It harks back to simpler times, when video games didn’t need a billion bells and whistles to keep players interested.

Flip and fly anywhere you like, do it sideways, backwards, upside-down.I love this game, though the only downside is that the ranked system is incredibly difficult to progress through without a teammate. Players are all consistently given unfair team balances and if you play lone doubles, being against two players in the same party is common, as well as being matched against players with significantly higher levels (thus more experience) than you. Oh well, I guess that's the reason I keep trying and the reason I keep trying to get better.Overall, 10/10"

It's also pretty good for local multiplayer as it has splitscreen functionality. It's often on sale for 13 or less and you really don't need the dlc so I def recommend if you even think you may like it.

122,"1,615.8",Recommended," November 25, 2016",4,"Well, usually I'm not the biggest writer - actually I haven't written a review at all. But when a game lets me pass the mark of 1,000 playing hours, I think it well deservers my first one.Rocket League is a fascinating and exciting mixture of soccer, but with a special twist of not just being yet another simulation, but it introduced something else - flying cars. It is rather easy to start with, and in the beginning (and to be honest sometimes even now) you are happy when you hit the ball. Later on, when you've managed to advance through the game with your first goal (yeah!), your first aerial-goal (hell yeah!!) and nail-biting saves of balls that have crossed the line with 99% (holy s***!!!) you will realize: ""Hey, there are still guys out there that kick my a**!"" and that there is still much to learn.But your effort and endurance will be rewarded with a fun, thrilling and competitive game, which will let you keep saying ""just 5 more minutes""...But that's not all: Psyonix, the developer, is one of its kind. They do something, which is rare, maybe even extinct in the world of game developers and publishers: they listen to the community (crazy, right?)!So here we are, a good year after the release of Rocket League and Psyonix has released several small (optional!) DLCs which primarily introduced new cars and they have released free updates which introduced new maps and play modes. After ice hockey and basketball which altered the map setting and/or the ball the newest addition ""Rumble"" gave us a more fun oriented mode with all kinds of power-ups that will literally kick your and your opponents a**. These big additions were free, so if you want to, you can have an awesome game that'll entertain you for ages at a low-budget price. If you want to support this great bunch of people a bit more, you can buy the DLCs or some keys to the recently integrated crates. Both ways are not in any kind a ""pay2win"" upgrade, but either just new cars or some stuff to pimp the visuals of your car.So with Rocket League and its DLCs being on sale again right now, wait no longer, and buy this great piece of software - you will not regret it!"

It is great fun with friends, and the self-improvement aspect within the game is what has me hooked. The need to get better and better, not just winning. Have spent hours in practice not just online games.I'm personally not a huge fan of Football, my main reason for buying this game was because it looked cool. Good content on YouTube and the eSports scene got me hyped for getting into the game, and once I got into the game it just sucked me into it. Hours worth of enjoyment for a small price, worth it for anyone who likes having fun and big + if you like competitive games and can invest time in improving your own skills."

Flip and fly anywhere you like, do it sideways, backwards, upside-down.I love this game, though the only downside is that the ranked system is incredibly difficult to progress through without a teammate. Players are all consistently given unfair team balances and if you play lone doubles, being against two players in the same party is common, as well as being matched against players with significantly higher levels (thus more experience) than you. Oh well, I guess that's the reason I keep trying and the reason I keep trying to get better.Overall, 10/10"

122,4.3,Recommended," November 23, 2017",4,"It’s fun to drive a truck wearing a sombrero, sure, but because there’s little or no mechanical difference between the dozen or so sportsters, trucks, exotics, a few concept models and at least one ice cream truck, there’s no actual sense of progression that changes how you play a match.sport cars as speedy but hard-to-handle strikers, trucks and vans as slower but stronger defenders, and the balanced but all-purpose roamers somewhere in between. It seems like a missed opportunity to add a more meaningful connection to your cars in the garage, especially when making a squad to play through an entire season."
461,391.8,Recommended," December 22, 2015",4,"For something as simple as soccer/football played with turbo-powered cars, Rocket League is way more in-depth and entertaining than it might appear on the surface. Fast-paced, clean-looking, and hard not to enjoy even when you're losing or making embarrassing mistakes, this game will give you plenty of moments where you're geeking out over some incredible shot, save, or block - and it will give you just as many moments of intense, stress-inducing close calls or just-barely-missed opportunities.Played like a much smaller (player-wise) version of soccer/football - with several variations like 1 vs 1, 3 vs 3 (the standard), 4 vs 4, etc. - Rocket League is an interesting mix of competitive sports and driving/racing, pitting players against each other on two teams in five minute matches. An interesting twist, however, is the rocket-powered aspect of the cars and the ""boost"" fuel that players have to pick up and manage throughout the match. While it might seem like something strictly used for speed, it plays into essentially every aspect of the game, from controlling yourself in the air to making/blocking shots as well as to take other players out. With both resource management and getting a feel for how the cars control or the ball works, the game can feel very random and chaotic at first, often leaving you feeling like any play you make is chance or luck; to me, however, this is where Rocket League's longevity and replayability really comes into play.You might be clueless initially and have no idea what you're doing (yet still manage to make plays), but the game unfolds more and more as you play and get your bearings. While one match you're barely struggling to hit the ball in the air, soon enough you'll hit them every time and come to find that as you practice you have way more control over the game and yourself than the chaotic atmosphere might let on. The high-flying bounces, the impossible-to-save/strike shots - it all will eventually be something you can not only handle consistently, but also open you up to the other techniques in the game like aerial movement/shots and boost control.Combine the solid gameplay and skill progression with an easy-to-use interface and good soundtrack (which should totally have an option to enable during matches!) and Rocket League is a surprisingly fun, easy-to-play but hard-to-master game that's both something you can pick up every now and then as well as play for hours."

287,700.3,Recommended," November 25, 2016",4,"!!!WARNING! SHILL MODE ENGAGED!!! (it really reads like a paid shill review...)Rocket League is an amazing game and if I have to be honest, probably the best multiplayer experience I have ever had. Bold claim indeed, but I can't think of a time when I haven't invested atleast up to 10 hours per week on it.Rocket League's gameplay on the surface is as simple and clear as it can get. You have a symmetrical field, two teams with 1-4 players on each side and a ball. Kick the ball into the enemies goal to win and that's the only objective. Literally RC car football. But once you get used to the bare mechanics of the game, Rocket League starts to unfold its brilliance. Not before long you'll end up denying boost spots so that your enemy can't get the valuable boosts, crashing into enemies to make them go boom or kick the goalie away, rotating your car midair to hit the ball precisely into a specific direction and changing/rotating positions with your team in order to keep your goal guarded and to lay pressure on the enemies one. The game allows for very strategic play and feels truly awarding when you end up victorious in a close match that went into +10min overtime against an equally skilled enemy team.Rocket League offers a good amount of playlists and game modes. Casual modes for some fun time after a long day, Competitive modes where the game will rank you according to your skill and even Hockey/Basketball/Rumble mode to change it up from time to time. I think that the ranking system as of now (Nov 2016) works really well and manages to keep me motivated, striving for better rankings (Grand Champion, here I come). Hockey and Basketball modes aren't very populated though and it can take a minute or longer to find people.Servers work fine for the most part, however you'll occasionally experience rubberbanding and lag which can be excessive, even in Competitive mode which can sour your experience. These issues however I have mostly encountered in Casual modes.Rocket League offers a sizeable amount of customization options for your car, from different chassis to wheels, colours, flags, decals and boost trails. It allows for some really funny and great looking vehicles and the recently added crates offer another big pool of content to work with. My only complaint is that decals aren't universal except for a few and the colour pallete isn't as big as I hoped for.Technically, Rocket League shines. The game is not a benchmark title per se, but it runs extremely smooth with no spikes whatsoever and offers a good amount of graphical options. I couldn't test performance with other cards myself (mine is a GTX980 - game runs up to 270FPS) but my friend has issues running it on a 310m on low settings(+30 FPS, Aquadome and Neo Tokyo are unplayable) so people with such low hardware should consider this before purchase.The visual style is very colorful and crisp. Rocket League doesn't suffer from visibility issues (it used to when cars exploded but it has been fixed since) and screen shake can be disabled (which I recommend). You can switch between two types of cameras: One that shows you everything right ahead of your car and ""Ballcam"" which tracks ball movement. Second option can be confusing at first but it is essential to learn using it, which after a while becomes second nature once you have developed good spatial awareness. Big plus: the camera can also be customized to your liking.I have never played a Multiplayer game that was this much fun and addictive. I highly recommend it to everyone who is looking for a fun and competitively viable game.If you excuse me, I've got to pwn some noo...*gets hit by teammate*AAAAAIIIIIIMPOOOOOOT!!!"

876,836.5,Recommended," September 30, 2015",4,"This game makes soccer (football) extremely fun due to being a car with rockets. You will learn to control your car to hit the ball in various angles. Then you will jump and hit the ball and using your second jump (or dodge depending on direction) to navigate the battlefield or hit the ball harder. Then you will learn the beautiful art of rocket ballet as you use your boost to fly for short periods of time while scoring goals. Mix all those elements with teamwork for a simple, yet extremely complex game filled with sick plays, amazing comebacks, and did he just score a goal flying backwards? What!?Forget FIFA. Play Rocket League.I should now mention that their post-launch support has been nothing short of amazing. I don't agree with their decision to include gambling boxes for cosmetics (I prefer to buy things directly), but the amount of free content and excellent modes has been substantial. Rumble has been one of the best modes they've added to the game. The other bonus modes have their own followings too. Some people just play Hockey League exclusively.Rocket League has incredibly fun gameplay and is backed by a great developer. I just hope they avoid becoming a money hungry monster, but they've been doing a splendid job so far.They've added a training mode where you can create playlists of different shots for scoring or defending. This is the best addition to the game since Rumble and is incredibly fun to play. I enjoy both making and experiencing what others have created."

In spite of having a high skill ceiling, it is very fun at every skill level. 1v1's are very exciting to measure up individual skills and mind tricks, 2v2s and 3v3s are awesome to team up with your friends (and even randoms), 4v4s are waaay too crazy for my taste but can also be fun.The newest update included mutators, and they are hilarious to play with friends.Everything is well done, the gameplay, the graphics, and the mechanics. Even the DLC is well done; they're just cosmetic, they're cool, and they're cheap (Back to the Future DLC).The developer keeps the game updated with free maps, cosmetic stuff and game modes too.My only complaint is that it should have a custom training mode, where you can move the ball launcher around, disable goal replay, disable infinite boost, etc...This will be my favorite game for quite some time for sure."

It's a great game that will keep you occupied for any amount of time you allow.They have consistently added new content for free and new cars as paid DLCs. I really enjoy the underwater maps that they recently added and the resemblence to rapture from Bioshock (one of my favorite game series). My favorite DLC car is the Delorian Time Machine.On a different note, I'm not sure about the new addition of crates and purchasable keys to open said crates. However, it seems to be fine because none of the items you can get in a crate will give you an advantage because of their purely cosmetic nature."

There's a significant rise in the esports aspect of the game too, don't be surprised for this to become a strong contender on the big esports scene.The game is really cheap compared to other big titles. there're optional cosmetic DLC which you can get to support the game even if further if you so wish and there's frequent updates with lots of free content! What's not to love about Rocket League?!"
469,542.0,Recommended," November 25, 2016",4,"Soccer/Football with cars -- so what is the big deal? This well polished game has several appealing aspects. For starters, the games last about five minutes so you can jump in for a quick one. Matching is mostly based on skill level so you often are paired against fair competition. The game includes training modes and allows you to play computer opponents so you aren't thrown in the fire right away. The most significant charm, though, is the craziness. You have cars ramming each other and balls taking lucky bounces. You have small mistakes causing a teammate to miss an easy goal. Or a teammate accidentally knocking a ball into your own goal. In other words, this game is easy to learn but difficult to master all the nuances and moves in the game just like real soccer.Whatever the formula for gaming fun is, it seems like Psyonix has figured it out."

261,21.9,Recommended," August 29, 2016",4,"-Quick Review-Rocket League is a Racing-(?)-Sport-Game developed by Psyonix, Inc. and released in 2015. But if you've ever seen or heard about this game, you know it's not ""racing"" in a true sense of the word. You're playing sports with a car and a HUGEEEEE ball/Puck/Cube/etc.Cube Action... Apature would be proud - Uploaded for the review A Screenshot of Rocket LeagueBy: Atratzu-Detailed breakdown review-Story: Atratzu has no story for the game, you're a car playing sports, sometimes the audience is balls, I could write up something clever about a thermonuclear exchange which resulted in sentient cars and balls, but instead I will share personal stories while playing the game.So lets get a bit personal, first you should know my old bias: I've always held the perspective that I'm bad at racing and driving games, I didn't start realizing how to drive in video games until it was out of necessity from games like Mafia 2 *cough cough cough*.Okay, so you know a bit of my backstory and that I didn't really play games like these. Fast forward to July 2015, I'm chatting on Discord and a group of friends ask if I want to play Rocket League. So I mumble ""I don't have the game"". *PLOP* Eqval gifts me the game, so I download and play it that evening....Never did I expect what happened when I started playing this game. Something inside my clicked I actually really got into the game. Don't get me wrong: I'm not good at Rocket League, that's for sure. I'm pretty terrible at it. But I somehow got into game... the closest thing I can think to describe it is... you know those Over Exaggerated YouTuber Lets-players? Yeah, that was me that night.I went to bed exhausted from screaming, even my pet birds were like ""what was that all about? Sheesh, some of us are trying to sleep over here, jerk.""You control a vehicle, which you smash into a ball to move the ball towards the other team's goal. We've got our good ol friend WASD controls: W to accelerate, S to go reverse, D to turn right, A to turn left. Why did I just explain how WASD works? Because reasons, I don't know, I dumb things down by default.If you've got your WASD down, lets move on to more advanced controls: Right Mouse button to Jump because that's realistic, Left mouse button to Boost because rockets, Shift to power slide because I'm bad at Mario Kart too - thank God there aren't any motion controls! You also use the Space Bar to have the camera focus on the ball. If you're used to the space bar being jump this will confuse you to no end, as you're screaming at the top of your lungs that you ""CAN'T FIND THE FREAKING BALL, WHERE IT IS???"" and you're off looking at a wall, or upside down on the ceiling, because chaos.Normally this is where I mention that I don't have a controller, and originally I was going to take a jab at controller-based-gamer, but Rocket League really is better with a controller. The problem is controllers can actually move around the camera. I can look forward, and hit space to toggle between the ball and forward.I had to bind my mouse X and Y axis to the camera, but that didn't work so I rebound them to my Arrow keys and that's inconvenient. My mouse wasn't bound in the first place because any mouse movement will send the camera shaking like a scared bunny rabbit.Long story short: the controls are better with a controller, but the game is still playable with a keyboard and mouse. I went into the settings and adjusted the camera distance to compensate for my controls slightly.Moving on to customization: there are tons of different settings to make custom games, your cars are very customizable (A word I use often in my reviews, but spell check insists is not actually a thing), having cross platform multiplayer is pretty nice too, without it I wouldn't have been able to play with two of our Discord friends! (They're Platform Gamers, we should all pause for a collective ""awwww"" for their poor souls {I'm probably going to get crap for that comment since I'm linking them to this review after I post it... *scratches back of head*})There is a type of ""quick play"", but you need to Que up. You choose the type of game you want to play and the number of player (min: 1v1 max: 4v4). It's important to note that rare unlocks are only available in online games, rather then private exhibition matches. Seeing as most of my time spent playing Rocket League is in private games... I don't have many of the cool things, but that's okay, it's still been worth it in my opinion.At the time of this review, there are competitive seasons to play. I'm definitely not the right person to talk about competitive seasons. I generally give them a few shots to test the waters but that's about all I can and will say about Rocket League competitive seasons.In the best interest of the consumer, I poked around with all the singe player content I could find This is what you can do on your own: The starting tutorial, Practice/Free-drive-Mode, Practice Drills, and Exhibition (Single player, customizable, private game.To break it down a bit: The starting tutorial is what it sounds like... once you start rocket league for the first time you will be guided through the basic controls and tactics for Rocket League. There is an advanced version of this tutorial that will cover some of the less known tricks, I IMPLORE you to play the tutorial, this is one of the most helpful and least painful tutorials I've ever played in a game.FreePlay/Practice/Free-drive-Mode, I didn't really use this much but people who spend a great deal in rocket league do, early on I drove around the empty lonely field and practiced making goals, but I didn't feel like I was actually improving, just getting the hang of the controls.There are three Practice Drills; Goalie, Striker and Aerial, Just like with the starting tutorial, the drills were extremely useful and informative. In addition to acting as a score board to see how much better you are then your friends, you have three different difficulties for the drills.Lastly, and my most favorite features: Exhibition. Exhibition can be used to play Single player against bots of different difficulties, on any map or game type of your choosing, and customizable rules.I know, I know, I said in an announcement in my steam curator group that I was shifting my attention away from achievements, but this is worth while knowledge for achievement hunters and 100% completionists: You cannot earn 100% without DLC, and you must competite in the Rocket League season, depending on how well you do, you might be forced to play for several seasons to unlock all of your achievements.There's loads of DLC which you can purchase for additional cars, or aesthetics for your cars. It's DLC what do you want from me, I'm not so interested in it, but for some people they can't live without their NBA car flag. *shrugs*WHEW! I had way more to say about rocket league then I expected going into this review, and this is just the written format... I hope to revisit this game on my youtube channel with a video review.TL;DR, I've enjoyed playing Rocket League , it's extremely fun with friends, it can be played on your own, it can be played single player, but it by far exceeds at being a ""party game"", there's a high skill cap so people can get insanely good if enough time is plugged into it.As always, thank you for taking the time to read my review!"

436,47.9,Recommended," September 24, 2015",4,"Rocket League;In this little gem of a game you're in control of a car...these cars have rocket boosters on the back of them. Your goal is to play soccer/football. You can do 1v1, 2v2, 3v3 or even 4v4. There is also a ranking system if you're the competitive type. The matches are usually quick which makes it really easy to get addicted to this game meaning you'll be hitting play again over and over. The average match length is 5-7 minutes. (Could be longer if you go into overtime) In those few minutes you and your teammates need to try to score as many goals as you possibly can while trying to keep the other team from scoring. Another great thing about this game is that the cars that you use to play are customizable. You unlock flags, hats, wheels, body styles, paint and all sorts of other things to make your car the way you want. There is ALWAYS people playing so you definitely don't have to worry about not having people to play with. It is cross-platform which means you're also up against people on PS4. Honestly I would recommend playing with an Xbox controller if you have one (its easier for me personally) Most of the time on average there's about 50-60,000 people online at any given time.Since the first time I wrote this review there has been a few DLC added to Steam for purchase for this game. They're definitely worth it, along with Rocket League itself. Make sure to pick up this game for you and your friends, you won't regret it.Pros:-Quick Games-Amazing Graphics (Your potato can run it at max settings)-Customization-Steep Learning CurveCons:-You'll Be Playing With Balls....Tons and Tons of Balls. ;)-Keyboard Controls Take a While to Get Used toFinal Verdict;10/10"

2,3.1,Recommended," September 15, 2015",18,"What's in a Name?Naming sequels should be a straight forward process shouldn't it?You can use the same name of the original and just slap a number on the end (or if you're going for ""Artsy"" a roman numeral for extra gravitas).Sometimes people try to overcomplicate things unnecessarily which annoys me.I can get on board with the whole, Alien, Aliens, Alien3 thing,I've even made my peace with the Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 10 fiasco(Did they make a Windows 9? and was it so bad they had to lock it in the attic to hide it from the neighbours and feed it fish heads in a bucket when no one's looking?)Anyway some naming systems for sequels defy logic, SimCity, SimCity 2000, SimCity 3000, SimCity 4 then back to SimCity again... that's just crazy!It's either SimCity 5 or SimCity 5000.Have a little consistency people!(not that is really matters, SimCity 5 was crappy anyway).What's in a Name II ?But there are exceptions where I can forgive a sequel for not carrying the burden of its ancestors name.For instance, do you remember a game called ""Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars?""Me neither and as such I'd be unlikely to show much interest in a title called ""Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars 2""(Even typing a title as long of that makes me sad).However a game I have been playing recently (and thoroughly enjoying) has been the snappily titled ""Rocket League"" which the Steam store page confidently tells me is the sequel to the previously mentioned (and ridiculously named) battle-cars game.So as I said, had Rocket League been released as ""Blah, Blah, Blah-Blah Blah-Cars 2"" I'm convinced I would have avoided the title and missed out on a gem!But thankfully it wasn't and I didn't so here we are now!Rocket League is a deceptively simple arcade, car racing and football (or soccer to our American friends) mash-up.As a side note, I've never understood why American Football is called ""Football"", they play the ball with their hands right? so is it called football because handball was already taken?Also, because the label ""football"" is (rightly or wrongly) used for a game played with your hands it results in a sport which is actually played with foot and ball being called ""soccer"".... it's not important but it does boggle my little mind.Anyway... back to Rocket League.The Football part of the mash up is a simplified version of ""the beautiful game"".Each match takes place in a caged stadium so there's no need to worry about the ball going out of play, there are no corners or throw-ins, no fouls or offside rules, it's ""soccer"" boiled down to its purest form.As you'd expect, there's a goal at each end of the pitch and one giant♥♥♥♥♥ball (it's bigger than the cars!) that you need to knock around the field.Each match only lasts for 5 minutes but with most of the interruptions that slow down a regular footy match removed it makes for a frantic, adrenaline fuelled 5 minutes of non-stop action.There are different stadiums to choose from too, you can even pick up more by way of DLC to keep the background looking fresh if you feel the need.The driving side of the mash-up is where Rocket League really shines.Gone are the egoistical, under-educated but overpaid human players that ""show-boat"" around the pitch during a ""real"" football match, here we have cars, gorgeous, acrobatic rocket powered cars!Winning games will unlock a whole wealth of upgrades and adornments for your vehicle too.There are hats, flags, wheels, decals, you can even change the colour of the smoke that spews out the back when you fire up your rockets and hurtle across the arena.These customisation options are a huge amount of fun and give your chosen vehicle an element of individuality when you're playing (and if you're as talentless as myself, losing) against your peers online.Maybe those go faster stripes really will make a difference in the next match... (I need all the help I can get!)As a football simulation Rocket League is a great driving game.The handling of the various vehicles is surprisingly good and complimented by a very intuitive set of controls.You'll need to dust off your game pad to get the most out of Rocket League, but it's totally worth it!It's rare that I play a game where the controls feel so dialled in and natural.It doesn't take long before you're hitting the controls without thought to make the car jump, flip and spin on command, of course doing this in the right location to make the ball go where you want is another matter.""Easy to learn, hard to master"" are six words that definitely apply to Rocket League.The game itself is fantastic to play, you can choose between intimate 1v1 matches all the way up to the mayhem you'll experience in a chaotic 5v5 match.With a little (or maybe a lot) of practice you'll find yourself sliding and skidding your vehicle into position to intercept, pass and shoot the ball.It's a great feeling when you manage to pull off an impressive move (whether accidental or not) and leaping your car into the air to nudge a high flying ball into your opponents goal is soooo satisfying, especially in an online match when you've got a real audience to admire you car-ball prowess.There's a tutorial and single player mode too which are both vital if you want to learn the ropes before you take your newly fledged ""tyre-ball"" talents online.If I could give you some advice to avoid annoying others and embarrassing yourself when you first fire up Rocket League it would be this:""Practice before you start playing online!""(Hey, that's six words again, spooky!)So we know the game plays well, but what are the aesthetics like?Well, the arenas are all beautiful and provide a pretty backdrop which you'll probably hardly notice as you zoom around the pitch.The vehicles themselves are bright and varied with some neat customisation options (although I'm sad to say that ""go-faster stripes"" did not make me a better player).The sound is of a high standard too, from the roar of the engines to the roar of the crowd, the atmosphere created by the audio gives the game an energy and intensity which heightens the whole experience.Rocket League looks and sounds great!(yes, I'm doing the six words thing on purpose now.)But can I sum rocket league up in six words?hmmm...Well there are cars battling to win the ball, let's call them battle-cars, they're rocket powered, maybe even supersonic and they are definitely acrobatic....Maybe something like""Supersonic Rocket Powered Acrobatic Battle Cars...""although that does sound familiar...It'd be a great name for a game though...Wouldn't it?Whatever you want to call it, Rocket League is a polished, intuitive and extremely addictive alternative sports title.I'm having a blast with it!But remember, if you do come and join the fun (and you should) and if you encounter a player online with an unprecedented lack of skill (and go-faster stripes), take it easy on them...It might be me!For the full review (and others) please take the time to visit"

550,86.0,Recommended," February 6, 2016",9,"Rocket League is pretty cool, I guess.Set in a post apocalyptic future where prisoners are forced to play soccer in highly explosive motor vehicles, where the loss of life and blood shed is used to sate the anger of an ever growing complacent society. Rocket League puts you in the shoes of one of these vehicles as you do your best to try and put that stupid god damn ball into the stupid god damn net if only your god damn team would stop charging at the god damn ball like you're part of a god damn peewee soccer team.God damn.Never has a game made me feel as inadequate as Rocket League, it's like living in a box while Tommy Two Tooth lives in a relatively clean dumpster. I want that dumpster, Tommy.The game can be played with anything from two to eight people, who's objective is to hit the giant ball into the giant net. This is easier said than done half the time since you have 6 or 8 people charging into the ball with the hope of it somehow finding the net. I mean, I'm guilty of this two, but I have the excuse of being ripped on MDMA for most of my life.Sounds simple, right? Well, it is, but it also mixes in a few other elements. Not only does your car move fairly fast, but it also comes with a turbo feature so you can haphazardly drive up the wall and fly off the ceiling. You can also double jump to reach a high flying ball and miss completely. One of the more advanced techniques is to use the turbo boost mid air so you can fly of sorts and miss the ball while it's still in the air. My favorite feature is hitting the ball and having it accidentally fly into my own net, having my friends laugh and yell at me while I wonder why I'm sober.Haha, just kidding. I don't have friends.Missile Franchise however has one major advantage. And that's how easy it is to pick up. You can go weeks, if not months of not playing and still be fairly awful as you were while you still played. It's hard to take a game like Rocket League seriously and that's probably it's strongest point, mixing in both casual and hardcore players and showing that we're both equally garbage.Should you play Rocket League?I say you should, it's fun, fast, and frantic, it's great to play with others, and it also lets you destroy little kids to the point that they make high pitch noises and Pikachu sounds for the rest of the game until they quit.Seriously, I'm not joking, we did that once, we broke him.Projectile Tournament gets 8 cars flying aimlessly through the air out of 10.The curator:"

8,"1,036.1",Not Recommended," September 29, 2017",191,"********EDIT********The main purpose of this thread is to show my views on the new ban system, as well as alternatives for instant bans / permanent bans. Since there is no appeal system, there are some cases that haven't been taken into account, and I discuss them in my edit below the main thread.**********************New ban system is ridiculous.1. The ""Language Ban"" list isn't public, so how can you excpect anyone to know what is acceptable to say? Understandably there are obvious words, but some ""racial slurs"" have other meanings at a school playground, or in different countries.2. 24 Hour Ban to introduce to the ban system?? Most people play weekends which means that the very first ban accounts for half your weekly gaming! That's equivalent to an 84 hour ban (more than your ""second ban"" duration).3. Permanent ban after 4 convictions?!?!? Players invest quite often upwards of 100's of pounds or dollars or euros, and the best answer to bad language used by your community is a permanent ban? I am going to list some alternatives below, that also happen to be more relevant to the offence committed, and it took me 5 minutes to come up with...4. What is your plan to combat troll parties of 3 that will get players instant banned if they all report at the same time? I have witnessed these troll parties bully people viciously in the past, then when that person gets upset and eventually retaliates they get banned for it. How is a system that allows 3 bullies to overpower 1 innocent player a ""fair system""???Anyway, here is my list of alternative methods;>A warning report that allows innocent players a chance to correct their mistakes, by suggesting that they don't lash out in anger OR it will result in a 24 hour ban>Following the previous option, an hour ban instead of a 24 hour ban for the first ban, same reason as prior>Restricting voice and text chat for players that have abuse *voice and text chat* rather than banning them from the game completely (seen as they still should have the right to access the servers they have paid for, just not the features they have abused)>Ban count reductions for good behaviour. This means that if you have a certain number of months of not having a ban, then your total ban count gets reduced so that the previous ban doesn't count towards you ultimately getting permanently banned (Everyone deserves the chance to correct their mistakes, and no-one should have to play with the fear of slipping up or even getting a typo)>An option for you to compete against the ban allegation and tell your side of the story. As I am sure administrators have access to the full chat history and gameplay footage, players could appeal their innocence (for issues such as typo's, bullying and other such issues)To be honest, with the ban system as it is, Rocket League and thus Psyonix gives the impression that they support bullying and that they do not appreciate the continual support of their community. This and this alone is the reason for my negative review of the game, and I will be happy to change it once this issue gets fixed.********EDIT********Below I am going to list a couple of examples of bans that would need a more sophisticated ban system for justice to be done.>Replying to a question with 'You cant' but accidentally mistyping the 'a'. The suggestion here is that someone is reporting you before you can correct yourself in chat, so the admin in charge of banning you has no idea that it was a typo.>Forgetting that your discord push to talk and rocket league push to talk are the same button, so whilst someone ingame thinks you are hurling abuse at them you are actually just sharing a back and forth with your mates in a different app. Now I don't know how the verbal harrasment system works, because Psyonix won't tell us, but if it is a stacking up of reports that gets you banned then this innocent mistake would contribute to that.>A younger player asking the meaning of a word they have just read / heard. I have personally seen this happen ingame a lot. The context for this one is that the original offender can choose when to report the young player meaning their comment won't be in the report. (This is a double problem since whilst the innocent / curious young player gets banned, the original offender can continue playing rocket league happily).Now I know that there are other variants of these examples, and probably some examples that I haven't covered, but I think these cover the main ones. I am also happy that there is a system to ban the cruel / toxic players on the game to improve the community, but I believe there needs to be a way to distinguish between the cruel and the innocent. The ban system needs to be less abusable by those with malintent.Thanks for all of the support so far!

He told me he doesn't like soccer a lot either, he also told me that this game was nothing like normal soccer.So I bought it. That might be one of my best purchases of 2015, the game is extremely well-balanced and super fun to play. The graphics, physics, music etc it is just perfect.Rocket League is a physics-based vehicle soccer video game for Windows and PS4. The concept is easy: ""You have to use futuristic cars to knock a ball into the opponents goal"", you can jump into the air and use boosts to make this process easier.Pros:I would recommend this game to everyone, whether you're young or old, like FPS games or MMO RPG'S. Once you get the hang of it it is really fun to play. It is however more fun to play with friends then to play alone.It is super fun ingame with all the different cars and customizations.

60,816.8,Recommended," September 13, 2016",5,"I really recommend this game because no matter how good you are in other games, this game will bring you down. It's not like this game completely blocks off all of your hope. It's quite easy to learn but hard to master. Sometimes this games depends on luck but once you master it, it's all calculations and predictions. To master a game you must first be one with the game. On most players, this game runs on your muscle memory which lets you move your car on your wish once you get the hang of the controls. I also find this game very competitive, you'll need to trust your teammates and hope they'd succeed doing their part of the team.This game isn't one of the pay to win games you find these days, but there are cosmetics you could buy which as well help and support Psyonix for further developement of the game.I know most of you must've wondered, ""You have to pay to unlock the DLC cars"". It is questionable but Psyonix has also served you 10 free cars to begin with and they're as great as the DLC cars. As ""Octane"" is often used by players in their pro league series and until now they have given us free maps to play on as updates.also game isn't exactly the type of game you play on keyboard since most peoples play it with controllers along with pro league players so then, ""Do we have to get ourselves a controller to play this game?"" No. I've played Rocket League for almost 500 hours now with keyboards only and I've reached the rank Diamond I on Season 4. So I'm not saying that it's not possible to play with keyboards. As I said earlier, It takes time to master the game so it's very challenging.The Developer ""Psyonix"" is a very honorable mentions. They are great developers who cares about those who's system lack the power to run the updates. As on their ""Aquadome"" update, they've given us a free map with all the pretty under water environment but after the update, most players find the map very laggy for the lower end and they've decided to lessen the details. Now the map runs smoothly on both ends. Not only maps, they've figured to lower the details on cosmetics like the ""Hypernova boost"". They've also improved their server performance due to the fair amount of reports having connection problems. They're very great devs, I hope they'll stay positive as further developement runs.BUT. Even though the devs a cool, the community aren't exactly that cool. Most peoples find this game very hard as they rage quit leaving their team behind suffering a 1 v 2. Some are toxic as well but not that much. You'll also find it very difficult to understand your teammate when you teamed up with a random person without knowing or having communication with each other.Over all, I still love this game it's best game.

252,172.5,Recommended," July 12, 2015",5,"Rocket League is football/soccer done right. In FIFA you'll see every year they add new ""features"" that they think adds value to the game. In reality those features do nothing but take you further from what you want, just football.In rocket league the aim is to get the ball in the opponents goal more times than they can get it in your goal in a set amount of time. You can use flips and rocket boosting to get the ball in the goal and stop it going in yours. And that's the game. It may sound minimal and in reality it is, but because its so minimal it means getting into the game is incredibly easy. But mastering these mechanics will take forever.Every single game is different as everyone is better at something or pefer a certain playstyle. Unlike fifa where you're worrying about the multiple other ""features"" screwing you over, in rocket league it really is just some people in cars with a ball. And that's why this game is great.The ONE negative about this game is the servers. The reason the servers have been taking a dump on themselves is because of the immense amount of people trying to get on, now its only around 10k people on pc. But ps4 players who paid for ps+ got this for free this month so they've had 100k+ people trying to get on. This was a massive underestimate from the developers and I personally think it screwed up their launch immensley. However it seems to be running ok now so lets hope they've got it under control.With the correct attitude from the developers this game could become one of the most popular sports games on pc. People thinking this would become a big esports game aren't thinking straight. It's a game based entirely around the physics of a ball. It may become as big as FIFA's pro scene but thats a mere scratch on what esports really is.I rate the game 10/10 as it does what it does in a fantastic way."

I have tried and usually just get a ""deer in headlights"" stare of bewilderment.You could explain the mechanics; you play as a rocket powered RC car capable of jumping and flipping around the field, trying to score goals while flying acrobatically through the air... but that doesn't quite capture the pure excitement that Rocket League offers.Not since Hawken have I experienced Overtime this intense and victories this satisfying and I honestly don't know why that is... but it is.Negative points are few and far between but some may be: servers aren't quite capable of handling the thousands of people playing at once but the devs say they are working on it, and it has improved in the last few days. Another might be that the ""random"" unlocks are for any car but the one you prefer to use but that's just PD2 ""random"" logic I'm already used too.Overall, this game runs great; I get between 40 and 60+ fps on my upper-middle-class PC.

222,"1,146.2",Recommended," January 23, 2017",5,"Sublime, nearly perfect. Rocket League has already cemented itself one of my favorite games of all time - I really don't see myself ever stopping. When I first started playing a year ago I got to the point where I became frustrated and quit, but introducing a few friends to it got me back into it, and now that they're as good/better than me, it's just so much fun...and so, so gloriously competitive.So without friends, it's a good game. With friends that you can get better and learn with, well, it doesn't get much better.Edit: This game consumes my waking, and recently sleeping, hours. Great."
277,513.9,Recommended," February 13, 2016",5,"Rocket League is so easy to pick up it's hard to put downWhen my buddy asked me if I was going to buy Rocket League I said: ""Nah dude, I'm not so much of a soccer fan."". He told me he doesn't like soccer a lot either, he also told me that this game was nothing like normal soccer.So I bought it. That might be one of my best purchases of 2015, the game is extremely well-balanced and super fun to play. The graphics, physics, music etc it is just perfect.Rocket League is a physics-based vehicle soccer video game for Windows and PS4. The concept is easy: ""You have to use futuristic cars to knock a ball into the opponents goal"", you can jump into the air and use boosts to make this process easier.I would recommend this game to everyone, whether you're young or old, like FPS games or MMO RPG'S. Once you get the hang of it it is really fun to play. It is however more fun to play with friends then to play alone.It is super fun ingame with all the different cars and customizations. For just 20€ I consider this one of the best valued games on the Steam market.This quote is exactly how you should picture this game.NOTE: I do recommend using a controller instead of keyboard.I would rate Rocket League a solid 9/10."
94,"1,633.3",Recommended," September 7, 2015",5,"One of my favorite games. I could not stop playing it or thinking about it for about the first 30 hours of playing it. I mean, not the first 30 hours after buying it. For a few weeks, I was hooked on it until about the 30-hour mark. Then it becomes frustrating to play with random people who suck because now you're good enough to know how to play and, who knows exactly wtf they're doing. BUT, if you have a friend to play with, it's amazing fun and that doesn't matter.Best played with a controller. You can buy a fairly cheap Logitech one online or at a Best Buy or whatever. I immediately bought a $10 Logitech F310 at Best Buy when I got this game. It's so much better. But it is playable with mouse and keyboard as well.ROCKET BOOSTSSUPER ACROBATIC BATTLE CARS1v1, 2v2, 3v3, or 4v4!I find it's best played on 2v2 with a friend as your teammate. 4v4 is pure chaos. Seriously. They even named it ""Chaos.""And, guess what. Don't like soccer? Don't like race cars? Neither did I. But sometimes when you combine 2 things you don't like, they can make something really awesome that you love.**ROCKET LEAGUE!**"

143,416.9,Recommended," July 12, 2015",5,"Trying to explain just how fun this game is to people is pretty much impossible. I have tried and usually just get a ""deer in headlights"" stare of bewilderment.You could explain the mechanics; you play as a rocket powered RC car capable of jumping and flipping around the field, trying to score goals while flying acrobatically through the air... but that doesn't quite capture the pure excitement that Rocket League offers.Not since Hawken have I experienced Overtime this intense and victories this satisfying and I honestly don't know why that is... but it is.Negative points are few and far between but some may be: servers aren't quite capable of handling the thousands of people playing at once but the devs say they are working on it, and it has improved in the last few days. Another might be that the ""random"" unlocks are for any car but the one you prefer to use but that's just PD2 ""random"" logic I'm already used too.Overall, this game runs great; I get between 40 and 60+ fps on my upper-middle-class PC. It looks great even with all the AA's and motion blur turn on its not over the top. The controls work and feel great even for keyboard and mouse unlike some OTHER games... *cough* Speedrunners. It is absolutely worth $20 and I have nothing else to say."
55,105.9,Recommended," August 17, 2015",5,"Rocket SteezeUnadulterated fun and skill, Rocket League propels you into the best neo-soccer games you could ever wonder. Forget the referees and the dirty plays, this is a game built on adrenaline! The duking out of BattleBots and the overwhelming success of pulling off incredible, aerial manuevers. All in an attempt to score a goal with a seemingly arid ball is always exciting. You sport orange and blue RC cars for their respective teams, both of which come in a good number of models with customization options, such as a different shade of the existing colors, paint jobs, tires, antennas, flags and hats. I would say the variety of dome arenas are a visual marvel with a large amount of terrain to cover ground in. Though unlike its predecessor, Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars, Rocket League lacks any bumps, dips or hills on their playing fields. Despite this minor discrepancy, which I'm sure time will give light to with more DLC, I wouldn't miss out on the physics sporting event of the millenia for it!"

223,325.3,Recommended," June 27, 2017",5,"Great game. It is simple, and it is fun. Easy to learn, but hard to master. Can be played casually or competitively. It suits pretty much anybody who has ever kicked a ball in their lives. This game proof of how those annual EA FIFA-moneygrab games are trash. Too complicated, too expensive, too much community split. None of that is true in this game. Definitely worth buying when on sale."
252,172.5,Recommended," July 12, 2015",5,"Rocket League is football/soccer done right. In FIFA you'll see every year they add new ""features"" that they think adds value to the game. In reality those features do nothing but take you further from what you want, just football.In rocket league the aim is to get the ball in the opponents goal more times than they can get it in your goal in a set amount of time. You can use flips and rocket boosting to get the ball in the goal and stop it going in yours. And that's the game. It may sound minimal and in reality it is, but because its so minimal it means getting into the game is incredibly easy. But mastering these mechanics will take forever.Every single game is different as everyone is better at something or pefer a certain playstyle. Unlike fifa where you're worrying about the multiple other ""features"" screwing you over, in rocket league it really is just some people in cars with a ball. And that's why this game is great.The ONE negative about this game is the servers. The reason the servers have been taking a dump on themselves is because of the immense amount of people trying to get on, now its only around 10k people on pc. But ps4 players who paid for ps+ got this for free this month so they've had 100k+ people trying to get on. This was a massive underestimate from the developers and I personally think it screwed up their launch immensley. However it seems to be running ok now so lets hope they've got it under control.With the correct attitude from the developers this game could become one of the most popular sports games on pc. People thinking this would become a big esports game aren't thinking straight. It's a game based entirely around the physics of a ball. It may become as big as FIFA's pro scene but thats a mere scratch on what esports really is.I rate the game 10/10 as it does what it does in a fantastic way."

Mechanics of the game keep it fun and give it really good replay value. Loads of customizations for your vehicle to make it your own, plus its not locked behind a paywall, which is even more awesome. Its really exciting when your team is down and you're all working together to win the game! Or if you're on the opposite end, and you're trying to defend your net with just seconds left on the clock! The game just keeps you at the edge of your seat from start to finish. Even if the servers are down, you can play by yourself in season mode, the possibilities are endless with this game.

Seems simple enough yet this is one of the most fun games you could have played this year. Rocket League is a game that makes you say, ""Just one more match"" which turns into hours as its fun and addicting gameplay keeps you coming back for more.As you play, you collect accessories for your cars while gaining levels which luckily is done right in this game. Any game that makes you move with the gameplay because of how into it you become is doing something right. There is DLC for this game which gives you more car types and accessories and one nice thing is that Psyonix gives you the new arenas for free.This company deserves your money and have done everything right in my books to make this game one that I will continue to come back too for a long time to come.

There is a compelling reason to buy this game to play with friends on or offline but online is where it truely shines, you can be as casual or competitive as you like.Rocket League is not a game, it's a way of life.

41,"1,915.7",Recommended," June 29, 2017",3,"Nice game with great gameplay. Fun to play with your friends and friends only or when playing Solo Duel. If you play any other mode alone then you are going to be in a world of rage.95% of the playerbase are kids under 15 years, most of them will troll you and not play seriously or be AFK, or just decide to score an own goal when your team is winning with a 3-2. Oh, and let's talk about the new ban system - if you stay quiet you get banned for Unsportsmanlike Conduct, if you say ironacly ""What a save"" using the quick chat option - you get banned, if you are AFK for just 5 seconds - banned, accidently bump your teammate - banned, try to enjoy the view of the extremely beautiful Farmstead map - banned. You just get banned for everything you and it's just awful - people trying to enjoy the game and have a blast are just non-existent.Servers are a complete piece of ****. So much time this game has been developed and still Psyonix cannot fix their laggy as **** servers. It's just really sad and rage inducing. Rubber-banding is the magor problem that happens to a lot of the people playing this game. Two years have passed and still no fix for it, or at least just making the servers better.Sound effects are on point so I cannot tell anything bad about them. You can even choose a specific engine sound that you like for every car you play with - nice I guess.Visuals are great with every map - yes, Farmstead, best map of them all. Just go to practice mode and go the map. Don't play, don't practice. just look at the view with the tree and birds flying and leaves falling - such a great map.Overall - 5/10"

A lot of people leave matches to avoid losses or rage quit, but matchmaking usually fills the AI slot within a few seconds or so.Kinda wish I had bought this game sooner into it's life, but better late than never.

Buy it even for its full price, dont wait for sale - you wont regret it.One warning though - buy it with some friends and play with them.

75,871.8,Recommended," March 30, 2016",3,"So, I've played this game for about 250 hours as im writing this review and I still enjoy it as much as I did when I first started this masterpiece.Balancing in this game is pretty straight forward. Different cars have different physics (only minor and really slight changes to its handling and hitboxes. Yes, you can buy different cars with the DLC's and yes you might have some advantage doing so, but in my whole experience with the game I only ONCE had the feeling, that another car might have changed a single shot in one game. There is actually a top list of all cars in the game and the free cars are rocking the top 3 spots - i think this is enough to prove that this game isnt a pay-to-win. The other car costumisations are just optical, but you can pimp yo ride together and have a ""firefighter"" team, just like me and my mates.Matchmaking in this game works really well and you barely get any players, that are way above or below your skill group.This said, ranking up feels really satisfying and you feel like you deserved it. Same goes for deranking of course. I've had some really fun times with friends when I was playing casually, but sometimes you just wanna win some games and it just feels so good, when you win a game after a long overtime with a well placed aerial shot.Speaking of that, this game has a really high learning curve and the skill ceiling is pretty much non-existent. You can always improve on stuff like aerials, game sense and goalkeeping.The only thing I can recommend to improve is to paly games and have a fixed teammate. This helped me a lot.Now to the points I dislike about this game. The community.... Sometimes youre lucky and noone in the entire game uses the quick chat ""OMG"". It doesnt really matter if ""This Guy"" is on your team or the other, he will still ruin the game for all the others. There is the option to mute him, but it still is sad, that this beauty of a game is ruined by kids.In the recent updates the developers added in some really interesting things like experimental maps, new gamemodes and ranked seasons to make things more interesting. I think this is an important factor for the game. We've all heard about those developers that release their game and just abandon it because they already got their money. I really wish there was some kind of workshop inplementation for costum maps, but since this game is multi-platform this is a problem for the playstation folks.Rocket League is a possibly competetive ""racing-football (soccer)- team-based game in which the better player is often rewarded with the well deserved victory. This means that luck is a factor, but a good player can change his playstyle accordingly to counter this luck factor."

115,11.0,Recommended," December 25, 2015",3,"When I first seen this game I am not going to lie I thought it was just another ""fad"" and this game would quickly die out so I ignored it. Boy was I wrong. This is in all ways a great game. First off, it's really easy to get into. No crazy rules or anything to memorize, its just one of those games that is easy to pick up but hard to master. Optimization for this game is STELLAR. I was personally expecting my build to run it terribly as it runs most other games pretty bad but I was happily surprised to find this game to run smooth as butter. There are also a ton of customization options, a decent amount to start off with and more are unlocked through playing matches. Controls feel fluid and ""right"". What I mean by that is a lot of games these days the controls just feel off and ehh. I was playing with a PS4 controller and it works flawlessly and the controls are great although the default sensitivity I found to be a bit low so I had to adjust that. My main problem I have with this game is the matchmaking system. Honestly it's not great as beginners will be paired up with pros which is a pain so expect your first few hours in the game to be an absolute wreck. Another thing I have to say I don't like about this game it would be the maps. Don't get me wrong they are all really pretty but all the maps are essentially just different backgrounds of the same pill shaped stadium. It would be cool if different maps had certain features to them that made them for unique (like ramps in different parts of the maps). Other than that this is definitely a must buy, i'm really sad I hadn't tried this out sooner."

I can say that this game is not for everyone as I have recommended it to friends who then proceeded to refund the game because they weren't able to get into it. Just don't go into the game expecting to trickshot your way into goal because it'll be a lot more exciting when you finally learn how to hit the ball consistently rather than driving donuts around it."

420,25.6,Recommended," July 17, 2015",3,"Rocket League is easily one of my favorite multiplayer games.Everything runs completely smooth, I haven't run into a single glitch or lag spike, there's no voice chat (that i know of) which is good because, while I would like to communicate with my team, there's no telling whether they would listen or whether an 11 year old would tell me what my mother's been doing.Every goal made rewards you with an extremely satisfying explosion it leaves me wanting more. But not from the developers, I just can't stop playing xDMy only complaint is I would like more levels, which I'm assuming levels will be added or switched out over time. A new game mode would be nice too. Like and Anti Gravity mode where you have unlimited boost and have to fly around for the ball.

There is other DLC you can pay for to support Psyonix but it's not a pay to win type DLC scenario.- Very chilled, the community is one of the best I've ever experienced in online gaming. Had a bad day at the office? Come home and play some Rocket League to relax. Getting battered by EAids on FIFA? Play some Rocket League to remember why you play games, for enjoyment. Not playing well? It's alright, most teammates will be very understanding and there are quite a few who will offer you tips on how to improve!- You don't have to be good to enjoy it. I've played almost 50 hours on this wonderful piece of art and must admit I'm still pretty bad. I can't aerial to save my life and am an awful goalie. But I still thoroughly enjoy playing this game as it's a childhood dream come true to drive really fast cars and play football at the same time.All in all Rocket League is an absolutely incredible game of which I highly, highly recommend."

1,64.8,Recommended," July 22, 2015",3,"FIFA with Rocket Cars.Rocket League is one of those great ideas that may have found its way into little minigames embedded in larger games, but Psyonix finally decided to go ahead and make a full fledged experience dedicated to it. Essentially a soccer game where you drive a car to bump a giant soccer ball around, Rocket League has plenty of epic saves and amazing goals that keep you coming back for more. There is even a ranking system plus a competitive matchmaking mode for those who want to test their mettle against similarly skilled players.Psyonix has also pledged to not introduce powerups or any changes to game balance, which is fantastic as all the cars handle the same essentially. I've heard rumors that some of the hitboxes and handling are slightly different between cars, but it is negligible at best. I've missed these kinds of games, where there are no silly ""perks"" a la Call of Duty or car customization that can give you an edge in any way. It's just you, your car, and the ball. The new DLC cars are mostly novelties and haven't given an edge to any particular model of car, which is fantastic.I've been following this game for quite some time so I bought it almost instantly when it was released. I highly recommend you pick it up if you're a fan of competitive sports games. Seeing as it's been top seller on steam for a couple weeks now, I'm sure this game will continue to have a healthy, active community for a long, long time."

173,"1,803.5",Recommended," January 7, 2017",3,"I was not paid to write this review. I paid for my copy of the game (and three copies for friends on steam). I paid for the keys to open crates in-game.PC Used: i7-4790k; GTX 1080; 24gb RAM; 1tb SSD.4K support on PC version works flawlessly and a single GTX 1080 provides more than 60fps constantly on Ultra settings. It is eye-blindingly gorgeous.Synopsis: Rocket League is football, hockey and basketball with cars.Review:Not since the days of picking up Mario Kart for the first time has a racing game been so engrossing and immediately addictive. Rocket League has a thriving online community, integrated play between console and PC players, and enough fun and engaging customization options to allow everyone to drive a car that feels immediately theirs.Dare to look beneath the hood and you will find this is a game that has a subtle but definite skill curve. Even after hundreds of hours you will find that you are still improving the look of the car and modifying the way that you play. The geniuses at Psyonix have built a game that genuinely seeps with their obsession to get everything just right. From the car mechanics, to the ball physics, and to the curvature of the arena walls that you will begin driving up and using as though gravity does not apply to the likes of you.There is a great crate system. Crates are earned through play-time and they require keys to open. Keys can be purchased at an additional cost or earned through trading other items or crates for them). It is often possible to land items in crates from time to time that can be extremely valuable; for instance, I now have numerous rare animated car decals and painted wheels that are worth between 20 keys and 40 keys each (twice the value of buying the game!).There is nothing quite as satisfying and rapid a multiplayer experience online and I whole-hardheartedly encourage you to pick up a copy of this game because you will get much more than your money's worth. The main mode is football, but hockey is just as satisfying. A tip for playing football is to not race to the wall and to anticipate the rebound and position to meet it there. In hockey, the opposite applies and you should gun up the wall to meet the puck on the wall and fire it around the arena towards their goal.This game is the first game I would say has ever come close to a 10/10 for me. Sure, there is even more to look forward to from this game in the future with continued meaningful updates. But whether you buy on xbox, ps4, or Steam, you are in for a brilliant experience. You do not even have to like or be good at FIFA or real football to find this enjoyable, which is testament in itself that it truly holds its position as a bonafide e-sport of its own.The e sport competition each year with the best players has a prize pool of $125,000 and will keep growing.CONCLUSION:Amazing stuff. You won't be disappointed."

283,923.7,Recommended," November 11, 2016",3,"No wait, don't leave just because it's soccer and has cars. That's what I did for months, and I regret it.Rocket League is best experienced by playing it once. Anywhere, in any state of mind. Just try it once and you'll know if you'd like to play it more. I did, and was hooked. Bought the game the very next day and have averaged 4 hours per day since.The concept is simple enough: You control a car. There's a ball and some goals. The opponent is trying to mess you up and you're trying to put the ball in their goal. Think kindergarten kids playing soccer: They're all just running after the ball with no clue about what to do with it, other than to kick it.Then you start doing pinch-moves on the walls, flying through the air, dribbling on the roof of your car. More advanced techniques to accompany your game. You've become the average player, making some nice looking plays in the air.After a while, you realize there's even a deeper level still. There's positioning, strategies, passing plays, mind-games... While the barrier to entry is really low - It might take you literally less than a minute to get familiar with the controls - it takes years to get to the top, to master some things that are possible. The skill ceiling is impossibly high.The best part is: You'll be having fun all the way."

96,150.8,Recommended," February 5, 2016",3,"This is it. This is the moment your whole life has been leading up to. Weeks of training, months of dedicated work to get yourself into peak condition; all for this. Your brain goes into overdrive as you see the ball barrelling towards you. With a well-placed hit, you effortlessly send it flying to the other side of the field. Your teammate, seeing an opening, leaps toward the ball and continues to lead it towards the opposing team’s goal. Abandoning your position of defense, you begin a pursuit of your own; a pursuit of glory. Time itself seems to slow to a crawl as your comrade sends the ball skyward, right into position. But time is of the essence. and it’s not exactly on your side either. The countdown begins; 10, 9, 8, 7… With the last of your energy, you bound towards the ball at top speed. The odds may be against you, but damn the odds; you’re going for gold! With a graceful leap, you make a last ditch effort to score the winning goal. This’ll be a buzzer-beater to remember!You miss the ball completely.REVIEWRocket LeagueGENREPhysics-Based Car SoccerDeveloped by the up-and-coming game development studio, Psyonix; Rocket League is the far more famous sequel to the lesser-known Playstation Network classic, Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle-Cars. [Hopefully, I won’t have to say that again. Er, type that again.] In Rocket League, you assume control of a battle-car in what can only be assumed is the ‘Rocket League’; a high-octane, high speed, supersport with a high mortality rate. In reality, it's car soccer, but that’s not important; what is important is the fact that you’re a mother♥♥♥♥in’ battle-car playing supersonic future soccer. In this utopian society, Rocket League is a high-intensity sport adored by millions, but experienced only by the elite few. As it just so happens, the ‘elite few’ is actually the ‘not-so-elite you!' Train hard enough though, and you’ll master the wonky physics of car soccer, save so many shots that your teammates may as well just nail you to a cross and call you the son of God, and maybe even perform aerial maneuvers so sick the entire crowd goes home with leukemia! Only the strong will survive in the Rocket League!In theory, Rocket League is almost the quintessence of simplicity within game design. You can drive, drift, jump, and boost. In practice? Not so much. Driving is as straightforward as it comes, mind the fact that you can drive on walls. Drifting is sufficiently simple as well, you can powerslide and change which way you spin whilst mid-air. Jumping, however is where things get complicated. When you jump, you have a variety of options to choose from for your next move. For example: simply pressing the jump button will send you directly skyward, another press and you’ll perform a double-jump. Pressing any direction whilst jumping will send you tumbling in that direction, performing two of these ‘flip-jumps’ in succession will send you barreling in a direction of your choosing without the need for boost. Speaking of boosting; hoo boy.You can boost while driving to, well, boost your speed. Simple, yeah? If you reach maximum speed, hitting an opponent will reduce their car to a smoking pile of rubble. That’s ground-based boosting. Air-based boosting is a whole different ball-park. With a hop, skip, and/or a jump, a little angling, and fingers to press left mouse with; you’ll be able to use your boost to soar gracefully like an eagle! Or not, it takes some practice.So that's the basics of the controls, but what about the game itself? Well, as previously stated, Rocket League is car soccer; no, really. You're in a car, there's two teams and a ball, and the objective is to score the most goals within a five minute timeframe. That's, uh, that's it. Sort of.There's four primary game modes in Rocket League; Duel, Doubles, Standard, and Chaos. Simply put, these are just neat little names for 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, and 4v4. [Coolio, huh?] There's also ranked variants of all of these archetypes excluding chaos, as it’s, well, a bit chaotic. Occasionally, limited time game modes will appear. At the time of writing, the most recent mode was ‘Snow Day’; a Christmas themed variant featuring lower gravity and a puck rather than a ball. It was pretty neat.Y’know what else is neat? Customization. Y’know what Rocket League has a metric ♥♥♥♥-ton of? CUSTOMIZATION. From body to boost trail, hubcaps to hats, and everything inbetween; Rocket League offers the Cosmetic Junkie within all of us the good♥♥♥♥♥♥ the premium cut. Then again, maybe it's just me that's crazy for that stuff. That ♥♥♥♥♥ my bread’n’butter. I need help. Oh, and don't go worrying your pretty little head about not getting that super-special hat you wanted; Rocket League rewards players with cosmetics after every match regardless of performance.Help, by the by, is in ample supply! Striker, to goalie, learn to play on the fly! Sorry. What I mean to say is that Rocket League has a variety of training modes worn which to hone your skills. In addition to basic and advanced tutorials; there's striker, goalie, and aerial training, as well as basic sandbox mode. The game may be hard to master, but you can't say it doesn't help you along.Let's say you get cold feet though; let's say you're intimidated with the prospect of going straight to online and ballin’ it with someone from Bali. Well, reader, in that case; why not peruse the offline bot-match options? Firstly, there's exhibition mode; a standard bot mode where you make the rules and play at your of leisure. The AI scales in difficulty with 4 increments; Rookie, Pro, All-Star, and Unfair. Unfair is exclusive to exhibition mode, as it's an asymmetric hell-hole. [In a good way, trust me.]Should that not entice you, season mode awaits your beckon. In season mode, you create a team and duke it out in the Rocket League for chance at some good ol’ virtual glory! Simply choose what difficulty, how many players, what team, and how many weeks and bam; you're ready to go.The music’s pretty swanky too, if I do say so myself. [Which is kinda redundant if you think about it; I mean, is it possible to not say something as yourself? Anyway, tangents are pretty neato.] There’s good tracks in there, a couple okay, but the only true atrocity is that it only plays on the main menu. I mean, yeah, you could always just find the OST on Youtube and play it in the background, but it seems like a smidge of an oversight to be honest.So that's Rocket League; the hip new rocket-sport that all the cool kids on the block have been spackin’ ‘bout! I've never fancied myself much a fan of sports, though I have been getting into football. [Not futbol, mind you.] But I digress, the point is; even if you don't much like sports, this could be the game for you. Simply put, if you're a fan of high-octane, easy to learn, hard to master, physics based, team-reliant, competitive gameplay; Rocket League will be a blast for ya’. It's been hours of fun between my friends and I, and I don't see the end anywhere nearby.

I paid for the keys to open crates in-game.PC Used: i7-4790k; GTX 1080; 24gb RAM; 1tb SSD.4K support on PC version works flawlessly and a single GTX 1080 provides more than 60fps constantly on Ultra settings. It is eye-blindingly gorgeous.Synopsis: Rocket League is football, hockey and basketball with cars.Review:Not since the days of picking up Mario Kart for the first time has a racing game been so engrossing and immediately addictive. Rocket League has a thriving online community, integrated play between console and PC players, and enough fun and engaging customization options to allow everyone to drive a car that feels immediately theirs.Dare to look beneath the hood and you will find this is a game that has a subtle but definite skill curve. Even after hundreds of hours you will find that you are still improving the look of the car and modifying the way that you play. The geniuses at Psyonix have built a game that genuinely seeps with their obsession to get everything just right. From the car mechanics, to the ball physics, and to the curvature of the arena walls that you will begin driving up and using as though gravity does not apply to the likes of you.There is a great crate system. Crates are earned through play-time and they require keys to open. Keys can be purchased at an additional cost or earned through trading other items or crates for them). It is often possible to land items in crates from time to time that can be extremely valuable; for instance, I now have numerous rare animated car decals and painted wheels that are worth between 20 keys and 40 keys each (twice the value of buying the game!).There is nothing quite as satisfying and rapid a multiplayer experience online and I whole-hardheartedly encourage you to pick up a copy of this game because you will get much more than your money's worth. The main mode is football, but hockey is just as satisfying. A tip for playing football is to not race to the wall and to anticipate the rebound and position to meet it there. In hockey, the opposite applies and you should gun up the wall to meet the puck on the wall and fire it around the arena towards their goal.This game is the first game I would say has ever come close to a 10/10 for me. Sure, there is even more to look forward to from this game in the future with continued meaningful updates. But whether you buy on xbox, ps4, or Steam, you are in for a brilliant experience. You do not even have to like or be good at FIFA or real football to find this enjoyable, which is testament in itself that it truly holds its position as a bonafide e-sport of its own.The e sport competition each year with the best players has a prize pool of $125,000 and will keep growing.CONCLUSION:Amazing stuff. You won't be disappointed."

94,260.7,Recommended," March 8, 2016",3,"This is my favorite game of the year 2015. Fun, addictive and skillbased.Best played with a controller IMO.Some people complain about a toxic community. I haven't encountered much of that but I rarely play ranked. As when playing any real life sport this game makes you feel that tension, hope to do better and small annoyance whenever your opposition outplays you. Still; 95% of all people I played against were good sports and took it with a smile whether winning or losing.I mostly played 3v3 and 4v4 and feel that there is where the game truly shines. When a team works together on positioning and helping eachother, complement eachother so to say, is where the game goes from good to the best sports-like game I've ever played.This game makes that football/soccer feeling more present than any Fifa game ever has so far. Hitboxes and physics are precise and a joy to behold when you interprete the ball's path and your angle on impact right.This is one of those games that set new standards IMO. Already to be considered a classic and a worthy one of that title. You owe it to yourself to try it to see what sport games can be like in the future. More precise, more tense, more fun, more sports.This is a great game. Try it out! (and get a refund if it's not up your alley but atleast try it to see what it is)."

75,871.8,Recommended," March 30, 2016",3,"So, I've played this game for about 250 hours as im writing this review and I still enjoy it as much as I did when I first started this masterpiece.Balancing in this game is pretty straight forward. Different cars have different physics (only minor and really slight changes to its handling and hitboxes. Yes, you can buy different cars with the DLC's and yes you might have some advantage doing so, but in my whole experience with the game I only ONCE had the feeling, that another car might have changed a single shot in one game. There is actually a top list of all cars in the game and the free cars are rocking the top 3 spots - i think this is enough to prove that this game isnt a pay-to-win. The other car costumisations are just optical, but you can pimp yo ride together and have a ""firefighter"" team, just like me and my mates.Matchmaking in this game works really well and you barely get any players, that are way above or below your skill group.This said, ranking up feels really satisfying and you feel like you deserved it. Same goes for deranking of course. I've had some really fun times with friends when I was playing casually, but sometimes you just wanna win some games and it just feels so good, when you win a game after a long overtime with a well placed aerial shot.Speaking of that, this game has a really high learning curve and the skill ceiling is pretty much non-existent. You can always improve on stuff like aerials, game sense and goalkeeping.The only thing I can recommend to improve is to paly games and have a fixed teammate. This helped me a lot.Now to the points I dislike about this game. The community.... Sometimes youre lucky and noone in the entire game uses the quick chat ""OMG"". It doesnt really matter if ""This Guy"" is on your team or the other, he will still ruin the game for all the others. There is the option to mute him, but it still is sad, that this beauty of a game is ruined by kids.In the recent updates the developers added in some really interesting things like experimental maps, new gamemodes and ranked seasons to make things more interesting. I think this is an important factor for the game. We've all heard about those developers that release their game and just abandon it because they already got their money. I really wish there was some kind of workshop inplementation for costum maps, but since this game is multi-platform this is a problem for the playstation folks.Rocket League is a possibly competetive ""racing-football (soccer)- team-based game in which the better player is often rewarded with the well deserved victory. This means that luck is a factor, but a good player can change his playstyle accordingly to counter this luck factor."

The developers are fantastic; really involved with the community, constantly updating the game with new requested features, and best of all, no pay-to-win microtransactions. Personally I'm completely fine with paying a couple of bucks for some new cars just as a way to support Psyonix.

85,"1,293.0",Recommended," July 8, 2016",3,"Rocket League has provided me the most fun I've had in any game in a long time. The learning curve is great and doesn't discourage new players. It combines both soccer and super sonic, acrobatic, rocket powered battlecars. A combination that mixes very well. Yes, there are microtransactions (you can turn them off if you want), but its not in your face about it and its just for purely cosmetic stuff so its not pay to win. The community is friendly for the most part but in every game there are toxic people, the report system is very effective and if it gets too bad you can disable chat. All in all, this is a great game that is alot of fun and I reccommend you buy it if you're thinking about it.9/10i like vroom vroom"

These include the stems, leaves and roots — and even the flower bud.This game teaches you life lessons.10/10Would buy for a friend."

Especially in todays age where games are a dime a dozen, this is such a unique concept and done perfectly. This is an absolutely must own for anyone sick of the bs people call games these days."
16,"1,410.1",Recommended," September 23, 2016",3,"I've been playing this game for just about a year now and it is, by far, the best game I have ever played. In the past, I was into shooter games and games that get your blood pressure high. I love soccer, I love cars, and rockets are cool too so I decided to try out Rocket League. It's an amazingly well-developed game with short, 5-10 minute games, tens of thousands of customization options, and even amazing graphics! The developers are getting more and more creative as they add amazing new fields and gamemodes to experiment with. I would definitely recommend this game and it is definitely worth the $20.00."
6,415.9,Recommended, March 11,3,"Rocket League, at its most basic, it’s football (soccer) with boost powered battle cars. The concept may sound strange, but the team over at Psyonix really hit the nail on the head here. Let’s tackle this review one step at a time.Gameplay: What bad can I say, it’s great. Controls are good and easily customisable if you don’t like the default, the game paces really well depending on your skill level, every match offers a new challenge to face as every player has slightly different strengths and weaknesses. Sometimes you’ll get absolutely destroyed but all it becomes is a lesson as long as you take the defeat and realise that you made mistakes in that match. The game is great to just pick up and goof around with, but also has a thriving eSports scene for anyone wanting to become pro at it. The learning curve may be steep, but it’s not all forced upon you, you take each skill and learn it one at a time, and there’s always something to learn. Never do you feel like you’re not improving or there’s nothing to learn. There’s always a goal to achieve. And that’s what is great. There’s always something new to try.Community: Here’s where the game starts to fall short, with great YouTubers and tutorial makers and steam community users, it looks great, but play at least 10 games and you’ll notice that some players like to believe they’re the greatest. Spamming ‘What a save!’ every time they score. Not to mention scammers, who curse the trading market everyday with their tricks. However, as a player, you learn to overlook that. It’s the spirit of football (soccer). Go to any Soccer match in real life and people chant and start acting like hooligans. It’s the spirit of the game. Not saying that the negative players are justified, but it was always going to happen. The same with scammers. But once you look past that you see thousands of hours of fun."

474,382.4,Recommended," November 25, 2015",3,"The game is repetitive they said...The game gets boring they said...The servers are bad they said...The matchmaking sucks they said...Put 45 hours into this game in 2 weeks approaching finals for college and still going.In my opinion, this is one of the greatest video game experiences out there. Nothing like chasing after the ball that's going towards your goal, flying, and knocking the ball away to win in the last 10 seconds. No other game will make you freak out over simple stuff like Rocket League does... unless you play/watch competitive Smash... or you are 10 and play COD. This game is meant to be played with friends so you can communicate and scream at each other for giving up a goal. I can now read my friend's mind after playing with him so much.I've only had a few problems with matchmaking, and that was when I was starting out and was really bad. Now I'm just sorta bad. I've also only had one problem with the servers timing out, punishing me, and locking me out of matchmaking for 15 minutes, but it gave me an excuse to do the aerial training and play 1v2 with bots. Also, bots suck most of the time, but are extremely frustrating at other times when they get perfect shots off at ridiculous angles. Just play with friends or strangers if you have no friends. Just go make a friend. Or don't. Its your life.9/10 - there is no Turkey hat for ThanksgivingEdit:This game has become my favorite game to play on Steam. I cannot recommend this game enough. The level of skill you develop with this game is pretty incredible. You go from barely being able to time your jump to hit the ball to doing incredible aerials off the walls to get an incredible shot on goal only to have the defense make an equally incredible save. With some of the hits that I manage to get and the incredible angles that you can get shots from is shocking to say the least. Its amazing that your brain can wire itself to think you have to roll at this millisecond in order to slip it between two defenders and roll it into the goal... but I'm just rambling now.Now stay with me here, I'm gonna say something that you might freak out over. You can turn back now if you want. Still here? Alright... 3... 2... I think this game has the same feel as Smash does in the sense that there is just an incredibly high skill ceiling. Yep, I said it. But seriously, watch some of the top players in the world who play this game. Its a work of art how they can move their car so accurately whether it be in the air or on the ground for the perfect shot or pass. Oh the passing... I almost forgot. Once you get to a certain level of play, you start thinking of how to pass it to you teammate who is flying down middle for a small tap in goal. I'm not talking about centering off the corner, I mean like popping it up in the middle from mid field and basically setting it for a teammate to get a shot on goal. It become something more than ""hey lets hit this ball as hard as we can"" to ""hey, Imma try and tip it up for you and throw off the defense for an open goal"".Only one last thing to keep in mind is that while a lot of the community is nice and friendly, there are a LOT of toxic players who play this game and they will drive you nuts for the 7 minutes that it takes to complete a game. Be warned. If you get this game or currently play it, be nice for everyone's sake and have some fun :)All in all, my favorite game on Steam - 10/10 they gave us a cockroach for a hat"

I can say that this game is not for everyone as I have recommended it to friends who then proceeded to refund the game because they weren't able to get into it. Just don't go into the game expecting to trickshot your way into goal because it'll be a lot more exciting when you finally learn how to hit the ball consistently rather than driving donuts around it."

It's also visually stunning and runs great, but the graphics are just an extra treat, the real substance is a game that leaves you wanting more and more after every match.

623,826.8,Recommended," November 19, 2015",3,"Rocket League has a simple concept, hitting a huge sized ball to a goal using rocket boosted cars. It's easy to get into, but the skill ceiling allows you to keep learning and getting better after every single play session. That happens to be one of the most addicting parts of the game for me, always feeling like improving.The game can currently be played from 1v1 to 3v3 as ranked and 4v4 and Mutator Mashup as unranked/casual variations. Mutator Mashup being mixes of different game settings, affecting for instance ball size. Allowing you to play with a huge sized cubical ball in a low gravity field etc. Not forgetting, Rocket League also has a number of different styles to play against bots. Their difficulty goes from them putting the ball in their own goal to them being surprisingly hard to play against.If you happen to be the first one of your friend group trying to decide whether to buy it or not, it can be perfectly played alone. Having friends of course making it easier to communicate, other than a few commands e.g. ""Defending"",""I got it"" etc. On a final note, , as the game plays a lot better using a controller in my opinion. Althought the buttons can be rebinded on both keyboard and controller.Pros:Cons:"

161,417.7,Recommended," November 23, 2017",3,"The game is simply great. It's simple. But yet, fun. Car meets soccar (football for some) You drive a car and your goal is to hit the ball into the goal. There are plenty of beautiful skins you can unlock and decals. But you do have to buy the cars in MTX. though they're cheap. But at least they're not making the game unfair as all cars are the same other than their size and hitboxes. So the game in the end is still fair. and its a game I can sink days into.

I couldn't really get into such sports, watching teams and blah blah blah. I don't even play Fifa and other such games.But i loved this game.

171,356.9,Not Recommended," December 17, 2016",3,"As fun as a game as this is (it is), i sadly cannot offer it a good review.The game is full of a rather foul toxic community in which i commonly witness the 'hardcore' player base (the 1,000+ hour people) telling others to uninstall the game because someone blocks their shot (yeah, telling someone they suck and to remove the game because someone else blocked said victims shot) and this is just the tip of the problems with the players, people take their anger out on one another, no one seems capable of playing a game through until the end as they either leave the minute a goal is scored (against them) or if it doesn't seem they will win (sad people can't play a game and accept someone has to loose and someone has to win) and players reset their progress to go from the top rank to playing against Rookies (new players) just so they can keep winning, which only drives away new players anyway, in short killing the game. The more you play, the more toxic players you meet, i found the lower ranks when first starting was (usually) fine and most games was okay, after you hit Veteran rank however, the toxic players are everywhere. the game also has a stupid habit of pairing long time players against new players, i can play a doubles game and find myself fighting Rookies to the game which isn't fun for me or them.On the positive side, the game is actually quite fun if you can look past the toxic players and bad matchmaking systems (and server connection problems and the fact each update makes it take ages to find games), i have spent 200+ hours on few games so i can say it does has its fun moments but i recommend either playing with a friend or getting someone over to play (yes, a game that features splitscreen does exist!) as it is much more fun with people you know and when playing alone, it grows kind of boring.All in all, a fun game ruined by the player base and a developer who only seems to care about micro-transaction loot crates (thankfully these are cosmetic only) as opposed to fixing their matchmaking system and the endless server issues."

As a person who has been gaming since the ATARI 2600 let me tell you what, Rocket League is amazing. Only games with no violence, no hacking, and can be played with Keyboard/Mouse or console controller."
161,417.7,Recommended," November 23, 2017",3,"The game is simply great. It's simple. But yet, fun. Car meets soccar (football for some) You drive a car and your goal is to hit the ball into the goal. There are plenty of beautiful skins you can unlock and decals. But you do have to buy the cars in MTX. though they're cheap. But at least they're not making the game unfair as all cars are the same other than their size and hitboxes. So the game in the end is still fair. and its a game I can sink days into. It can be addicting. Especially when you're flying, and air dribbling."
21,557.9,Recommended," November 27, 2017",3,"At first glance, the Rocket League can show off as an ordinary arcade, but it's not at all so. I can say rl-football, but it's safe, not costly and quite interesting. The game of its kind is very simple, but at the same time unique and worthy of attention. As many people expressed: ""We kick the ball at a new level.""What is a Rocket League?Football simulator, which will appeal to every player and he will find something in it for himself.There are two types of matching games that are common and competitive.Do you want to have fun, have fun with your friends after a hard day? Then the usual selection of games for you!Choose a custom game mode and play as much as you like.Relax, playing solo, doubles, standart in the same selection of games.Do you want to play in earnest, but seriously, honing skill skills and getting a return from the game in the form of a title? In that case, it's best to choose a competitive selection of games.Further, in the style of your game, you can choose what suits you more: solo, doubles, standart (solo).If you are at this level to play with your friends, you will not even have to choose.Playing in the competitive mode, you will need skills, which you can learn and sharpen in the training. There are many trainings directly in the game itself, as well as a myriad of workshops.Losing in the Rocket League a considerable number of hours, I can say that there are no cons to the game as such, but there are enough pluses.The main advantage of the game is that absolutely anyone can get training and start more or less successfully to play. Also one of the main plus-community, which in the majority is friendly and tuned to a pleasant game and communication in its time.I'm happy with the game and every time I want to go back to it again and again. I want to play, I'm more sure of what you like."

22,242.7,Not Recommended, April 13,3,"Rocket League has long been a favorite game of mine until the last update where for me it has made the game basically unplayable. Servers are an absolute mess, connections are terrible and the matchmaking is worse. Standard play at peak hour on a friday and i am getting matched with Gold/Low Platinum players when i am ranked d3/c1 which makes the game boring as hell. Boost trail glitch where boost is constantly running behind my car every now and then, controller bindings are ruined 50% of the time i login and R2 (accelerate) binds itself to boost so i cant move unless i have boost. And no there is nothing wrong with my controller, i have tried other ones. Tournament is buggy as **** and a lot of the time won't even join the matches or will kick me from the tournament and grant the other players the free win.If anyone is looking at buying rocket league now is not the time, wait until they patch these bugs and take it back to the game it used to be.Yours Sincerely, an angry RL fanboy"
59,891.6,Not Recommended, April 12,3,"Right now the game isn't worth to buy.Broken chat, banning and loads of buggs and lag on the servers.Last year this game was great, right now it's only fun offline or on a private server.Most of the problems aren't really a big deal if there were only one or 2 problems. But currently it isn't a working game.Maybe in a couple months the team will reconsider the changes or might have a fix for the problems.They went heavy on the toxic chat, but that was a wrong move in my opinion.Toxic chat was due to bad match-ups and lagging servers in most of my games.Not because people wanted to spread hate, they were mostly annoyed.Maybe that's the best word to discribe the game right now.AnnoyingGreetings from a very SAD RL player"

113,"6,153.6",Recommended," November 27, 2016",6,"Rocket League is a game with an exponentially high skill cap. Its gameplay can be loose and quirky, or tight and calculated, it all depends on how skilled the players involved are. You can laugh at your mistakes, or choose to take each one to heart, trying to improve upon your skills. Just remember in the end that while Rocket League can be frustrating at times, if you persevere you can gain consistency and improve your skill as long as you don't let your failures keep you from overcoming the same issue the next time. There are always new ways to play, and with each new one, occasionally bugs are added, but the dev team always works hard to keep the game as bug-free and entertaining to play as possible, and I think that's part of why the game is as popular as it is.Thanks goes out to everyone who keeps trying, and doesn't put down others for not knowing as much as they do. Because we all know at one point we were just as bad when we started playing, and encouragement keeps the community friendly and growing."

314,366.3,Recommended," July 9, 2015",6,"This has been some of the most fun I've had playing an online game in a very long time. It's a game you really have to play, and feel, in order to truly understand the hype. This is a game I honestly think almost anyone can enjoy. Even if you're not typically a fan of sports games, like myself, or don't particularly like cars or racing, I still feel like there's a ton of enjoyment to be had with Rocket League. It's a game that is even more fun to play than it looks.Every match creates an impressive sense of tension that makes each goal, assist, cross, clear or save feel extremely satisfying. The tight and responsive controls only add to this, as nearly every play or mistake simply comes down to your ability and timing. The controls are intuitive enough to pick up quickly but with an immense amount of depth. You can easily spend hundreds of hours honing your skills and still have room to improve. There's a huge skill cap and the gap between players can be extremely obvious. Thankfully, even the unranked matchmaking has MMR, so you generally always get matched against players of equal skill.It looks as though things will only keep get better with the seasons and ranked divisions. There's currently ranked 1v1, team ranked 2v2, and solo ranked 3v3. They will be adding more in the near future including a team ranked 3v3 (Woo!). There's a lot of potential here for some amazing competitve gameplay and I can't wait to see it.There's already a ton of stuff to unlock in-game as you level up; everything from new vehicles to a very large variety of ways to customize them, as well as some hidden secrets. You unlock things almost every game, so you always have something to look forward to. The devs want to support the game for years and will be adding more content to the game as time goes on. Some of it will be paid addons with new cars, ways to customize, etc., but every future map will be free to all.TL;DR I can think of few better ways to spend $20 if you're looking for a really fun game that you can sink a ton of time into. This game makes me feel like a kid again, and I love it.I have high hopes for this game! I will continue to update this review as I play more."

474,149.3,Recommended," October 19, 2015",6,"I'm going to do a very simple Pros and Cons Review of this game.TL:DR; 10/10, have never played a game that causes me to scream in agony, facepalm at the sheer stupidity of what I just did, and have a giant grin on my face laughing with friends all in the matter of 5 minutes.PROS-100's of cool and unique customations for your vehicles, including hats, and antennaes (There are also some popular gaming communities flags included in the game to show off your love for Lirik or RoosterTeeth etc.)-Besides marginal differences and a slight variation in hitboxes all vehicles handle the same, allowing you to pick your car based on preference of look and not based on which is ""op""-The game play can be summed up as ""easy to learn, difficult to master""-There are many maps with more free maps and whacky new game modes to be added.-The camera has multiple sliders to allow you to tinker with the camera until its exactly how you like-Seamless switching between controller and keyboard-Runs at a smooth 60FPS-Split-screen-1v1,2v2,3v3,and 4v4 game modes-DLC has no in-game advantages hidden behind a pay-wall, they are strictly cosmetic and only for if you'd like to help out the devs(Not to mention the first DLC is a reference to Fast and Furious)-Tons of options, very in-depth video, sound, and interface options that any PC gamer will be content with.-Very nice and easy to use Quick-Chat in game to quickly tell your teammates when you are defending or going for the ball during kick-off, as well as spam NICE-SHOT when an enemy accidentally own goals.-Ranked system has a very basic elo system, start at 0 pts, go through Bronze, Silver, Gold, Etc. Nice and simple, win more than you lose and you will advance.-Season system against bots that's great for when you just want to sit back and relax without the worry of competitive matchmaking.(It is to be noted that EXP earned is halved when playing bot games)CONS-Cross-Platform without the option to disable. This is honestly my biggest issue with the game. There is a ""disable cross-play"" option in the game however it only functions in ranked, forcing me to play unranked with ps4 users on my team. Call me a PC elitist or whatever you'd like, but in my 44 hours of experience at the time of writing, 95% of afkers and leavers, as well as people with ping above 100 are ps4 players(spotted by the PSY Net profile picture) I would be willing to wait up to 5 times my normal wait times if it means I wont have someone leave or rubber band around the map at 900 ping.-ZERO penalty for leaving games. In Unranked you are free to join and leave games whenever you want, as often as you want, with no repurcussions. losing by 2? Screw it just leave. Have to pee? Just leave the game.-No option to disable joining in progress. Because there are no repurccussions for leaving games, you tend to join games in progress where your team is losing 7-0, luckily you can just leave without worry ;), but constantly leaving games I join with 30 seconds left down by 5+ pts get's annoying and has happened way more than I feel it should for how much I've played.-No Ranked Team-Play. You can join ranked games with your friends, but there is no ability to create a ranked team, and play with a roster of people. With the custom colors already implemented in the seasons mode it would be very easy to allow us to create teams, with a normal paint job and alternate in case the other team matches us, as well as pick our favorite map as home field, playing ranked 3v3's with my friends and our own custom colored cars and logos (also already implemented in seasons) would be fantastic. Less of a con and more of something that really should be put into the gameRECAP-I highly recommend this game, as it has clearly made it's way to the upper part of my playtime list and shows no sign of stopping. It's a game you can pick-up and just relax if you'd like but at the same time it's a game that can have you at the edge of your seat, butt clenched screaming at the top of your lungs as you score a goal with 0 seconds left to tie the game and put it into overtime, only to have the other team score at kick-off."

Non c'è molto da recensire, il gameplay è intuitivo e strutturato molto bene, sono presenti molte macchine (alcune a pagamento tramite dei DLC) oltre a diversi campi; disponibile anche la modalità Hockey su ghiaccio e Basketball. Si può giocare da un minimo di 1v1 ad un massimo di 4v4, sia competitivo sia for fun. La personalizzazione delle vetture è vastissima, cappellini, occhialini, scie di NOS, colori, bandierine e molto altro. Ho storto un po' il naso quando hanno introdotto le casse (1.49€ l'una) ma vabbè, resta comunque un titolo quasi perfetto.Io personalmente trovo Rocket League super competitivo, e come ogni gioco competitivo che si rispetti, partono santi ad ogni gol subito, specialmente se ci si ritrova in squadra gente che gioca totalmente a caso.

Well, someone did just that and came up with “Rocket League!”Turn on your engine and jump into a 2 vs 2, 3 vs 3 or even a 4 vs 4 online to score the goal of the season! It is just a mad house this game and I would strongly recommend to go through the tutorial to give you the heads up.Use your power up to pick up speed and launch your car into the air attempting a 360 degree frontward flip and strike this huge ball at the perfect angle to score a goal. But wait, your teammates are trying to do exactly the same thing and you all miss the ball! Now you have to drive back to defend your own net and hope that your opponents are as skilful as you are.You will accumulate points by scoring goals, clearing the balls, passing the ball in the centre, making an assist or, like myself, manage to do a hat trick. And to be honest, it was a fluke! Still, I managed to be the man of the match! Sorry, let me rephrase that - I managed to be the car of the match! These points will help you to unlock new cars, wheels, paints, hats(???). Yes hats and other stuff.The graphics are very good and the gameplay is fantastic. Great physics!One small downside is the frequent connection issue. I do not get kicked out of the game but keep missing out my goal of the season!Positives:~~~~~~~- Great graphics and physics- Easy to access an online game- Innovative and fun to play- Trading cards- AchievementsNegatives:~~~~~~~~- Frequent connection issueWhoever came up with this idea is a mad genius!10/10 (even with the connection issue)"

69,554.5,Not Recommended," May 24, 2016",15,"Update 1The new map ""Aqua Dome"" is incredibly resource-intensive: I usually play RL on fairly low settings without lags or framerate drops, but this map seems to require an enormously better hardware. It is constantly lagging and the framerate drop makes this map unplayable. I do not really see, why it was necessary to implement a map with significantly higher graphic requirements: Basically, I have to leave every other game.Update 2Same goes for Starbase ARC.Update 3You might have guessed it already: Same goes for the new Dropshot map. It performs slightly better than Aquadome.I absolutely enjoyed playing this game, for it has an interesting gameplay (soccer = cool, racing = cool, both combined = awesome).What I particularly dislike and what made it hard to be fun is the community, especially in 'Ranked' mode: Usually you end up with a special someone who enjoys ruining the other player's game and therefore their rank: Constantly crashing his teammate on purpose, scoring own goals, swearing or spamming. While you can report these people, all of them state, that they get reported 10 times/day and they do not have to face any consequences at all.If Psyonix solves this issue, playing will be fun again. If not, I will have to stick to teaming up with a steam friend who is not a total♥♥♥♥♥♥Offline/AI games are no alternative: The bots seem to be demanding enemies when you start playing, but soon, when you reach a certain skill level, they become rather unchallenging pushovers.Mir hat das Spiel immer sehr gefallen, es hat ein wirklich interessantes Gameplay (Fussball = cool, Autos = cool, beides zusammen = wahnsinnig gut).Was ich wirklich hasse und was meiner Meinung nach den Spaß versaut hat, ist die Community, besonders im ""Ranked"" Modus: Normalerweise wird man mit irendeinem Spezialisten gepaart, der es unglaublich toll findet den Anderen das Spiel und damit auch den Rank zu versauen: Dauerhaftes Rammen des Teamkollegen, Eigentore, Beleidigungen und Rumgespamme. Natürlich kann man die Leute inzwischen auch melden, aber nach Aussage dieser Leute, hat das selbst bei täglichen Meldungen keine Auswirkungen.Wenn Psyonix das irgendwie in den Griff bekommt, macht Spielen auch wieder Spaß. Wenn nicht, muss ich mit einem meiner Steamfreunde, die keine Idioten sind, zusammen spielen.Offline-Spiele gegen die KI sind auch keine wirkliche Alternative: Die Bots scheinen am Anfang wirklich hartnäckig zu sein, sobald man aber den Dreh raus hat, spielt man auch die ""Allstars""-Bots mit 8:0 an die Wand."
40,"1,327.8",Recommended," August 22, 2017",15,"This game is awesome. The one thing is that you have to be pacient. this game takes a long time to get good at. (I'm still pretty bad myself) I play this game pretty much every day and I never get bored.I can play with friends, either competitively or just for fun. In competitive mode, you can climb through ranks Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, and Champion, and if you make it through Champion you will become a Grand Champion. If I want to play for fun, I could get a big group together and make a private match using a bunch of different mutators and gamemodes, including ones we made up. If there's no one to play with, I can still just play solo or play any other mode with random people. If I don't feel like doing that and I just want to improve, I can play some of the many custom training packs made by people, or just play the ones made by Psyonix.Also this game has a level system. It goes Rookie (1-9) Semi-Pro (10-19) Pro (20-29) Veteran (30-39) Expert (40-49) Master (50-59) Legend (60-69) and Rocketeer (70-75)This game even goes beyond gameplay. The customization is pretty much endless, having decals, cars, wheels, boosts, trails, goal explosions, toppers, antenaes, and engine sounds. Also you can customize your car's colors for each team (Blue and orange). Also, certain items can come painted. This will change the color of it from the default, which you can use to your customization needs.There are just so many things to do in this game, and the community is great. Obviously there are some people who aren't so great, but I'm sure every game community has those people.In conclusion, I definitely recommend this game to anyone looking for a game to play competitively, play for fun, practice, collect items, climb through ranks, and maybe even become good enough to play in tournaments for prizes."

204,192.0,Recommended," August 11, 2015",4,"Its basically a football with cars. When you get in the game for the first time I suggest to play tutorial first so you can learn basics and advanced skills and then go into multiplayer 4 vs 4 CHAOS or 3 vs 3,2 vs 2 NORMAL and 1 vs 1 DUEL. When you played the round when you won or lost you get new items or a new car. You can customize your your car boost engine to for an example: snowflakes, sparkles and much more... You can customize your tires of the car and your antenna which can have your country on or other things like skull, heart, snowman and more... You can even put on the head of car for an example: a crown, taxi lighter and more...You can choose which color of the car you want. On the blue is green or blue or mixed, on the red its red or yellow or mixed together.From level 1-10 your ROOKIE, from level 10-20 your SEMI-PRO, from level 20-30 your PRO, from 30-40 your VETERAN, from 40-50 your EXPERT, from 50-60 your MASTER. And that means each time your level goes higher you will face more skilled player from multiplayer.The gameplay is simple, hit the ball in the goal, when your ingame you can pickup a small or big yellow things on the field which give you boost, with boost you can get fater to the goal before other enemy team shoot on it. But if your teammate shoots the ball almost to the goal, use the boost and go fast and shoot on the goal and win.My rate: 11/10Just like jacksepticeye said: SPEED IS KEEEEY!!!!EDIT: I love the new updates and DLCs, it makes you wanna play even more and im playing it since I did this whole review. Good job Psyonix!!!!!"
156,591.5,Recommended," September 7, 2015",4,"Every now and again I think about gaming and what games are like in a modern era, compared to its origins. Sometimes I ask myself ""What makes a game, a game?""A game's technical core needs to present the player with at least one thing: an objective - even if the objective is ""no objective"" (thanks for the philosophy lesson, Geddy Lee).Get A over to B. Navigate this character over terrain. Solve this puzzle.Or perhaps...Operate this rocket-powered car to drive and fly in order to hit a gigantic explosive ball into your opponent's net. Oh, and they'll be gunning for you.Rocket League is, by far, one of the best games of 2015. It's simple (easy to ""pick-up-and-go""), beautiful, sounds great, operates clean - and most importantly - fun. From the launch screen you are greeted with a rocket-car accompanied by some fun/energetic electronic music. Just by looking at the main screen you are able to devise the nature of the game. ""Oh, look. A freakin' rocket-car!""I used a Logitech USB gaming controller on my PC. It took a little tinkering to get my controls to be as PS4-like as possible; but after a few minutes I was ready to start playing.Finding online games is a sinch. You can choose between 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, and 4v4 (unranked). I would say the 3v3 is the ""standard"" gameplay, but I'm currently in love with 2v2. I would ask that any beginners heed my warning - that playing with random strangers may take a few games to find teammates that help you more than they hurt you. Sometimes you will get paired up with someone who will often miss shots, or even worse, knock the ball back into your goal. Sometimes that own-goaler is you! But worry not. Psyonix has developed ""quick chat"" commands to tell your teammate ""Sorry!"", ""Nice shot!"", or ""Great Pass!"" (among other phrases).This game is so ridiculously easy to pick up and play. It rings familiar to billiards. Step 1) Pick up stick. Step 2) Hit ball! The only difference here is the ""stick"" is a rocket-powered car in an arena where incredible feats of aerobatics are performed to hit a simple ball into a detonation-type net that explodes the ball.Something so simple shouldn't elevate my heartrate and cause so much joy, right? Surely there must be a law in the United States trying to regulate such a pleasure.While it's legal in your country I recommend picking up this game and getting as many ""fixes"" as you can.It is absolutely a blast."

This game is both for competitive and casual players as there is a casual and competitive ladder for 1v1, 2v2, 3v3. This game is highly skill based with regards to mechanics and game sense. The graphics in rocket league require a decent computer, but you can get 60fps on a low spec laptop/computer, but you will have to lower your graphic details.

It is very fun, and I'm constantly impressed by the devs, but it has its ups and downs like most competitive games.The GoodYou play soccer with carsThe cars have rocketsDevs are very dedicated to delivering new content, most of which is free (besides new cars)Seasonal in-game items for most major holidays (free)Pretty solid report and penalty system for toxic playersOption to hide loot boxesCross-play function with Xbox One<>PC<>Switch, and PC<>PS4Loot boxes ONLY contain cosmetic items; no pay to winThe BadSlightly more toxic community than other competitive gamesNo cross-platform party creation (yet?)Loot boxes (but contents are only cosmetic)You sit down intending to play for ten minutes, and you play for two hoursOne issue that I feel deserves some explanation: If the internet goes out during a ranked match, a temporary ban is handed out if the player can't reconnect in time. I understand this is for rage quitters, but I wish there was a reputation in place that allowed players who rarely get disconnected to do so without penalty. For example, I was playing one day and my net went out and came back on five minutes later. I couldn't reconnect to the match, and I was banned for ten mins. I'm wondering if there could be some sort of quarterly alotment of disconnects from ranked matches? Maybe something like, if records show that a player didn't disconnect from a ranked match for three months, don't ban them. If they've disconnected from ranked more than two or three in three months, give them a short ban, and ramp it up from there. Accidents happen, and I don't know that it's fair to place a ban on someone who didn't do anything wrong. Also, displaying this reputation system on player cards might help to fight toxicity.Another feature I would love to see is a solo standard mode for non-ranked.Those are my only two suggestions, and I've thoroughly enjoyed this game since its release on PS+.Finally, as mentioned before, the players have a tendency to be extremely toxic and narcissistic at times. You'll run into this in most games, but Rocket League seems bad at times. Psyonix has implimented a better reporting system, but unforunately, that only goes so far. It's the worst aspect of the game to me, besides the one time I got banned for my internet going out.Rocket League is a fun, competitive frankenstein of a game that combines soccer, hockey, basketball, driving, flying, and physics into a really fun package. It's easy to pick up and play for a short amount of time, and it's incredibly addicting. If you like any of the genres I mentioned, and if you can ignore toxic players, you should definitely buy this game."

104,59.1,Recommended," April 22, 2016",4,"Decided to try it out since it was a free weekend. I knew it would be good based on gameplay I'd seen and seeing the features it has. I was worried I'd get addicted, and I am. Bought it. Too late to turn back. Worth it.Visually, the game looks great. The particle effects, the stadiums, awesome job. You really get immersed into everything.The controls are very easy. Right now I'm using a mouse and keyboard. After a few hours straight of playing, my W, A, S, D fingers were sore (lots of movement in this game). I plan on trying the game out with a controller (which seems to be the popular way to go).Like other reviews say, it's a breeze to pick up but hard to master. But so far in only 3 hours of playing, I would say I can hold my own quite well. Been matched up against pros (there's ranks that will appear under names such as Rookie, Semi-Pro, Pro (I think it goes higher)) and I've been able to outmaneuver them. The game takes some patience. Setting up shots for your teammates, waiting for the right time to thrust in and hit the ball; not just driving crazy and hitting the ball just to hit it. If you're worried about how you play, there's tutorials and training you can go through. I haven't done any of that (I'd rather learn by diving straight into a match) and I turned out fine. But there's lots of help if you want to get better.As far as the DLC, I haven't bought any, but they look neat. The cosmetics and car types are very appealing and bring a fun element to the game. I have several thousand hours in TF2, so maybe I'm biased :P And you acquire some after matches, it's not like you have to go in and buy stuff, that's just the DLC that costs money. Everything else you get by playing the game, which I love.I highly recommend this game. You don't have to like cars or soccer to play this. It's just fun."

I was kinda amazed.Now for the gameplay.This is a fast and tactical game, despite all the chaos that will happen on the field.The controls are simple and easy to get used to just after a few games, but very hard to master.The goal of the game is to score a goal by wrestling with a GINORMOUS ball while fighting with your opponents and trying to coordinate with your team.The matches are fun and exciting, lasting from 6 to 10 minutes, depending on the amount of goals scored in the match.The customization is wild and rampart, with the cars having the same ""stats"", except the minor hitbox changes.There are several game-modes, and if you're familiar with the FIFA or Pro Evolution Soccer games, you will understand what they are.You have the Exhibition game mode where you play ONE match with your adjustable settings.You have the Season game mode consisting of multiple matches that follow a basic tournament format.And you have the Play Online mode (currently down on 7.7.15, the launch day) that has Unranked and Ranked game modes.If you are a fan of fun, this is a game for you."

629,681.8,Recommended," July 14, 2016",4,"Rocket League is a surprisingly great idea that was executed very well. I've been playing the game on and off since its launch and it has been quite interesting to see its evolution. At first, most of the newcomers who hadn't played in the beta or the previous title were quite terrible and that included me too. We were content with just hitting the ball, then we learned hitting the ball effectively with boost and flips. It took longer but we reached the skies eventually, learning to control the vehicles in mid-air and scoring aerial goals.It's not just a game of skill, it requires quite a bit of thinking and mental awareness. You need to be aware of where the ball is, where it will go to and how it might bounce, but then you also need to be aware of your opponents, your teammates, what they might do and if they're capable of doing it. It doesn't hurt to know what you can pull off as well.Overall, I've found Rocket League engaging enough to play for 450+ hours and I don't regret it. Even though the game can sometimes make you rage, the core mechanics are so solid that you will likely return once it has had a chance hook you."

It is insanely fun! Different game modes, TONS of customization (one new item unlocked each match, win or lose), and WAAAAAAY more entertaining than I EVER would have expected.As someone who adamantly requires a decent story to commit to a game, I give Rocket League a 10/10.

2,571.4,Recommended," April 22, 2016",7,"If you like arcadey driving games, simple sports games, and playing against your friends, Rocket League could become your next online addiction. Essentially soccer with cars and a giant ball, this game has you drive around an enclosed arena, bumping into other players as you try to knock the ball into the goal. But in keeping with the arcade spirit, the physics are a bit on the unrealistic side, which is why your car can hop up and twist, you can drive up the sides of walls, and head-on crashes only cause you to bounce back (though, admittedly, the physics may be too unbelievable for those looking for a real athletic challenge). You also can play matches up to four-on-four, either online, via split-screen, or in a mix of the two, though the more populated matches tend to be a bit too chaotic. There's even an exhibition mode where you can play against the computer, and these matches also go up to four-on-four, though this gets old pretty quickly -- well, unless you customize your car with a pirate flag, purple boost smoke, and a sombrero.

65,814.1,Not Recommended, April 14,4,"toxic players will talk sh*t to you but if you talk sh*t back you might get banned for saying one of the company's trigger words. i believe the company's own statement is certain racial slurs for example but as far as i know they haven't released a full list of words, and their thresholds, that will get you banned. love that double standard, you can be toxic and troll all you want just don't cross a certain line in your speech apparently, the majority of the players aren't toxic and don't talk sh*t to you but they are out there. even more ironic this company is trying to be 'ethical' considering they're selling mafia style gambling tactics to sell microtransactions to people and most likely even minors are gambling with the money they have who play this game. buy some overpriced keys and you MIGHT get the item you REALLY want, just spin the wheel! or you might just waste your key you spent $1.50 on for some decal you don't like.needs to be consumer rights passed into legislation, if not already, so people can sue the f*ck out of companies like this that rescind the product you paid for and don't refund you full price that you paid if they ban you for not abiding by their arbitrary speech codes, and could've been after someone just called you an idiot, told you to f*ck off and to kys, told you you're trash, told you to uninstall the game and called your mom a dog. Those insults of course might not make it on the company's list as bannable offenses so reporting them would be useless anyways and it's just amazing seeing corporations like this trying to seem virtuous by calling for these inconsistent speech codes, as if there isn't all sorts of horrible things you can say to someone that doesn't involve race or whatever other subjectively offensive speech they've made 'taboo' on their list. Anyone saying 'just hit the mute button' doesn't get it, if someone is talking trash to me and takes it to that level then i'm going to talk trash back to them and say whatever trash talk i want in a game i paid for the same way i do anywhere else in the real world, it's the principal that companies can get away with allowing only certain trash talk but once you say one of their trigger words on their list then YOU are the one that gets banned. other than those things the game is certainly fun and i would recommend the game if you don't care about toxic players here and there or the semi-retar*ed banning practice and gambling microtransactions this company practices."
459,578.6,Not Recommended," February 11, 2017",53,"I would recommend this game, but there's a lot of annoying things that come with it.The Community.Oh the community in this game. Have you ever played CSGO? Yeah, it's like that but from what I've experienced it's worse.You'll get called out for being a crappier teammate quicker and more frequently, even though what counts to having a good teammate is yourself. I mean this by the fact that Doubles more-so than Standard is like marriage; it either works, or it doesn't.You can't simply have 2 people playing in the exact same way, otherwise you won't accomplish anything. But you'll get called out on it because your teammate is nothing other than a sore loser. It's nobodies fault that you were paired with someone who has the same playstyle and isn't compatible when it comes to Doubles. Kidding, it's your fault, YOU suck, YOU are the problem. (Sarcasm, if you missed it).I wish the developers put as much work into the game when it comes to dealing with the community, rather than focusing it on more DLC and maps that nobody truely asked for. Sure, some of the maps are good, but when a lot of them suck it's not helped by the fact you're limited to a preference-based system which seems more like a placebo effect.The DLC isn't anything special, the cars are just from other games they pair up with to make DLC in the game and the most annoying difference is that the other game who makes the DLC on Rocket League usually supplies their DLC for free.Though, I don't mind, I wouldn't be using the DLC anyway. The only point to DLC that I see is to support the developers, but I can't support the developers in such a way when they can't fix the simple things instead of the half-arsed features that deal with disruptive players.The report feature is good (not really), but for what good it does I might as well just not bother playing if I'm looking to enjoy the game which is hard to do when you're put with people that come across as if they grief regularly. The bans are pretty lax, which is a shame because a lot of players that do cause problems are the ones that pick up and play for 20 minutes at a time maybe, then come back 1-2 days later giving plenty of time for a ban to wear off. There's no real reason to care about being banned for griefing in this game. Hell, I've griefed a few times to put it to the test, but I've never seen a ban come from it.Ranked feels simplistic and, again, half-arsed. Sure, it may function, but it's hardly anything special. Matches still seem to go off a hidden point system, for example; you win, you rank up but the next match you lose you rank down. So here's the problem, at a lot of ranks you can experience the same skill level of players, and that doesn't work so well when you're trying to rank up to what 'should' be considered a good rank. See in CSGO, MGE or DMG is about the average. You can feel the difference to being Nova 2 as opposed to DMG, but in Rocket League Prospect 3 is pretty much the same as Challenger 3, only you can use that 'rank' to stroke your ego when insulting your teammates and such.All in all, I can't recommend this game. It's not fun anymore and it's dragged down mostly by the community, and the features needed for it to be fun are non-existant even after almost 2 years of it's release.Eventually I'd like to see that bans aren't as lax and the ranked system is better along with the report system. It was good for the first 2 seasons, but it seems the developers couldn't keep up with the increase in players and more so the toxic ones.Hopefully all the money earned from eSports and the DLC will go towards improving the issues aforementioned."

If people are dumb enough to buy cosmetics for a game they already paid money for, that's fine by me.However, after a year long break, I've returned to the single most toxic experience i've ever had in all of gaming.In ranked 2v2, your teammate votes to forfeit at the tender score of 0-1.They call you♥♥♥♥♥♥when really you're the one doing all the work.You can be winning 6-4 and then your teammate decides to join the other team after throwing abuse at you all match.You can mute them, but that seems unfair to the actually genuinely nice people on there.Reporting♥♥♥♥♥♥players does nothing either.I cannot recommend this game anymore.EDIT: I came back at the start of a competitive season, and over 70% of the people i played with were awful. now its more like 10%, quite far into the season, so I assume they got mad they were getting nowhere and went back to playing FIFA. I wish there was an option in the middle of yes and no, because that's what i'd choose. Very well put together game (with lagspikes twice per match), but the toxicity makes it a lot less fun."

When you have a team working together it is a thing of beauty. You might be helping out on offense alot one game, while another player might be making some great saves coming back on defense, or you all might do a little of everything, etc..

Add water, oil, and salt. Mix.- Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs, water, oil, and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed.- Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough.- Take the dough out of the mixing bowl, shape it into a ball, and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic.- Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick, or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters.- With a cookie cutter or upside-down water glass, cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15-20 dough circles).- Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis, or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn’t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor.Fill the Ravioli shells.- Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough.- Fill a small bowl with water, dip your fingers in, and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle.- Fold the dough in half over the filling, making a half-moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a “homemade” touch as well.- Repeat this process for all your dough circles.- Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together.Form the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker.- Roll the dough into two sheets- Place one sheet on the ravioli maker, and form the filling cups.- Fill with the ravioli mixture.- Lay the second sheet of dough on top, and roll it out. This will seal in the filling.- Remove and separate the finished raviolis.Cook the Ravioli.- Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil.- Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5-6 minutes, or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test.- If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time, you can freeze the rest- Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed platesServe it up.Top with your favorite sauce, grate some fresh cheese over it, and enjoy!"

1,348.2,Recommended," July 11, 2015",5,"Not much of an review, just a warm recommendationstraight from my heart.---RECOMMENDATION---Rocket League is a football/soccer game,with Nitro-Cars.This is a football/racing game, where each team startsat their respective sides on the field, and the ballis dead dropped in the middle, and the goal,is obvious, scoring goals. Each round is set to5 minutes, if the score is set to draw at the endof the clock, you go to overtime, and the first teamto score wins.Might not sound that fun, neither thought I whenI first saw this game popping up at Steam.But when I started playing it, it was a whole differentthing. This game is freaking addictive, fun and competitive,and just blew me away.Rocket League is developed by Psyonix. Not the mostknown developer team, but they do have some experience,mainly developing Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Carson Ps3 and Co-Developing Unreal Tournament 2004 with Epic Games.And that shows, as the core mechanics are tight and precise.The Nitro-cars can use boostersyou fill up by driving over glowing circles around the field,you can double-jump and do trick-shots, and it's sosatisfying to score goals, doing that one insane trick-jump thatjust manages to nudge that ball into the goal, then watch the gloryin replay. Teamplay is important in this game,having a team mate passing the ball just right so you canboost in and do a trick-jump and score.The game is also fair, as there's no bs perks or unlockableitems that can give you an advantage in the match.The unlockables are straight visual changes, as well as the cars youunlock throughout the game. So everyone is playing onequal terms, and it's skills and team play that will determinethe winner.You can either play against Bots in customs matches,or seasons mode where you'll play in a leaguespanning over a set number of weeks.The bots are pretty good at Pro difficulty.At rookie they're too easy and dumb, so playingat Pro is the sweet spot between useless andunfair.If you're after some more intellectual opponents,head over to the multiplayer.This game supports 2, 3 and 4 player split-screenfor playing with friends.If split-screen ain't your cup of tea, no problem,this game features Match Making and Dedicated Servers.Set up a private lobby with your friends or play againstrandom people. This game features 1vs1, 2vs2, 3vs3 and 4vs4matches.Currently this game has a pretty large player-base for an indie game,and that's thanks to Cross-Platform play between PC and Ps4.The graphics are splendid, colourful and visually exciting, so nothingto complain about here.I really don't have much of any complaints regarding this game,tho some might feel as there's little content in this game,with there only being one game modeand no performance-enchanting upgrades for your cars, but,in my opinion, that's what makes this game great, everyone isplaying on equal terms, and the core mechanics in my opinion,is so fun and addictive that it doesn't really need more gamemodes to satisfy me.If you're a person who appreciates these types of games, this onemight be perfect for you, either you just want to casually playalone or with friends, or take it up to a competitive level, this gamejust works, and will give me many many hours of funentertainment.I strongly recommend this game for anyone wanting to trysomething different and looking for either casual funor competitive play either against bots or online.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------For more reviews and recommendations, please visit"

256,284.2,Recommended," June 29, 2016",5,"Basic InformationTitle : Rocket LeagueDeveloper : PsyonixPublisher : PsyonixGenre : RacingGeneral ImpresionRocket League's gameplay is largely the same as that of its predecessor Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars. Players control a rocket-powered car and use it to hit a ball that is much larger than the cars towards the other team's goal area to score points, in a way that resembles a soccer game, with elements reminiscent of a demolition derby. Players cars have the ability to jump to hit the ball while in mid-air. The players can also pick up a speed boost by passing their cars over marked spaces on the field, enabling them to quickly cross the field, use the added momentum to hit the ball, or ram into another player's car to destroy it; in the latter case, the destroyed car respawns moments later. A player may also utilize boost when in the air to propel themselves forward in flight, allowing players to hit the ball in the air. Players can also perform quick dodges, causing their car to do a short jump and spin in a given direction, which can be used to nudge the ball or gain positioning advantage over the other team.Matches are typically five minutes long, with a sudden death overtime if the game is tied at that point. Players are awarded points for certain actions in the game, such as scoring a goal, assisting in a goal, centering the ball, shooting the ball close to goal, saving a ball from going into a goal, or winning the game. These points contribute towards a meta-game experience system, unlocking decorative rewards for players to personalize their cars which include: Rocket trails, Toppers, Antennas, Decals, Car Bodies, and Wheels. Matches can be played from between one-on-one up to four-on-four players as well as casual and ranked.The game includes a DLCs pack that can offer you more customization for the car. In my opinion, Rocket League is the best soccer/racing game that I ever played in my life.+ Great optimization+ Great ranking system+ Great graphics+ Car costumization+ Fast loading screen+ Achievements+ Steam Trading Cards- Pretty expensive- Too many DLCs"

140,549.6,Recommended," August 28, 2017",36,"TL;DR buy it, but dont play with ps4 kidsRocket League is an amazing sports game. It's a game that you can either pick up every once in a while or play it religiously. Sure, at the beginning of the game there is a bit of a grind to get all of the default cars/decals/etc, and there are many other items available through crates, events and DLC. The community is okay (there are some toxic players, but many players in this game are pretty nice) but make sure to always have a teammate to queue up with. The rank system is kinda messed up, as it could take multiple games to division up but then you could lose that division with just 1 loss. Also, there is a new ban system for blacklisted words! Most other PC players don't care, but PS4 and Xbox kids probably will report you for anything that their mommies don't wanna see on their screen.OVERALL a very good game, I would recommend it to:-casual gamers-competitive gamers-people who like sports/cars/action-people who are ready to have their life sucked into the black hole that is Rocket League:)"

338,"1,429.0",Recommended," October 13, 2015",2,"At 1200+ hours, I hardly get tilt any more. You simply accept that there are people you will never catch up, people that have less hours than you but quick at learning this game, people that trash talk plays better than you, and people that are just in there to troll other players. Like in life, anything that can happen in this virtual world allowed by the rules or inputs from people control the cars or keyboard could happen.But, why do I still keep playing and practicing? I will never be able to find a team that plays when I have time, I won't be able to play when they have time either. There is that upper skill level cap solo queuing.Because it's just so damn deep, and everytime you improved in skills, the game opened up more and more of it's possibilities. Even if that means witness an awesome team play going into your goal and you might derank. You won't see that if you never put in time or not super talented. I'm not pro players, not even remotely close. But been playing since the game launches, it's just such a journey thinking back.Probably no one will ever see this review, but hey, I'm still playing.Rocket League is a simple but great well made game!=============Old review below ==========================This game is made up of 3 ingredients: endorphin, adrenaline and salt.Edit: Closing in on 600h, first review update. This is still my favorite game and it saves me a lot of money. ie. Game XXX go on sale, super hyped AAA game YYY launched next week with 10/10 review. And what goes through my head is, ""well, I can wait next sale or become cheaper, cause I will be playing Rocket League anyway."" I think besides VR games, I've only bought Alienation on PS4, but it is a loot grinding game, kinda of not what I expected from Housemarque. Right now I'm working on improving car controls and pretty much leveling up all aspects of mechanic, wall challenge, possession control, passing etc. There is less salt and adrenaline involved now, to me Rocket League now become a super fast pacing ""status analysis"" game, you constantly evaluate situations, both enemy and team mates, you try to be consistent at what you do, but not too predictable facing enemy challenge. It's like a 4 or 6 players team smash game where everything and anything could happen in the stadium.For newer player though, don't get frustrated or discouraged. No one play that good from day one. Just like any other game, there are some really talented guy that will ""get it"" and be able to do whatever they like cause either they are young and brain adapt new things faster, or they have other games that trains their reflex/muscle so it's easier to transition to this game. Just aiming to ""have fun"", all the efforts you make to improve your skill is to enjoy more fun when engage other players online. Yes, there will be trolls and toxic players, who cares? At 600 hours, I just laugh at those flaming/troll comments, it's just those few games in the thousands of matches. Bad player will exists if Rocket League is popular, cause everyone will face against someone better eventually, you could be matched with team mate less skilled than you do. And if everything isn't going your way, before venting/ranting on your team mates, think about ""having fun"" and work on getting better while the more skillful player is present. You can only improve playing with people that are better than you, observe and think what you are missing from replays, and practice, practice, practice even more until you can also do those♥♥♥♥♥♥they do without thinking or brain go blank. :)"

33,782.5,Recommended," December 28, 2015",2,"Psyonix is the BEST developer ever. The game is only $20 to begin with. The DLC are like $3 each and are COMPLETELY optional. The cars added through DLC are just cosmetic and give the players no advantage over others who dont have the DLC (AKA super balanced gameplay). Overall the gameplay is easy to learn YET VERY HARD TO MASTER. This game is super addictive and I can't see myself putting it down in the foreseeable future. My friends and I are moving up through the ranked leagues and although it may seem like a grind, every match is enjoyable. The car customization, cross platform play, splitscreen multiplayer, mutators, and frequent updates are some added benefits that make this game great.Must have game IMO."

That would be great! The gameplay is fun, except for the fact that you can easily get ranked with people with hundreds of hours more than you and way better.

24,992.3,Recommended," November 25, 2016",2,"I. Love. This. Game.I played this game at first a couple days after it's release, when my brother bought it and showed it too me. At first I thought, ""ok cool, it's a game about cars and soccer, whatever."" but it's so much more than that. I picked the game back up a couple months later and played it through my brothers account. I played it non-stop for a few days, but then forgot about it after a bit. After a few months of hiatus from the game, a friend showed me a clip of Kronovi air dribbling into the goal. My immediate reaction was ""YOU CAN DO THAT??"" And yes, you can. Anyone can. And that's the beauty of this game. It's really just a cool game when you look at it at first, but once you realize you can actually get good at the game, you won't be able to stop playing. Anyone can get good at this game, all you need is to put in the time and effort. And man, once you land that aerial, is it rewarding. Not only is the reward of successfully pulling off a trickshot an amazing feeling but the whole journey to get to the point where you can do it is fun (although there are some rough late nights where you just want to win one single game). This is exactly what I started doing, and have been doing, since I saw that air dribble. I recently bought the game for myself instead of playing it through family sharing, because once I had money I was absolutely ecstatic to be able to support the developers.Buy. This. Game. I have NEVER played a better game. Rocket League knows what it needs to do, and does it so well. It never misses a beat, the developers are really good at listening to their community (which is amazing and incredibly kind by the way) and there's really not a single thing I'd change about the game."

The core gameplay and physics will make it so there will always be something new added to the table. You actually have to play this game over a long period of time to even be considered remotely good. tl;dr: You're always learning and there's always something new.What coule be improved:-It has an amazing soundtrack....how come we don't have the option to play that awesome music DURING our matches?-Saving car profiles. I'm that guy who changes the way his car looks every other day...I'd love to be able to save/load car profiles for my Tuesday ownage :]-Saved replays can only be replayed with the game running...I'm not knocking the game (I do have a capture card for recording purposes) too much, but many people won't have the option to share their matches unless they have a capture tool--as the raw video footage file is NOT saved locally.Other than that, this was the best $20 I've ever spent.

The community is exceptonal (for the most part ;) ) and willing to help on Reddit ( https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeague ) or here on Steam. You can join players from all around the world including PS4 and Xbox One players alike. So far I really enjoyed most of my hours (except for the occasional quitters and ballchasers) and I think this game delivers on all of its promises. Its main source of playerbase is probably how Gif-able it really is, you could see it constantly appearing on the front page of reddit. For anyone that likes football (/soccer) and for those who don't too (including myself) this is 20€- or less when on sale- well spent."

28,906.6,Recommended," October 17, 2016",2,"One of the best games I have ever played!This game is completely revolutionizing. While the idea might seem stupid in the eyes of an obserever, I assure you, it is incredibly fun.The game has mostly great qualities including but not limited to:- Worldwide dedicated servers with low latency.- A fun and engaging community- Developers who are constantly changing and tweaking the game to the better.- Constant creation of DLCs that are cool, but not necessary for victory. (Essentially, not pay to win)And the most important:- Easy to learn, hard to master.I have played this game for more than 400 hours and I am still improving. You might get frustrated at the beggining, but the reward is worth it. It took me more than 50 hours to be able to hit the ball in the air.I recommend this game for all who love fast-paced action and having fun.Definately worth $20"

24,992.3,Recommended," November 25, 2016",2,"I. Love. This. Game.I played this game at first a couple days after it's release, when my brother bought it and showed it too me. At first I thought, ""ok cool, it's a game about cars and soccer, whatever."" but it's so much more than that. I picked the game back up a couple months later and played it through my brothers account. I played it non-stop for a few days, but then forgot about it after a bit. After a few months of hiatus from the game, a friend showed me a clip of Kronovi air dribbling into the goal. My immediate reaction was ""YOU CAN DO THAT??"" And yes, you can. Anyone can. And that's the beauty of this game. It's really just a cool game when you look at it at first, but once you realize you can actually get good at the game, you won't be able to stop playing. Anyone can get good at this game, all you need is to put in the time and effort. And man, once you land that aerial, is it rewarding. Not only is the reward of successfully pulling off a trickshot an amazing feeling but the whole journey to get to the point where you can do it is fun (although there are some rough late nights where you just want to win one single game). This is exactly what I started doing, and have been doing, since I saw that air dribble. I recently bought the game for myself instead of playing it through family sharing, because once I had money I was absolutely ecstatic to be able to support the developers.Buy. This. Game. I have NEVER played a better game. Rocket League knows what it needs to do, and does it so well. It never misses a beat, the developers are really good at listening to their community (which is amazing and incredibly kind by the way) and there's really not a single thing I'd change about the game."

148,18.3,Recommended," June 17, 2016",2,"Rocket League is most commonly known for ""playing soccer with cars"". It may sound boring, but it isn't. Rocket League has more gamemodes. All gamemodes include Soccer, Basketball and Hockey. It also includes a DIY car which includes the type of car, the hat, the wheels, the boost trails, etc... The colors can be related to the colors Blue and Orange. Then there is a secondary color that you can choose. You can also choose what you want the paint to look like such as Mettalic, BatMobile (DLC), Wood (DLC) and so much more! There are so many achievements to get. You can have Seasons which help you grind some XP for levels. You unlock more items the more you play such as hats, boost trails, etc... You can also play with friends in a team or against each other. The game also includes some sweet tunes to keep you occupied on the main menu screen!Over all, Rocket League is a really good game and I HIGHLY reccoment people to buy it."
57,537.6,Recommended," October 7, 2017",2,"Rocketleague is incredibly fun with a simple concept.For me, it runs very well on 70FPS and looks pretty.Only internet laggs can be annoying here and there,but thats not too often and probably the fault of myinternet connection a lot of the times.You have a ton of customization-optionsfor your car, with hats, antennas, decals,special paints, trails, soundeffects and more.Updates come regularily and are all free.Here and there they add small dlcs with one to 3cars and some decals, but nothing game changing.!!BUT!! this game can be very frustrating when playing ranked!There is a whole lot of toxic players that just want to insult youor annoy you with stupid comments like ""ez"" even if they play♥♥♥♥♥♥. It can really annoy the hell out of you. On top of that,matches can be really random and luck based, and rankingup gets harder and harder the better you play. Even thoughits a fun and intense challenge to play ranked, don't let it getto you as it demotivates and frustrates a lot of times.Thats the biggest ""problem with the game"".Just play for fun and see it as a challenge.Also: Trading is a really important part in this game.Instead of buying keys to open crates, I recommendgoing in the Steam community guides and discussionsand offering the crates you have earned through playingfor keys or items. You can basically get every crate itemyou want just by trading with others. Be fair thoughand check price lists, and be aware of scammers!All in all, this game was worth every cent as it never getsboring. There is always time for a quick match ^^Just don't let the ranks get to you! x)"

74,81.6,Recommended," August 28, 2016",2,"Hey Guys,It has been awhile since I have written my last review, but that is beside the point. Today I would like to express how I feel about this game that has influenced the creation of cross-platform gaming. I believe this is one of the best cross-platforming games out there. It brings together people from console to PC (PC MASTER RACE!).The concept of the game is very unique...Not.There was a game I remember playing about 7 years that was the bae, but glitchy as my mom on steriods. Just the feeling of sucker-punching that big ball right into that net, NEVER BETTER. Also, I adore the fact that you can put hats on your car, AND THEY DONT COST MONEY. SUCK ON THAT TF2.Overall, this game is off the chains...get it...off the ch-nevermind...A-Anyway this game is great because of all of it's elements.Thank you for wasting your time, reading another review that you will not think is helpful.Guess what...I DON'T GIVE A HEBIE A-JEBIES."

113,468.9,Recommended," June 21, 2017",2,"Rocket League is a game about hitting an over sized soccer ball with a car.It's also really good.Two teams sized from 1 to 4 cars depending on what mode you're playing battle it out in a good ol' game of soc-car. Each car is customizable in many ways ranging from hats to color of nitro boost. Each car can get even more choices to pick from opening crates for $1, which has a small chance of landing on a super rare mystery universal decal, which can be used on any car (more common than an unusual from tf2 or knife from cs:go.) Cross network play from the console versions of the game is available as well.The micro transactions are never pushed in your face, only when you try to open a crate (their intended purpose) and when you click on showroom on the menu (used to be worse)Savage!/10"
241,18.3,Recommended," July 11, 2016",2,"Rocket League is an interesting, I want to say rocket powered radio controlled vehicle, sports game. You, the player, are placed in control of a vehicle inside a large arena with either AI opponents or online through matchmaking publicly or privately. From there you either play one of three sports of hockey, basketball, or the popular soccer matches. Throughout your match you gain rocket boosts to assist with speed, aerial maneuvers, or flat out blowing up your opponents to somehow score a point in their goals. This game has quickly gained a following and the more time you invest the more goodies you unlock to decorate your vehicles; whether they be paint, decals, rims, antennas, rocket effects or car bodies. Special vehicle bodies can also be purchased through the games microtransaction page.Pros:- The game does have an addicting play style to keep you coming back.- Large community so games are quickly formed.- Plenty of accessories to make your vehicle stand out.- Experience points can be earned offline and online.- Game offers its own voice chat, great for PC players.- Cross-platform between PC and Playstation Network.- Soundtrack is great if you're into more of techno, dubstep.Cons:- Matchmaking could use work, especially for new players being matched against pros/veterans.- Aerial maneuvers can be tricky to master.- When players do drop out of matches they receive no penalty. Sometimes it just sucks seeing your teammates give up.- Expect players to be ball hogs or just flat out not care where they hit the ball.- Blowing up opponents. (To me this feature is great for defensive reasons, but some players take it upon themselves to whine during the match to quit blowing them up. It's part of the game, get over it.)Rocket League is still a fun game with hours of game play to offer. Just keep in mind, it offers the online competitiveness so expect some players to play poorly, intense, or like complete jerks. Playing with friends will obviously alter all of that, though. I still recommend this title as I'm sure more updates are in the near future and maybe another sport will be introduced to the roster."

199,887.1,Recommended, January 3,2,"When I’m playing well it’s a great time waster, when I’m playing bad, it’s just a time waster. This is Rocket League in a nutshell for me. Easy to play, extremely hard to master! I’m a competitive person and this soothes all my competitive needs, with the added option for a more relaxed game too.Just one more game...said no one ever."
2,2.0,Recommended," August 27, 2015",9,"Rocket League is a crazy blend of soccer (or football depending on where you live) and RC cars.The basic idea of the game is very basic - use your car to poke the ball into opponent's gates.You'd think this might be awkward with RC cars physics, but that's actually not the case. From my point of view, this game has some of the most polished and balanced ""fun physics"" model I'd seen lately.You have pretty much absolute control over your car and it's movements (well, aside from times when you are flying). Which means that it's quite easy to control the ball (if you are not terrible as I am).In addition to basic RC car controls you have an ability to (double) jump and boost (which can also be used to propel yourself to the sky).You can also use your car to push other cars away from the ball. And if you have enough speed - you can blow enemies up (can be achieved by using boost boost).There are also some cosmetic customizations, different car bodies, tires and stuff like this.So, it all comes down to the question - does poking the ball and high speeds towards gates sounds compelling to you? If yes - grab this game, it's pretty awesome. If not - well, it's not for you, go get something you'll enjoy.I have to also note that I'm not exactly a huge fan of soccer. But I had an absolute blast playing Rocket League.Oh, and there's also split-screen support.I have not noticed any issues or problems with the game during my playtime.More detailed look in the video:"

Rocket League came out and was truly unique, fun and very easy to learn, whether you enjoy the casual games with friends or the competitive ranking system Rocket League does provide for all. The key is Psyonix, Inc. was able to do something different and make an impact on the industry. They didn't have to clone or copy any other game, they created their own gem in the gaming market."

Let the mind-games commence!Most of the cosmetics are in-game unlockable (but even the purchased DLC is fairly priced, in my opinion.)Exciting, FREE, new content every few months. (Mutators, Hockey, Basketball)Seemingly endless replay-ability.Cross-platform play let's you play against console peasants players!Easy to save and view replays, and spectate matches.Neutral:Can only communicate to console players using quick chat. They don't see anything you type.Crate system: I'm on the fence for this feature. I do enjoy the excitement of getting crates, and it also incentivises players to finish matches when they might have just rage quite previously. But you do feel like they are milking you for cash. That being said, they only give you cosmetics, so it's not like you need to buy keys."

After over 2k hours on Xbox and the quality of the Xbox port decreasing I decided to take the plunge and fork out for a PC, leaving 10+ years of tenure on Xbox Live in my wake but it was all worth it.Rocket League is quite simply football, but with rocket-powered cars.From Bronze I all the way up the ranks to Grand Champion Rocket League is a blast. It's high octane gameplay and 5 minute games make it a very addictive game to get into and eventually envelope yourself in. On the surface Rocket League is a very simple game with very simple mechanic, however these basic mechanics allow for an incredible amount of depth.Grab a beer, grab some friends, jump into some games and be prepared for a bunch of laughs and a hell of a good time. I can't recommend this game enough, a must-buy for any gamer of any skill-level."
122,925.5,Recommended," December 2, 2016",2,"Wow. What an incredible masterpiece from Psyonix. I can't say enough positive things about this game.First of all, their development team is impressively active and will reply to the community in a very quick time about questions/bugs and whatnot.Secondly, the game is fun for all skill levels. I had a blast when I first started out even though I was utter garbage. Now that I have over 500 hours in my belt, I have improved dramatically but still have so far to go.Finally, I have made several friends from this game that I would not have made any other way. For the most part, the community is friendly.Thanks Psyonix :')"
248,12.6,Recommended," July 18, 2015",2,"This game is very unique. I've never seen such a weird combination but it makes such an awesome and entertaining experience! The matches can feel really competitive with 1v1's, 2v2's, 3v3's, and even 4v4's! With every goal comes satisfaction. I can't believe how polished it is and how well it runs. The price is great and worth every pennie. The game seems to get a little repetitive after about 10 matches, but only when you are playing by yourself online. With friends everything changes and just having friends to play with makes the experience so much better. The game even supports 2 player splitscreen which we barely ever see on PC. I plan to put many hours into this game!"

252,17.3,Recommended," January 14, 2016",2,"I'm usually bad at sport games that involve scoring touchdowns or goals but this game to me is a lot more fun than playing any other football, soccer, or hockey game.This is basically like playing soccer or hockey but with cars. You can even temporarily blow up other cars if you ram into them at a fast enough speed so in that way it's like tackling someone in football.Well, enough with the analogies. While I usually quit most sports games after I try them out soon after, Rocket League takes very little investment of your time. You can queue solo or with 1, 2, or 3 other friends for a game that could be as little as 5 minutes long, This means you're not stuck in a long 3 period or 4 quarter game if you're not looking for such a big investment of your time.This also means you're less likely to get frustrated because of how quick match making actually is. Sure you might lose but you might also end up doing a game where you go like 9 goals to their 1 which for example happened to me yesterday.Because matches are so fast, the highs and lows come along much more quickly. You're less likely to dwell on a bad game because you don't have to wait long for the chance to redeem your loss.So in conclusion, I like this game. Ask your friends that play it what they think of it if you have any that own it. Watch some videos of people playing it on YouTube. Then, make your decision whether you want to play or not.Heavily recommended."

565,"1,637.5",Recommended," December 3, 2015",2,"This is a celebratory review for Rocket League as it just won Best Sports/Racing Game and Best INDIE GAME OF THE YEAR!Fully deserved. I've played competative games throughout my whole life and Rocket League tops them all in almost every aspect. It's consistently updated and patched. The developers not only communicate but they also play with you! (gg, T-Bull ;). The controls are tight, responsive yet complex with plenty of room for a proper learning curve. The gameplay is simple with incredible room for growth.Best yet, it's fun to watch! Rocket League is already in the MLG with teams signing up left and right. Cross-play between PC and PS4 (and soon Xbone) so online play is never stale. They doubled the amount of servers worldwide due to demand.My personal favorite aspect (other than hitting an amazing shot) is that the matches are short. 5-7 minutes long with far more action than you'll see in most other esports. It's quick, it's fun, it's ROCKET LEAGUE!Wow!"

330,107.2,Recommended," July 17, 2015",2,"TL;DR Rocket League is awesome, no microtransactions, great gameplay, awesome graphics, re-playability, and cross platform multiplayer. Needs a controller. Good for 20$ but if you are willing to wait for a sale go for it.So my review i will try and leave it short and simple.I used to play Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle Cars on PS3 when it came out and they really re-delivered a solid experience for Steam and PS4. I do highly recommend a controller for it because the keyboard controls are super clunky. The best one at the best price is a Logitech F310 which is like 15$ right now i believe on Amazon. Anyway, The game is fluent and runs fantastic on practically any PC. The cross-platform multiplayer sets up for some amazing competition especially in ranked. The hats, trails, cars, and decals are all unlockable and not microtransactioned at all which i personally thought was fantastic. There is no advantage to having a minivan or a truck compared to the hotrod and lamborghini bodies for your vehicle. The game is entirely skill based and has a great tutorial and many great training exercises.All in all for a 20$ price tag it is worth it in my eyes, but to most people i would say wait for a sale or at least watch some videos on it."

146,157.4,Recommended," August 2, 2015",2,"Easily the best fast paced competitive game right now. The thrills and epic moments just keep coming. Soccer with rocket powered cars sounds silly but the game takes itself very seriously. It's all about learning to better control your car and the ball. Eventually you will descover you can fly if you use your booster right and will be doing crazy airborn trick shots at the goal from half way down the field with your car spinning through the air.Well teamwork is more important then that, but not as cool :)"

Although I haven't had much time to play it lately, I still think about playing it whenever winter breaks comes. Seriously. One of the best games I have ever played.This game is absolutely fun, even if you don't like sports (like me). Especially with the latest update (called Rumble, which introduces Mario-Kart-esque power-ups), this game can easily appeal to a very wide audience.Basically, it's soccer with cars, but it has so much potential for really great, funny moments, as well as several modes (including hockey, basketball, and Rumble).

Just like L4D this game has allowed me to meet some good guys and girls that are now in my friends list. But like any online game there are as many jerks as there is good. The game itself is pretty easy to learn, but hard to master. In fact you are always learning new ways to compete and play. ranked matches are tough but more rewarding than non ranked games. My favourite mod is snowday. Hockey is so much more fun then you can imagine. the puck uses different physics so you can't olay it the same way you would soccer.

I didn't think I would enjoy any kind of sports game but this one is fun to jump into for a few matches here and there. It's very simple but there's a lot of high skill tactics to learn in the long run. It'll keep you returning. I just wish it showed the avatars of pub match people. Silly that it just shows question marks for everyone...Edit: Also holy CRAP, this has the worst AI ever. The offline season mode should not even exist when you always get bot teammates that shoot the ball into your own goal CONSTANTLY. Every match feels like its me versus 5. But its also so stupid that I can shoot the ball from first-touch into the goal 9/10 times...."
330,554.1,Recommended," July 20, 2015",2,"Rocket League is the best multiplayer game I've ever played. It's so addicting and incredibly satisfying to pull off a good play. At first it'll feel really clumsy, but as you get the hang of it and learn to play with a bit of finesse, you realize how incredibly high the skill ceiling is. There's no nonsense here, just a simple premise with really tight controls.My *only* issue with the game is that the devs don't seem to understand how to expand on it. They just set and forget new modes which turn into ghost towns, and are constantly throwing the baby out with the bathwater when rolling back on controversial features. I'm still bummed that they completely removed mutator playlists instead of tweaking them a bit. They could've taken the time to come up with better variants and rotated them over time instead of every match so they could feel like a bit of a special event. Instead they were like ""nope, people don't like cube ball or beach ball, throw it all in the trash."" Now mutators are useless unless you can organize a match with at least 3-5 other people.Still, though, I give it an . Just hire me to make your decisions, Psyonix."

You can choose the countryzone to play matches in your area.There is also a season game mode.Alot items to unlock, to use for your car.You can not use any boosters, all cars the same, the only difference is the shape of the car, find the car shape, that fits to your play style.Play first all tutorials, before you play online.Use a Controller for this game. I recommend the Wired Xbox 360 Controller (PC & Xbox) ."
1,29.7,Recommended," June 28, 2016",2,"I had the opportunity to play Rocket League during the closed alpha tests and beyond the struggling of long matchmaking queue time due to low quorum and no diversity at that time, I was able to have fun even when losing a match. And that's what this game is about: fun. That's actually what every game should be about, in case you forgot.It's a hard game, but it offers tutorials, practicing and challenges. You can also easily find tips throughout the internet such as YouTube. Despite the difficulty, it's actually pretty fun, since it does not condemn you for losing. But rageful teammates does, therefore you can mute them.In short, I highly recommend this game. Think about it: cars, rockets, soccer... it's your childhood dream! Don't you dare reading the negative reviews, just buy it."

56,"1,273.7",Recommended," February 5, 2016",2,Good game.
23,858.0,Recommended," January 25, 2017",2,"Rocket League is a rare example where the execution of a simple, absurd idea is so strong and so engaging that it doesn’t need a ton of extra features around it. The rush of ripping across the pitch at full turbo to deny a shot on goal with a clutch bicycle-kick is enough to bring me back time and time again for just “one more match,” even without meaningful progression systems. Rocket League is a great, goofy, easy to learn and difficult to master action-sports game which demands that you grab a few friends and play a few rounds."
21,565.8,Recommended," March 19, 2017",2,"I just want to say, as an almost-addict, do NOT buy this game if you easily get addicted to games. You will easily spend 8 hours in a single night trying to learn new mechanics, or practicing that one annoying shot you can't get down. Now, if you are going to buy this game, I'd just like to say that the best things to do with this game are watch youtube videos (and the pros), and practice consistently (but not 8 hours in a night hopefully). But anyways, here comes the real review of the game.Pros:Low priceEasy to run for most computersFun, short gamesThe ability to play offline is nice for beginners or at times without wifiWorks on MacOS and Linux/SteamOSDoesn't get boring after you get into itHas controller supportMajor eSports teams are fun to followSo many car options will make your poor friends drool all over their keyboardThe skill ceiling leaves room to improve for even the prosThere are multiple game modes that keep the game entertainingThis is a really fun and innovative way to step away from first-person shooters and all those other popular games. If you think about it, how many games out there are car based that aren't racing?Cons:Not cross compatible (I know PC can play with PS4, but they can't party up or even chat together)Servers (PSYONIX PLEASE!!!)Toxic communitySome bodies (cars) cannot be achieved just by playing gamesRanking system isn't all that good, with the skill gap sometimes matching lower ranked players with high ranked players. Rocket league uses something called MMR, or matchmaking rating, to match players. In an attempt to prevent smurfing, players who have been dropping (due to being out of it, or whatever) and have, say, 400 MMR, can sometimes get matched with those who have 600, an unfair skill gap. This happened to me consistently in 1s, and this is the major downfall of Rocket League. I know Psyonix is trying to fix it, but I just have to stress that this... well, is a painIn-game items can't be sold on steam, and it's impossible to trade with PS4 players or people who aren't on your friend listOverall opinion: I really like this game. Although it can be frustrating at times, having friends who play with you makes this game worth the price, and then some. I personally would've bought this game at $30 if I had to. For someone who doesn't like to spend money, I definitely think this is worth most people's time."
70,153.8,Recommended," June 20, 2016",2,"This is a game with which I have arguably had the most fun! The controls are easy to get used to, and the action can really build up (I personally enjoy the initial clash after each score the most, as there's no knowing how it will play out)! Not to mention the beautiful soundtrack.This is also one of the few games that I have ever bought so much DLC Content for (Skyrim and South Park: The Stick of Truth are pretty much the only others), because I typically don't like spending the extra money. However, I've yet to come across another game that allows me to geek out like Rocket League does. Come on, where else can you dirve the Official Back to the Future Time-Machine Delorean, or the Bat-Mobile from Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice?Since I bought this game, Psyonix has added Hockey and Hoops as online servers; and as of today (June 20) they're adding Neo Tokyo (and here I am with an addictive sweet-tooth for all things Japanese), along with another arena for Rocket Labs (which I thoroughly enjoy)! I've also purchased another copy of this game to give to a friend since getting this game.I truly hope that Psyonix keeps releasing new content for this game, as it is the Only sports-style game I have ever enjoyed, and will ever play!Oh! Shoutout to #H20Delirious for getting me hooked on Rocket League!"

191,499.6,Recommended," October 20, 2017",2,"Ah sweet, Rocket League.This game is the whole reason for me moving to PC. After over 2k hours on Xbox and the quality of the Xbox port decreasing I decided to take the plunge and fork out for a PC, leaving 10+ years of tenure on Xbox Live in my wake but it was all worth it.Rocket League is quite simply football, but with rocket-powered cars.From Bronze I all the way up the ranks to Grand Champion Rocket League is a blast. It's high octane gameplay and 5 minute games make it a very addictive game to get into and eventually envelope yourself in. On the surface Rocket League is a very simple game with very simple mechanic, however these basic mechanics allow for an incredible amount of depth.Grab a beer, grab some friends, jump into some games and be prepared for a bunch of laughs and a hell of a good time. I can't recommend this game enough, a must-buy for any gamer of any skill-level."
122,925.5,Recommended," December 2, 2016",2,"Wow. What an incredible masterpiece from Psyonix. I can't say enough positive things about this game.First of all, their development team is impressively active and will reply to the community in a very quick time about questions/bugs and whatnot.Secondly, the game is fun for all skill levels. I had a blast when I first started out even though I was utter garbage. Now that I have over 500 hours in my belt, I have improved dramatically but still have so far to go.Finally, I have made several friends from this game that I would not have made any other way. For the most part, the community is friendly.Thanks Psyonix :')"
248,12.6,Recommended," July 18, 2015",2,"This game is very unique. I've never seen such a weird combination but it makes such an awesome and entertaining experience! The matches can feel really competitive with 1v1's, 2v2's, 3v3's, and even 4v4's! With every goal comes satisfaction. I can't believe how polished it is and how well it runs. The price is great and worth every pennie. The game seems to get a little repetitive after about 10 matches, but only when you are playing by yourself online. With friends everything changes and just having friends to play with makes the experience so much better. The game even supports 2 player splitscreen which we barely ever see on PC. I plan to put many hours into this game!"

I've played competative games throughout my whole life and Rocket League tops them all in almost every aspect. It's consistently updated and patched. The developers not only communicate but they also play with you! (gg, T-Bull ;). The controls are tight, responsive yet complex with plenty of room for a proper learning curve. The gameplay is simple with incredible room for growth.Best yet, it's fun to watch! Rocket League is already in the MLG with teams signing up left and right. Cross-play between PC and PS4 (and soon Xbone) so online play is never stale. They doubled the amount of servers worldwide due to demand.My personal favorite aspect (other than hitting an amazing shot) is that the matches are short. 5-7 minutes long with far more action than you'll see in most other esports. It's quick, it's fun, it's ROCKET LEAGUE!Wow!"

1,15.6,Recommended, January 28,2,"I've got to say this is one of the best games I have ever played. Even though I have my cons with the game I have to recommend it to anyone who likes soccer (football) and awesome cars! For $20 you can get countless hours of addicting game play. It is an easy game to pick up and hard one one to master! It is very true I love this game, but I have to say I hate the community/matchmaking. It was a lot of fun until I wanted to take the game more serious by sinking countless hours into practice and competitive play, but eventually the fun has somewhat died for me. Almost every game I join now are full of either toxic, bad, or stupid players who don't focus on the overall game but more on hitting the ball. I thought this would change the higher level I was since the computer would put me with more experienced players, but they always seem to be on the other team. There is rarely any teamwork in the higher level matches playing solo too. The same goes for competitive, I have to work so hard to keep my rank from slipping because of all the throwers. This is my experience with recent gameplay anyway, after reaching level 55 and grinding 437 hours into the game it's not fun for me anymore. I can't not recommend the game since it is a lot of fun with friends or a team, but solo gameplay will just get one frusterated or bored of losing. With that aside, this game is definitly worth the $20 just to experience the high octane, intense massive online multiplayer super rocket powered soccer (football) cars."

(even cars)Legendary musicCons: The FPS depends on some maps, making the game harder to play. But also FPS depends on your computer (this game was made with Unreal Engine)Hard difficulty (but that's just how the game is supposed to be, so it is acceptable)Most of the cars are DLC (and cost money)Game is slightly overpriced, should be about £7-8 instead (I live in the UK, I don't know USD)Overall, 9/10I would rate 10/10 if game costs a little less money, has more cars for free and maybe a lot more gamemodes. But let me say something, Pysonix may be working on some more gamemodes at this point, so you never know, soon enough the game may actually be worth £15!I recommend this game to any football fan (I LIVE IN THE ♥♥♥♥ING UK DON'T BE MAD AT ME!)and car game fans.

But even without all the trappings, the customization, the loot boxes, and the expansions, Rocket League is a sublime experience.The core gameplay is so intuitive and enjoyable that anyone, regardless of their skill level or desired skill level, can pick it up and play, enjoying it immediatley."

Jumps, rolls, boosts, riding on walls and ceilings.....all these come together to form a mash of controlled chaos. All of a sudden you're not just smashing the ball, your'e making plays, setting up shots, clearing the ball. The game is non stop action, and it's fun. Unbelievably fun. So fun you literally won't believe it. 11/10 would hit opposing players into ball and score again."
22,144.3,Recommended," October 19, 2017",2,"One of the better games that have come out within the last couple of years. Rocket League came out and was truly unique, fun and very easy to learn, whether you enjoy the casual games with friends or the competitive ranking system Rocket League does provide for all. The key is Psyonix, Inc. was able to do something different and make an impact on the industry. They didn't have to clone or copy any other game, they created their own gem in the gaming market."

Of course, it is plenty of extremely skilled players, and playing against those players is sometimes very frustrating. Nevertheless, the usual learning curve is pretty satisfactory.There are lots of options for customizing cars, and several game options as well. This game keeps people very concentrated, but it asks for experience more than for strategy and hard-thinking."
2,146.0,Recommended," January 25, 2016",2,I normally hate racing games - I was so glad this game was totally different and added it to my wishlist months before I got it.Someone else gifted the game to me and I'm so glad he did! The past three hours that I spent on the game probably belong to the best ones (regarding gaming) I had for several years.The feeling of playing it is somewhere between playing Super Smash Brothers and Carmageddon: pure chaos and pure fun.I'm sure I can't stand a chance against any professional longtimers right now but during the past matches everyone seemed to be as good (or bad :D ) as me.I totally recommend that game to anyone who just wants to have fun!

Wether I want to play a serious game and climb the ranked ladder, or just mess around with my friends, this game is repeatedly where I go. Of course, like most games, it can be pretty tilting at times; but that doesn't stop me. So here I am now, 1,100 hours into it, still feeling that I have so much more to learn about this game. I firmly believe that this game has no skill ceiling, and that it is nowhere near as popular as it could get. I highly recommend this game to anyone that thinks this game looks even just a little bit interesting."

177,58.3,Recommended," July 14, 2015",2,"*2016 Edit*I've been playing this game for over a year now, on and off it seems [noting my time spent in the game] I have been playing it either every day, or every other day.. I usually do play this game at LEAST 2 times a week.. This game is super fun, and addictive to get into..Pros- Very unique style of gameplay, very simular to it's predecessor and lives up to it as a somewhat sequle..- Controller scheme is ok, very easy to change it to what you like [have not played the PlayStation 4 version or Xbox One version of the game, but have played controller on PC]- Easy controls- Nice music- Good graphics, not too optimised, not too intensive, which is good cause I have a bad laptop..- Online is awesome, I've been unable to join an Online session because I've always had bad ping.. Now I'm able to join a session with very good ping!!!- Bots are fun to play with ESPECIALLY for training!! I love messing around with them, and practicing my skills..- Rocket Labs are amazing, I play on them the most..Cons- Bad players are often, and sometimes troll you.. Which means, being a goalie is half the time a survival game, which I don't really like.. It's nearly impossible to be a goalie when 2 people are trying to take you out..- Online still could use some fixing, I haven't really ran into troubles, but some dedicated servers could be nice instead of relying on a player host..Other than that, there's really nothing bad about this game that I don't like!! It's really fun to play!!! This ought to become something you watch on TV, or an actual league like Call of Duty players do..20/10 game, would recommend to people who hate soccer.. [I USED TO HATE SOCCER UNTIL I FOUND THIS GAME]"
217,322.4,Recommended," July 2, 2016",2,"Rocket League is a great example on how to take a simple idea and make it an incredible game. The game is easy to get into but hard to master. At first glance it may seem that this game is just about who gets to hit the ball, but there is more to it. Ball control and tactics takes some time to learn. It has the perfect balance of fun and competitive gameplay."

248,12.6,Recommended," July 18, 2015",2,"This game is very unique. I've never seen such a weird combination but it makes such an awesome and entertaining experience! The matches can feel really competitive with 1v1's, 2v2's, 3v3's, and even 4v4's! With every goal comes satisfaction. I can't believe how polished it is and how well it runs. The price is great and worth every pennie. The game seems to get a little repetitive after about 10 matches, but only when you are playing by yourself online. With friends everything changes and just having friends to play with makes the experience so much better. The game even supports 2 player splitscreen which we barely ever see on PC. I plan to put many hours into this game!"
440,968.7,Recommended," November 23, 2016",2,"I don't think I ever put more hours into a game than Rocket League. And this was a game I picked up thinking I'd play for 10-20 hours and drop it.I don't care for soccer. I'm not a car freak or care for racing games. Together, they make a combination that easy to understand, unique and most importantly, fun to play. There is only one goal in matches. Put the ball in your opponents goal. There is a stupid amount of ways to do it. Easy to play, hard to master.I found the matchmaking to be a delight. Once it is calibrated and get a base value for you, it does pretty well matching you with people around your skill. This isn't perfect and gets skewed at times, due to smurf players or being in a wide range of skill team, but my complaints are minimal.You can pick up and play for as little or as much as you want, there isn't much more than a 10 minute commitment. I've played one game for 10 minutes or too many to count for all day.It was well worth the money, and continued support from Psyonix just multiplies my appreciation for the game."

46,"1,496.0",Recommended," June 19, 2017",2,"Product received for freeMy first suggestion before writing this:^Maybe spawn in some white zombas for me just so you know I can feel better about my poverty.My BackgroundI received this game as a gift from a friend. He is a very nice person and I really should thank him for getting me this. I'm not pro, no nothing, I used to be a nolife Minecraft player, like the kind you would find online 8 hours a day on one multiplayer server, but because of this game, somehow I abandoned it. I love cars, I love to draw them, make concepts, I have a blog of my drawings, you get the point. So this game was something I had wanted for ages. When I got it I could not play very well on my little ASUS laptop, and so I had to play on my Dad's computer. Eventually, my dad had enough of me hogging his computer and bought me a HP Envy desktop for my birthday, and I could play perfectly. During that time of lag, I just played exhibition with different level bots. Which is one of my favorite features of the game, and brings me to my pros and cons, then my tips for everyone.Pros and ConsPrep for a long list,+It has controller support, a must for people who previously, or currently plays XBOX.+It has an offline mode called ""Exhibition"" where you can play with bots, and mess around with any gamemode.+It has gamemodes for any type of player, whether you're competitive, casual, wanting to troll, or anything.+There is a training mode, that the Psyonix team and other players make for each other to test for all skill levels.+If you're really bored, tired of training, ranked, etc. You can achievement hunt.+There is a cross platform system, so you could be paired with a XBOX player when you're on PC.+The chat can sometimes be funny, toxic, but funny, and it's a great addition to the game.+Your car is invincible+You can trade most items obtained via from crates, drops, or buying them with other players.+They have esports for this game called RLCS+Great graphics and performance (mostly).+This game is fun to play with friends in voice chat, or by yourself.+There is Steam leaderboards, trading cards, and again, achievements.+All the dlcs are worth buying and unlock chances for more achievements.+The dlc cars not included in bundles are quite cheap.+Added easter eggs make for great hunts.+There is a great fanbase for this game including multiple popular youtubers.+A Steam Workshop where you can make custom maps and gamemodes.+The ability to save a replay for your ""montage"" goals.+There's so much more.-Some cars have larger, wider, or longer hitboxes, which can make cars>than others.-Although the chat is a great feature, it is the main source of the toxicity and don't expect to go pro without tons of toxicity.-Scamming is a significant thing in trading so please use a middleman or triple-check offers (I would suggest looking at some guides for trading info and tips).-If there is one item/wheel/topper/etc you want, most likely you're going to have to overpay to get it.-If you don't have a good computer, you will suffer.-Some DLC cars don't look or offer as much as it is pictured.-Once you get placed in a rank, it gets increasing hard to get out of it.-You can be paired with incredibly better players than yourself in unranked and sometimes ranked.-If you like opening crates, expect to spend a bit of money trying to open them.-You have to get 12 wins in bronze or higher, then get 12 wins in silver or higher to get the silver and bronze season reward and etc. I don't like this because once you earn a rank it should make you feel like you earned it and don't have to play anymore if you're satisfied with it.-Besides third party sites and messaging friends, there is no way to let someone know a trade offer.-At some point in the game there is a guarentee you will spend money, even for just one crate.-Sometimes Psyonix adding an update to the game just to make an excuse for a new crate is pointless, because what do you know it's a holiday in a couple of weeks and they're going to release a crate for that.-Leaving the game is way too easy in unranked.*When someone offers you money (such as PayPal balance) always have a middle man.*Watch out for scammers and always double check for offers.*Starting a Youtube channel about Rocket League usually comes with hate.*It takes lots of dedication to become good and high leveled.*Your rank in ranked doesn't always reflect your skill level.(I'm addressing Psyonix)^Along with saving the replay for the game, save the chat replay also, making it easier to provide evidence for a report and to catch ironic moments.^(I'm sure you've never heard this) upgrade your servers instead of buying Zig Zag Toys.^Add cross-console parties (NOT for trading) but so we can play with each other without praying we meet in a match.^Fix the broken mouse I threw across the room due to Psyonix's servers.^Oh and also maybe spawn in some white zombas for me just so you know I can feel better about my poverty.Hope you enjoyed this review, I love the game and recommend it for any car, soccer, competitive, and most players.My favorite game, 19/20.Edit: Update For Badge"

61,571.6,Recommended," December 29, 2017",2,"Rocket League is a great game for people willing to spend hours grinding highly mechanical and technical skills (if you wish to progress through the ranks). As someone with 500+ hours, I mostly fool around and have not ranked up very far in competitive matchmaking. Due to many unfair*** matchmaking encounters and a toxic community, I tend to avoid playing Rocket League. It is great for people who are highly competitive, but I would not reccomend playing if you like casual, fun-for-everyone type-games.Microtransactions are purely cosemetic and asthetic, and trading is common amongst players. I would not reccomend purchasing keys as they are wallet-draining.Graphically, the game is fantastic, and updates constantly feed the community with new items, arenas, and cars. To run highest quality graphics at 60+ FPS, you need a beefy computer.Though I have had a negative experience from Rocket League, I do still reccomend it as a game to try, as it is one of the highest grossing games across the Steam community. Take my experience as warnings of what could happen, but not of what will happen.Rocket League - 5/10***Unbalanced skill peaks, Smurfing, Ping/Lag, Graphics, Controller vs. Keyboard"

65,"1,457.4",Recommended," June 24, 2016",2,"It seems like such a little kid game: whacky looking racecars hitting a soccer ball. But my one friend had about 80 hours of play time and insisted that it was a great game. So did everyone else within the massive amount of positive reviews. Also, I hadn't played a car driving game in a while. With that said, I added it to my wishlist and the moment it went on sale I bought it.Here I am now with over 100 hours of play time that FLEW by.Beautiful clean graphics and game menus. Crystal clear audio with fun electronic songs when in menu. Playing with friends has always worked perfectly for me, whether online or split screen. Believe it or not I prefer playing with the keyboard, but the Xbox 360 controller works great, as does the PS4 controller. I love playing with friends but it's very fun going solo as well, and I don't say that often. Many ""hats"" and ""antennas"" to style your car with. Many paint types and colors to style your car with. A decent amount of cars to pick from. A decent amount of arenas and game modes to choose from, or create your own rules in your own arena and invite friends. If you don't have any friends the game's bots work well, although they are pretty easy even when set to their hardest difficulty. I'd equate the bots on ""All-Star"" to a real player who is around ""Semi-Pro"". There is an exp point system and leveling up, but it doesn't do anything other than change the status displayed underneath your name such as ""Rookie, Semi-Pro, Pro, Veteran, Expert, Master, Legend"" of which you can opt out of displaying. There are multiple camera options (can be very helpful) and graphics options. There are multiple servers in many regions, and you can toggle which regions to connect to. Also, the developers keep the game updated and release both free and purchasable content from time to time.The game itself is soccer but with cars. Cars that can jump! And if you are good enough, cars that can even fly haha. There are boost pads that speed you up and you can use the boost to ""aerial"" as well.Cool side-note: This is the first game for PC that is cross-platform with both Xbox One and Playstation 4 players. If you are playing a match and notice someone's picture says ""PSY NET"" that means that they are using a console.Not much else to say other than try this game out for yourself!"

172,23.7,Recommended," August 3, 2015",2,"The simplicity of Rocket League is what makes this game so addictive!So easy to get into, loads of customization and items for the cars. You even get hats! Which you unlock the more matches you play, so no microtransactions! I cant stress enough of how much fun this game is, if you havent bought it already I highly recommend it. Even if you're not into football.Also did I mention you get hats?"
51,167.5,Recommended," June 17, 2017",2,"Rocket League is one of a kind. This is a game about cars playing football (or soccer depending on where you live) and it is simply just amazing. The gameplay is great, it's easy to play but hard to master. If you have friends to play with you'll have an even better time with it than going solo, but going at it alone can be quite enjoyable too. There are no server issues and all DLC is purely cosmetic with there being no direct advantages to using a certain car over another (although each car has different hitboxes).When you buy this game, it will take about 20-30 hours to actually start hitting balls. By 100-150 hours, you'll be flying around the map to score some crazy looking goals (in your opinion). But then, that's when the fun actually begins: mastering the basic moves of the game is basically mastering 1% of what you can do in this game. You'll end up playing more and more and more, until you realize you've just spent three hours in practice hitting the same shot again and again. Yes, this game is higly addictive. This is my sumrf account."

I don't think I need to point out that I like the game, but perhaps I can explain why it's fun to an outsider thinking about trying it, with a few simple bullet-points:- Not time-demanding: games are 5 minutes long, with goal replays and kickoffs that usually takes it to 7. Overtime happens if your tied, and then you can take it to 10.- No punishment, no grind: if you dont like a game you're playing, leave. It might hurt your team, so think if you want to help them out or hinder them before doing so, but there is no impact to leaving.- Fast matchmaking: as an Aussie I'm accustomed to match-finding sometimes taking 10 minutes or more. Was very pleasantly surprised to see how many people still played this game even 2 years after launch. A game can usually be found within 1 minute, often within seconds.- Casual and competitive: somehow this game is both- Fun: you drive and fly a rocket car in a soccer match. With explosions.

Personally I've used a PS3 controller from the start.Extra props for Psyonix for cross-platform matchmaking with PS4, great performance even on low end machines, free DLC maps, and 4-player splitscreen support on PC.It's also the second best hat simulator on Steam."

You sometimes randomly get paired with ps4 players, and you can host a private match between pc and ps4 but matchmaking is where the real fun is to be had and without cross-platform form matchmaking, the whole cross platform thing seems kind of pointless other than to increase the player base."

3,"1,808.9",Recommended," September 7, 2017",2,"Rocket League, the successor to Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle Cars (SARPBC for short) is a great game to play. It involves using your car to hit a ball into a net, similar layout to soccer. Psyonix have done a great job on improving from SARPBC, especially with the wide range of customizable cars, the vast amount of items and even the mutiple game modes currently available, such as Hoops (Basketball) or Dropshot.Everything about this game screams a good time. From the different game modes, to opening crates you get after matches, you have a lot of different ways of having fun with this game.I rate this game: 9/10 - Wonderful game"

53,"1,804.0",Recommended," December 22, 2017",2,"Rocket League is the best game you will ever spend your hard earned $20 on. The replay factor is top notch on this game and the game gives gifts that keep on giving. So much ongoing free content from the game developers that the staff at Psyonix truly set a standard when it comes to games. Even the pay to play crate system is above average in this game! You buy keys to open crates that you earn while playing the game, but you don't have to if you don't want to. Plenty of other players will trade you for those crates if you're not a money spender on keys. Then there's the Rocket League Championships where the free money is always flowing, but you gotta git gud kids!"

161,18.7,Recommended," September 3, 2015",2,A really fun simple game yet can be very competitive depending on who verses who. Customizing your car is very amusing. Very easy to run on most PC's.For 20 bucks you can't really go wrong with that but if you find this on sale definitely check it out. :)
33,782.5,Recommended," December 28, 2015",2,"Psyonix is the BEST developer ever. The game is only $20 to begin with. The DLC are like $3 each and are COMPLETELY optional. The cars added through DLC are just cosmetic and give the players no advantage over others who dont have the DLC (AKA super balanced gameplay). Overall the gameplay is easy to learn YET VERY HARD TO MASTER. This game is super addictive and I can't see myself putting it down in the foreseeable future. My friends and I are moving up through the ranked leagues and although it may seem like a grind, every match is enjoyable. The car customization, cross platform play, splitscreen multiplayer, mutators, and frequent updates are some added benefits that make this game great.Must have game IMO."

I bought RL on sale and got hooked immediately. My only beef is that the AIs can be a bit sucky, and like to score on their own goals.. a lot. They're very playable though, and if I want something more realistic I can just hop onto matchmaking. Even with only a few hours worth of playtime it's enough to hop online and not be stuck at the bottom of the scoreboard.10/10 Soccer Simulator"

235,"3,391.7",Recommended," March 17, 2016",2,"First look at game:Looked great considering they're using the unreal engine.Thought it would be like a regular football game but with cars.The concept was cool so I decided to purchase it.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------So, I heard about this game through Youtube videos I watch. The game looked awesome as in graphics wise for what it was, I had previously taken a look at the parent game SARP Battle-Cars. So upon doing more research I decided to go ahead and purchase the game.I enjoyed every minute I played of the game from the beginning, considering I was quite new and getting owned it was still fun. Once I had started clocking about one/two hours into the game I easily learnt the basics of the game, however I still was missing that power to start winning games which is Aerials. I decided to start practicing, around the time of me starting to practiced I clocked about ten/fifthteen hours played. I was enjoying it, I had found my new love in a game.I've never really been a fan of Soccer/Football games so this was a gamble for me, however I loved it. I am up to 194 hours played on Steam, this does not include the 300+ hours I have on console. I had decided to purchase this game on console as well considering you can cross-platform in this game, I would say this game is worth a lot more money than it is.They're constantly adding new updates to the game which implement; new maps, new DLC cars and new modes! Just recently they added the Hockey game mode, this adds new physics to the ball which was now known as a Hockey Puck.The new cars are amazing, constantly adding DLC cars is a good concept. I have purchased all the DLC on console as I have said above I believe this game is worth a lot more.I would recommend this game to anyone that does not have it as of yet. It is very easy to get the hang of and it's a good laugh with friends.I can't count how many times me and my fellow steam/console friends have burst in tears of laughter from playing this game. It is a really enjoyable experience!"

217,322.4,Recommended," July 2, 2016",2,"Rocket League is a great example on how to take a simple idea and make it an incredible game. The game is easy to get into but hard to master. At first glance it may seem that this game is just about who gets to hit the ball, but there is more to it. Ball control and tactics takes some time to learn. It has the perfect balance of fun and competitive gameplay."

1,"1,612.3",Recommended," March 27, 2016",2,"Easy to learn; difficult to master; even harder to stop playing. I have 400+ hours on PS4, and didn't hesitate to buy it on PC as well.You can pick this game up and instantly be able to participate in a meaningful way in online matches, but the game will push you to progress along with your competition. You will start out celebrating a goal, then celebrate a backflip goal, then celebrate an aerial goal, before celebrating a backwards/upside down/freestyle/aerial goal.Matches have a 5 minute timer, and so you end up saying ""just one more game before bed"" until you realize it's 2am.If you have friends I definitely recommend bringing them along the learning process with you. If not, then you can meet plenty of nice people from within the game.UPDATE: 1000 hours in the PC version now. I also have the Collector's Edition for XB1 and PS4 now. Nominating this game for a Steam Award.UPDATE 2: 1500 hours on PC, untold hours on Xbox and PS4 both. I play this on all consoles - it's that fun. Nominating for steam award."

65,"1,457.4",Recommended," June 24, 2016",2,"It seems like such a little kid game: whacky looking racecars hitting a soccer ball. But my one friend had about 80 hours of play time and insisted that it was a great game. So did everyone else within the massive amount of positive reviews. Also, I hadn't played a car driving game in a while. With that said, I added it to my wishlist and the moment it went on sale I bought it.Here I am now with over 100 hours of play time that FLEW by.Beautiful clean graphics and game menus. Crystal clear audio with fun electronic songs when in menu. Playing with friends has always worked perfectly for me, whether online or split screen. Believe it or not I prefer playing with the keyboard, but the Xbox 360 controller works great, as does the PS4 controller. I love playing with friends but it's very fun going solo as well, and I don't say that often. Many ""hats"" and ""antennas"" to style your car with. Many paint types and colors to style your car with. A decent amount of cars to pick from. A decent amount of arenas and game modes to choose from, or create your own rules in your own arena and invite friends. If you don't have any friends the game's bots work well, although they are pretty easy even when set to their hardest difficulty. I'd equate the bots on ""All-Star"" to a real player who is around ""Semi-Pro"". There is an exp point system and leveling up, but it doesn't do anything other than change the status displayed underneath your name such as ""Rookie, Semi-Pro, Pro, Veteran, Expert, Master, Legend"" of which you can opt out of displaying. There are multiple camera options (can be very helpful) and graphics options. There are multiple servers in many regions, and you can toggle which regions to connect to. Also, the developers keep the game updated and release both free and purchasable content from time to time.The game itself is soccer but with cars. Cars that can jump! And if you are good enough, cars that can even fly haha. There are boost pads that speed you up and you can use the boost to ""aerial"" as well.Cool side-note: This is the first game for PC that is cross-platform with both Xbox One and Playstation 4 players. If you are playing a match and notice someone's picture says ""PSY NET"" that means that they are using a console.Not much else to say other than try this game out for yourself!"

258,415.6,Recommended, January 15,2,"It's a great game, really well-polished. You will usually find yourself shouting at the screen or ragequitting after your opponent is extremely lucky and takes a random shot and scores after all your teammates fail to save. The music is also very nice, I sometimes hang out in the menu just to listen to those Monstercat songs.One disadvantage is that in the last months, the updates don't really add new features, but they add a crate. But if you can ignore that, you are set for no regret. Another bigger disadvantage is the bugs that appear with the new updates, that usually get fixed in 2-3 weeks, kinda slow. But some of them didn't get fixed until now. For example, there's this but with the profile pictues. If you hit tab, those will usally be glitched, and bots will have profile pictures, Steam players will have PSY Net pictures and so on. It's not a huge thing, but it's definitely something to consider.Overall, my experience with Rocket League is great. If you play around 50-60 hours you get the hang of the game and you become pretty good. You may miss some shots, that's true, but even Legends do that. This is that type of game that you can't get bored with. I usally play a game like 2-3 weeks and then unistall it, but this game has something new every match. Also, rumble is waaaay to RNG based, and it's really fun to play with your friends and laugh your head off."

154,"2,179.9",Recommended," January 30, 2016",2,"Rocket League has one of the best progression systems I've ever seen in a video game before...Rookie - You can't hit♥♥♥♥♥♥ You are a disgrace to your team and the game.Semi Pro - You can now sometimes hit the ball. Don't even try to hit it in the right direction or think about your positioning. You're only Semi Pro so you can just go ahead and hit that ball! You also made a bicycle hit that one time but yeah nah you're still♥♥♥♥♥♥Pro - You have learnt how to shoot the ball accurately from the ground. You're the best! Late into Pro level, you would have likely looked up advanced tips for Rocket League. Worst mistake of your life. You now know what aerials are. You think you can fly. The ball comes up high and you go for an aerial. Once you jump, you fly straight into the ground and continue to do frontflips until you land on your back... What the ♥♥♥♥ happened there? Oh. You're using keyboard. Yeah nah, time to get a controller,♥♥♥♥♥♥head.Veteran - You now have a controller and go for terribly unlikely aerials. You think you're good. You can hit the lower aerials consistently and you can now be considered an addition to your team. Congratulations!Expert - You can now consistently hit aerials accurately at any height. This game is now your life. You can also score off a wall every now and then. Good times.Master - You are now a god to every level lower than you. You have perfected the art of wall shots. You are an extremely cool person. A nice little bonus is that everyone under the level of Pro will now spam ""Sorry!"" every time they do something wrong to you.Legend - The most badass-looking title you can have. ♥♥♥♥ Rocketeer. You probably now have an extreme case of false confidence. Once you get used to the badass title, you'll wreck anything and anyone with ease. You can also pull off freestyles consistently. Nice job! Also be sure to prepare for an endless stream of ""You're not good enough for Legend!""Rocketeer - You can now 720-freestyle-backflip-reverse-backwards-aerial-air dribble off a wall with ease. You probably boosted for that Rocketeer tag, but if you didn't: Still prepare for another endless stream of ""You're not good enough for Rocketeer!""But in all seriousness, I absolutely love this game and I'm sure anyone will. I've literally never seen someone dislike this game after they've played 10 hours. (Rocket League moves onto a whole-nother level of fun and addiction once you learn how to fly.)If you're still contemplating buying this game after reading this review, just trust me when I say it is one of the most fun and addictive games I've ever played (more gripping than Skyrim and GTA).Think about it this way: You wouldn't have made it this far through the review if you didn't secretly want this game.

235,"3,391.7",Recommended," March 17, 2016",2,"First look at game:Looked great considering they're using the unreal engine.Thought it would be like a regular football game but with cars.The concept was cool so I decided to purchase it.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------So, I heard about this game through Youtube videos I watch. The game looked awesome as in graphics wise for what it was, I had previously taken a look at the parent game SARP Battle-Cars. So upon doing more research I decided to go ahead and purchase the game.I enjoyed every minute I played of the game from the beginning, considering I was quite new and getting owned it was still fun. Once I had started clocking about one/two hours into the game I easily learnt the basics of the game, however I still was missing that power to start winning games which is Aerials. I decided to start practicing, around the time of me starting to practiced I clocked about ten/fifthteen hours played. I was enjoying it, I had found my new love in a game.I've never really been a fan of Soccer/Football games so this was a gamble for me, however I loved it. I am up to 194 hours played on Steam, this does not include the 300+ hours I have on console. I had decided to purchase this game on console as well considering you can cross-platform in this game, I would say this game is worth a lot more money than it is.They're constantly adding new updates to the game which implement; new maps, new DLC cars and new modes! Just recently they added the Hockey game mode, this adds new physics to the ball which was now known as a Hockey Puck.The new cars are amazing, constantly adding DLC cars is a good concept. I have purchased all the DLC on console as I have said above I believe this game is worth a lot more.I would recommend this game to anyone that does not have it as of yet. It is very easy to get the hang of and it's a good laugh with friends.I can't count how many times me and my fellow steam/console friends have burst in tears of laughter from playing this game. It is a really enjoyable experience!"

340,842.5,Recommended," November 24, 2017",2,"Nerver thought i'd like this game as i loved. I knew about RL since the release and that time i just followed some streamers and youtube players making RL videos. At that time i just thought ''Meah, maybe just funny with people you know, friends, etc, and for a short period.''. But i was really wrong.Rocket League is the game i most played in my account and also last year. I invested a lot on it and i don't regret 'cuz the experience was worth it. At the begining, it seems cheesy and childish the merge of cars with soccer, but with this thought you are just thinking about the common way of driving cars and play soccer. What i mean is that RL is about hability and a lot of practice if you want to have a different experience of what you think that can be boring.The game mechanic allows you to make acrobats, freestyle rolls and jumps, beautiful movements and most important: Goals, defenses and plays that make you go crazy and a lot of times you scream ''NO WAY!'' ''WTF!!'' ''R U KIDDING ME!?''. hahahaRocket league is a game that if you search its history about the development process, you'll see it's a game that deserves all it has now, a great public on streams, loyal players and obviously the deserved profit. Through the last year until now, they had constantly updated the game with nice features, dlcs, partnerships, skins, game modes and more. And this shows that the team is really into the game.-CONS-But nothing is perfect and the most problems of RL, are the same problems of most of online multiplayer games. Community is one of the most toxic i ever seem. It's something between LOL and Overwatch. Maybe because the majority of players may be children or at least with childish behavior, i don't know. But there's also that disagreements between Latin players, resulting with racist messages, rage with no reason and lack of respect.The second problem is the price to get nice skins. RL has lootboxes that are really nice, but the price to pay to open them is SUPER expensive compared to other games and most of times not worth it. However, they have nice dlcs that is satisfactory.After 800 hours and nice friends i made, i'm leaving the game with this review."

I figured I'd try it for an hour or so and refund it. 80 hours later, I'm still playing it and it's become one of my favorite games.I see a lot of reviews talk about ""toxic"" players, but have only seen a handful in 80 hours. More often, I've seen even the opposing team compliment a great shot, or sometimes make a sarcastic comment on a bad shot, and that's about the extent of it.Overall, it's a great game whether playing with friends or random people online."

It has the perfect balance of fun and competitive play. New to the game? No problem. Get in there and you'll be qued with people just as awful. Practice, practice, ragequit, and practice some more and before you know it the chat board is lighting up with ""Nice shot! and ""Savage!"". This game rewards practice. You'll know what I mean when you master a shot you've been working on. The game does nothing for you. There's a ball, there's your car, and the rest is up to you. Quick chat with your teammates and work together and you will face less toxicity. Buy the game, and don't give up when you get your axles snapped by a more skilled player. That'll be you in just a few weeks. Oh what's that, you've gotten REALLY good? Even better. The competitive scene is blowing up. Make some money while you're at it."

The game is continuously being updated as well. My only complaint is that there are moderate/extreme moment of lag in the game. Of course, this may be just because of my internet connection rather than their servers."
177,58.3,Recommended," July 14, 2015",2,"*2016 Edit*I've been playing this game for over a year now, on and off it seems [noting my time spent in the game] I have been playing it either every day, or every other day.. I usually do play this game at LEAST 2 times a week.. This game is super fun, and addictive to get into..Pros- Very unique style of gameplay, very simular to it's predecessor and lives up to it as a somewhat sequle..- Controller scheme is ok, very easy to change it to what you like [have not played the PlayStation 4 version or Xbox One version of the game, but have played controller on PC]- Easy controls- Nice music- Good graphics, not too optimised, not too intensive, which is good cause I have a bad laptop..- Online is awesome, I've been unable to join an Online session because I've always had bad ping.. Now I'm able to join a session with very good ping!!!- Bots are fun to play with ESPECIALLY for training!! I love messing around with them, and practicing my skills..- Rocket Labs are amazing, I play on them the most..Cons- Bad players are often, and sometimes troll you.. Which means, being a goalie is half the time a survival game, which I don't really like.. It's nearly impossible to be a goalie when 2 people are trying to take you out..- Online still could use some fixing, I haven't really ran into troubles, but some dedicated servers could be nice instead of relying on a player host..Other than that, there's really nothing bad about this game that I don't like!! It's really fun to play!!! This ought to become something you watch on TV, or an actual league like Call of Duty players do..20/10 game, would recommend to people who hate soccer..

330,107.2,Recommended," July 17, 2015",2,"TL;DR Rocket League is awesome, no microtransactions, great gameplay, awesome graphics, re-playability, and cross platform multiplayer. Needs a controller. Good for 20$ but if you are willing to wait for a sale go for it.So my review i will try and leave it short and simple.I used to play Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle Cars on PS3 when it came out and they really re-delivered a solid experience for Steam and PS4. I do highly recommend a controller for it because the keyboard controls are super clunky. The best one at the best price is a Logitech F310 which is like 15$ right now i believe on Amazon. Anyway, The game is fluent and runs fantastic on practically any PC. The cross-platform multiplayer sets up for some amazing competition especially in ranked. The hats, trails, cars, and decals are all unlockable and not microtransactioned at all which i personally thought was fantastic. There is no advantage to having a minivan or a truck compared to the hotrod and lamborghini bodies for your vehicle. The game is entirely skill based and has a great tutorial and many great training exercises.All in all for a 20$ price tag it is worth it in my eyes, but to most people i would say wait for a sale or at least watch some videos on it."

34,40.6,Recommended," December 13, 2016",2,"I absolutely love Rocket League, it has become one of the best games I've ever played. The graphics, the gameplay mechanics, the features in the game, and so much more that this game has that just makes it so widely brilliant. The game has many different game modes, and my favorite out of all of them has to be the rumble mode. It's power ups just make this mode even better than the standard mode. I haven't really played any of the other modes yet, but I may play those soon. The cars are also completely customizable, and you can do over 10 billion combinations, which is actually very suprising in my opinion.The game does take a while to get used to however, since it is quite a wild game. The camera angles, and the control can take a while to get used to, however that dosen't really make the game any worse. The online matches are absolutely incredible. You can play in either 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, or 4v4 matches, and meeting new people and getting into amazing matches is simply delightful, and every game, even if you're pro or not, still has you going for the ball. There's also many stylish moves you can perform in the game, such as bicycle hits, flips, sideflips, backflips, aerial hits, and so much more, which makes the game very strategical in a way. There's also DLC you can purchase in the game, like new cars and such. I purchased the triton car, and it just looks...well...fashionable! :P Psyonix, the developers of Rocket League, cleary know how to run this game perfectly. They are constantly pushing out new updates in a matter of time, and the content they bring in is amazing.Overall, I'd simply give this masterpiece a perfect 10/10 score.

96,157.3,Recommended," October 27, 2016",2,"Seriously just a great game. One of the better games I've played lately. I really like that games are short so that you're not stuck in a 90 minute game, and if something comes up you're only a few minutes from being done with a match.Easily my favorite game for when I want to sit back and relax and not ""try hard"" in a video game. Great for all ages also."
34,40.6,Recommended," December 13, 2016",2,"I absolutely love Rocket League, it has become one of the best games I've ever played. The graphics, the gameplay mechanics, the features in the game, and so much more that this game has that just makes it so widely brilliant. The game has many different game modes, and my favorite out of all of them has to be the rumble mode. It's power ups just make this mode even better than the standard mode. I haven't really played any of the other modes yet, but I may play those soon. The cars are also completely customizable, and you can do over 10 billion combinations, which is actually very suprising in my opinion.The game does take a while to get used to however, since it is quite a wild game. The camera angles, and the control can take a while to get used to, however that dosen't really make the game any worse. The online matches are absolutely incredible. You can play in either 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, or 4v4 matches, and meeting new people and getting into amazing matches is simply delightful, and every game, even if you're pro or not, still has you going for the ball. There's also many stylish moves you can perform in the game, such as bicycle hits, flips, sideflips, backflips, aerial hits, and so much more, which makes the game very strategical in a way. There's also DLC you can purchase in the game, like new cars and such. I purchased the triton car, and it just looks...well...fashionable! :P Psyonix, the developers of Rocket League, cleary know how to run this game perfectly. They are constantly pushing out new updates in a matter of time, and the content they bring in is amazing.Overall, I'd simply give this masterpiece a perfect 10/10 score. It's just one of the best games ever made in my opinion. I highly recommend this to you, and you will definetely have fun playing this game. ;)"
318,652.3,Recommended, February 3,2,"If the idea of playing soccer with rocket-powered cars sounds like a great time to you, this is the game for you. The gameplay of Rocket League has tons of depth, once you begin to master aerials and wallriding, the game really opens up and shows you the complexity you can put into plays when 3D space is open for your exploitation.Rocket League is, without a doubt, my favorite game of all time."

21,311.2,Recommended," July 1, 2016",2,"Played this game for about two months now, and all I can say is I love it. No match is ever the same and there's a ton of different skill levels and ways to play. One thing that annoys me the most however, is the community. Out of EVERY game i've played Rocket League has by far the worst community for lower level players. It's riddled with afk's, people who abandon matches when they're losing, and over all just REALLY toxic people. It does get better the higher level you get and if you're able to get over it for a while, it's not THAT bad. Over all I highly recomend this game for anyone that's looking for a fun new type of mmo. I rate this game a respectable 6/10 for new players. Not that it means anything, it's just my personal rating."

42,475.2,Not Recommended," June 26, 2017",2,"So I have been playing this game for a very long time, and I have to say it's pretty fun if you want to play casually. But when it comes to ranked, it's a whole different story. The way you rank up is terrible. I won a game, but didn't rank up. Okay, I'm fine with that. But tell me how the next game, I lose and I drop the divisions?! I was gold 2 division 2, then dropped to gold 1 division 4. That's insane. I just don't get it.When they add a new game mode, it's fun for about a week, then gets super boring. Now all they add are new crates and every once in a while a new game mode that is only fun for a little while."

Well lets go back to Rocketleague Prospect lvl 1 and start learning how to do these AerialsThis game is awesome.This game is cheap.No money grabbing devs.No chests which require 2-3 euro to get a random crap skin.Yes they sale DLC but except some small hitbox changes of the cars they are all the same.Its fun.

43,907.3,Recommended," November 27, 2016",2,"Well, with over 400 hours in this game and already Master, I feel like I am able to make an accurate review on this wonderful game that is Rocket League (RL). First off, it's supersonic soccer... with cars! Pretty cool concept if you ask me. Plus, with the addition of a worldwide multiplayer, with ton of playlists, and even Playstation Cross-Play, it's the perfect team game. Also, when you're bored, you can go ahead and invite a few friends and play a private match splitscreen or even just online again. Even the physics (whithout changing mutators) are pretty accurate... well except for some pinches. Pretty great game to just jump into a very docile and friendly community. Heck, just join a RLCS stream and look at the whole chat. Completely friendly, not that you can see most of it mind you, with it going so fast. In conclusion, I'd recommend almost anyone to play this game, ESPECIALLY since it's on sale right now! However, every now and then you'll get a person who chooses to be salt. Ignore 'em and report 'em if they're getting sour and salty. Other than that, overwhelmingly well made game with great community, definately a game I would recommend. I promise you, it's worth it."
340,842.5,Recommended," November 24, 2017",2,"Nerver thought i'd like this game as i loved. I knew about RL since the release and that time i just followed some streamers and youtube players making RL videos. At that time i just thought ''Meah, maybe just funny with people you know, friends, etc, and for a short period.''. But i was really wrong.Rocket League is the game i most played in my account and also last year. I invested a lot on it and i don't regret 'cuz the experience was worth it. At the begining, it seems cheesy and childish the merge of cars with soccer, but with this thought you are just thinking about the common way of driving cars and play soccer. What i mean is that RL is about hability and a lot of practice if you want to have a different experience of what you think that can be boring.The game mechanic allows you to make acrobats, freestyle rolls and jumps, beautiful movements and most important: Goals, defenses and plays that make you go crazy and a lot of times you scream ''NO WAY!'' ''WTF!!'' ''R U KIDDING ME!?''. hahahaRocket league is a game that if you search its history about the development process, you'll see it's a game that deserves all it has now, a great public on streams, loyal players and obviously the deserved profit. Through the last year until now, they had constantly updated the game with nice features, dlcs, partnerships, skins, game modes and more. And this shows that the team is really into the game.-CONS-But nothing is perfect and the most problems of RL, are the same problems of most of online multiplayer games. Community is one of the most toxic i ever seem. It's something between LOL and Overwatch. Maybe because the majority of players may be children or at least with childish behavior, i don't know. But there's also that disagreements between Latin players, resulting with racist messages, rage with no reason and lack of respect.The second problem is the price to get nice skins. RL has lootboxes that are really nice, but the price to pay to open them is SUPER expensive compared to other games and most of times not worth it. However, they have nice dlcs that is satisfactory.After 800 hours and nice friends i made, i'm leaving the game with this review."

190,72.7,Recommended," July 12, 2015",2,"Okay, I don't know where this game came from, but holy hell is it good, Rocket League was just released very recently and It is so thrilling and exciting, I can't even begin to praise this game, I don't even know where to start, it's like someone somewhere took the Soccer Mini-game from Road Trip Adventure and asked ""This could be so much better, how can we improve this? Lets throw in some trick jumps and nitro cars, oh and boosting! Lots and lots of boosting!""So, what is Rocket League? I guess we'll start there.Rocket League is a football racing hybrid game, you are one of up to 8 high flying, boosting nitro cars playing on either Team Blue or Team Orange. Your objective? Put the ball in the back of the goal more times than your opponents, 4v4 is the way to play this game and it is exhilarating to say the least when there are 8 high speed cars rushing for the ball going at who knows how many miles per hour.The control and movement is fantastic, It manages to maintain it's familiar car driving feel but the developers have added a number of features to add to football element which are very easy to pick up and learn, you can jump and flip in any direction to try and intercept any potential enemy goals, you can double tap your jump button dash forward to gain even more speed, you can boost to crash into the opposing team to potentionally take them out of the match for a brief moment, heck you can drive on the cieling if you wanted to! The game will refuse to give you any moment of pause, adding to an even more intense feeling.The graphics I love, it's very bright, cheery and filled with life with abstract patterns and great field designs, ranging from day to night, weather effects, large arenas filled with roaring crowds and wide open grassy pitches, sound design is just as exhilarating as the game itself, the crowd never lets up, the satisfying sound of the ball exploding when a goal is scored and the engines of your cars getting ready to charge to the middle of the arena will make you narrow your eyebrows and grin as you prepare to crash into your opposition.Customisation is a worthy thing to note as well, there are many car bodies, exhaust fumes, patterns, cosmetics and colours for you to pick from to make your nitro striker truly your own and bodies do not come with stats, meaning that you can use the body that YOU want to use, not because it has +5 acceleration. Your customisation will be limiting at first, but there is even more to unlcok by simply playing the game and gaining levels, so replayability? ✓.There is a reason why this game is so popular right now, I rarely write reviews after purchase but I can honestly see this game going places, It's fast, it's fun, it's exhilarating and competitive. Thanks to multi-platform integration with PS4, there'll never be a shortage of people to play! If you are at all on the fence about this, I honestly recommend you give it a try. the value is more than most Triple A titles these days and provided you like cars, football or both, you will have a blast."

The performance is great, i can handle this game with my potatoe pc with an average of 50 fps on lowest settings.Not much to complain about... however.. well.. the community.The most sarcastic pieces of trash ive ever seen. You miss a save ? Thank god the enemy team spams ""WHAT A SAVE"" to make you feel better or ""NICE SHOT"" once you miss a goalshot. The ingame voice communication also lacks quite a bit of quality. I mostly end up asking my friend what some dude just screamed into his mic once we start losing.(also the ranking system is frustrating and slow imo)Still, if you dont mind those spams (or if Psyonix could invent a ""Block quick commands"" button), its almost a must buy.

299,"1,651.0",Recommended," October 10, 2016",2,"Holy ♥♥♥♥ is this game insanely fun and addictive. If you are a competitive player in any way and enjjoy seeing noticeable improvements to your play then this is an absolute must buy. It may seem like a simple game however the amount of mechanics available to master means that you are constantly improving.You will start out just trying to learn how to hit the ball consistently. Then once you master that you start trying to learn how to aim your shots. Then you start learning how to powerslide and fly. Once you get flying down pretty good you learn how to air roll to fine tune your aerials. Then you learn how to power shot, defend the net, rotate effectively as a team, block 50/50 hits. The list goes on and on. A lot of the mechanics build off of each other so once you learn one you can begin learning the next. As you master each one it becomes muscle memory allowing you to work on the next. It is an amazing feeling once you start connecting mechanics that you learn together.Then you have the casual side of Rocket League. Thanks to game modes like Rumble even complete noobs have a blast and are able to contribute. This game truly is one of the best games you could possibly buy and it is so incredibly cheap."
104,579.7,Recommended," July 3, 2017",2,"IF you've never played Rocket League, like many other good games you're probably going to be dog♥♥♥♥♥♥when you first start. You'll first join the tutorial and start touching the ball, yea it feels good we know. Then you decide you'll give online a go, REAllY see what this ♥♥♥♥♥ is about. You're first game online you get 2 clears and a center ball, pretty raunchy. You decide to tax yourself on another game and press rematch. You give a great pass to your team mate, wou lose 1-2. You continue to play online even though you have no idea what the ♥♥♥♥ you're doing but for some reason you can't stop playing it. Then you start to progress and get better and learn to manipulate the car and the ball in ways you've never seen, and fly(Did I mention you could ♥♥♥♥ing fly). You then start to forget about where you came from and whether or not you even liked the damn game to begin with. You slowly then being training every day before work or school, practicing aerials and dribbling in free play mode. The ball slowly becomes a part of you. You become the rank of ""Pro"" and you're feeling pretty damn hot right now♥♥♥♥♥♥ even scalding. You slowly climb the ranks and descend into the madness that is rocket league. Then the itch starts. You'll be at work or out running errands thinking about how much better time could be spent playing rocket league. When you see a subaru on the road, it's not a subaru to you anymore it's now a Takumi. When you go to bed you dream of Rocket League. Now we go back to the original question of whether or not you would like this game? You'll ♥♥♥♥ing love it, too much. The developers, Psyonix, are incredibly good at listening to what the community wants. Each update they continue to push out more and more content and the game is growing everyday. So many funny options to decorate and customize your cars, from toppers to antennas. You can unlock items in game and craft rarer, more exclusive items from those. You dont have to good at rocket league to like it, you just have to be better at having fun. I have made so many memories off this $20 purchase. Like how the hell are they only charging $20 for this game its incredible. I Have put more time and heart into this game on PC and Xbox then any of the main AAA titles that I used to play, and I probably won't stop. Buy this game. Play this game. Love this game."

1,"1,069.9",Recommended," November 25, 2017",2,"SummaryRocket League is instantly familiar and easy to grasp while being incredibly hard to master. The term Rocket-Powered Soccer Cars sums up the core element of the game. The main draw to the game is the online multi-player eSports style of play. Quick 5 minute matches, whether casual or competitive, can be incredibly intense with Epic Saves, Aerial Dribbles, and Sniper Precise Long-Shots. All-in-all Rocket League is a quick pickup-n-play game that is hard to put down. Psyonix has continued to release content for the game from new arenas, new cars, new cosmetics, to new game modes.Competitive PlayThe eSports focused competitive modes offer ranked 1-v-1, 2-v-2, 3-v-3, and 3-v-3 Solo. The latter of which is all Pickup style games with 6 random players for those who don't have a regular team to play with and would rather not potentially face a coordinated team against a group of random players. The ranking system works well and does a fairly good job at bubble-sorting you to players of similar skill level. The competitive modes have seasons where players strive to climb the ranks and then Psyonix rewards players with some goodies for their rank and everything resets for the start of a new season. They have consistently made some balancing and modifications to how ranked works with each new season so don't be surprised if things change. They really don't make changes during a season other than new cosmetics so you don't have to worry about your ranked experience changing mid-season. For the most part the changes they make tend to improve the overall experience of competitive play, however, that isn't to say they always flawlessly get it right.Casual PlayThe casual modes offer a place to practice and hone your skills or just relax and have a good time. There are the same 1-v-1, 2-v-2, 3-v-3 game types, however, there are a plethora of additional game modes available in casual play that aren't available in the regular rotation of competitive play. uses this as a proving ground for new levels, as well as introducing new game mechanics and modes outside of a ranked competitive setting. You will find experimental levels that are prototyped out in a -like blue & orange wire-frame without putting in the time or effort to texture and theme the arena. There are additional game modes like , , (4-v-4), and more. even added a dash of with the introduction of the much loved game mode which adds a bit of random excitement in the way of power-ups. This can lead to some wild and crazy moments like the following .also has both single player and private multi-player modes where you can customize game settings, such as gravity and ball weight, outside of the matchmaking system. There is also a good single player tutorial mode that will help you learn and practice more advance levels of play, such as aerials. There are also a plethora of UCC tutorials like this available from the Steam Workshop.is cross-platform for matchmaking with players from consoles to PC able to play side-by-side. This helps increase the total player population so you can always find a match, however, there are some downsides due to the differences in platform that make communication challenging. The primary of which is that console players only have the system so you can't message them more verbosely. There are some good console players so don't let PCMR go to your head. This is one of the few cross-platform games that does an overall good job, largely due to the game play works well with a controller so there isn't a huge control disadvantage like there is with cross-platform FPS.is a fairly unique game that is a lot of fun, can be frustrating, and offers a lot of room for skill improvement. It is a game that is incredibly easy to pickup and get into, then 6 hours and 40 matches later you realize you've been saying for the last 20 matches and you have yet to eat. Cosmetics are totally optional and do not impact game play. There is a large amount of items and a vibrant community of people trading in the Trading Steam Discussion board. If you are looking for a game to just blow off some steam, or you are looking for something to scratch that competitive itch has a lot to offer. I highly recommend it and would also encourage you to get some friends to pick it up as well since it is a great game to play with a team."

33,643.2,Recommended," January 18, 2017",2,"So i still like the game after 300 h plus, but to be helpful here, there are many cons (which are less then the pros but anyways) for example: if you are new to the game and just trying to learn the basics and stuff, you have no other choice then going into casual 2v2 and play this for the next 50h. Between the searches for a match you need to train in the free training mode to advance your skills (but this is just a tipp so you dont have to) otherwise your will be addicted to whiff around in a match.The community has changed its face, especialy in the lower ranks from ""bronze"" to ""gold"" and its nearly impossible to get over gold when playing solo queue if you have less then 500 hours, to a mainly toxic and ""cod like"" atmosphere.All in all: i recommend it when you want to play a good comp game with your friends and if you enjoy 1v1s the most in games."

67,"1,189.1",Recommended," November 25, 2016",2,"Now, I have had the game for almost a year; and now I think is the time to decide Rocket League's fate... There are many things that Rocket League is good at, and others not so much. Psyonix did a great job with game experience, graphics, and not so much the Compet. system (in some ways more than others)Rocket league has a fenominal experience... A great theme song to launch the game, and the vibe gives you excitement, you're ready to play the game... But hold your horses! You need to first learn how to play! (All though it could be improved) It's great, lets you learn the basic controls and get a grasp on what you're playing. An exciting game, and very competitive, and aggresive if you let it. You can be pretty much anyone you want to be in the game, to an extent, be a Merc, blowing everyone up, or be in the New Type-S and do Freestyle dribble goals rocking your certified Parylax Mystery Decal. It's rewarding, especially when it takes nearly a year fo ryou to get to Rising Star. You get so pumped when you know you've made it all worth the wait, hard work, and endlessly farming XP to gloat you're a higher level than them... And all of this... 580.7 hours on a Blue Star. Maybe a Season 2 Rocket Trail or two, but seriously? We've become blind from the fact that we spend all of our time... staring into an screen. Just 5 more minutes... Always the same thing...And what else could add to the already unbelieveable amount of detail and finishing touches? Graphics. They are astonishingly good for what this game is. I have never experienced any glitches or faults in the textures, and there are very little ways to screw up the game. This game is VERY well built, and practically troll-proof other than Just messing around by blowing others up into flames, or just trolling the goal hog who keeps saving all of your air dribbles. I have yet to experience any glitches like going thorugh the wall above the goal like others have, but it seems very hard to do, and I'm sure has been patched. They have been pushing out new content constantly, and are like a well-oiled machine. They never stop. New decals here, New Crates there, and a whole new trading system everywhere. Cross-network integration is seemless, Other than communication, sadly. Psyonix have done an EXELENT job and I would have been missing out if I had missed this when it got popular! (But missed Alpha items) Sadly.Though, there are tons of things I LOVE about this game, there are a select few I don't. One of those is part of the competitive system. But before we hate on psyonix, lets thing positively. Servers are rarely down, matchmaking is always getting improved, and Rage Quiters get what the deserve. But these are the good things, and the only bad thing is about Internet. and Power outages, Lost connection, or bad ping. All of these are counted against you, immediately ranking down one division. This sucks. A lot. Especially with my spotty Internet, It's gone down and back up 9 times in the past 2 hours, and have to wait until Sunday. Luckily, I was able to rejoin the game most of the time. a couple times I got disconnected and divisioned down. And eventually after the 3rd disconnect, I lost my rising star rank and spent the next 2 hours (after a motum restart which seemed to temporarily fix the problem) I spent trying to rank up to rising star again, not knowing when season 3 ends. I know Psyonix can't do much about this as I'd rather get punished for something I did not deserve than a quiter not getting what they deserve.Overall, a FANTASTIC game, great everything from support, to forums. They have great gameplay and community, graphics and cross-play is seemless. I give this game easily a 10/10. Even it has some negatives, There are no games in the world of 7.4 billion people that could exist. Nothing is perfect, and as soon as you realize that, the better."

180,12.9,Recommended, January 24,2,"TL:DR? - Definetely recommendedAhhh Rocket League (Don't let my hours fool you, i have spend most of my hours on the PS4 version)Gameplay:The gameplay of Rocket League is simple and easy to learn but hard to master. As somone who has played Rocket League since launch, i must admit that even after 2,5 years the gameplay is still refreshing and hard to become a master at mainly because you will always find a new method to work around the maps. To be plain and simple the gameplay is fun,solid and addictive and also got some stuff to master which keeps the gameplay fresh and new everytime.Graphics:Graphics are good not anything groundbreaking. But the game is very well optimised though some maps can kill the FPS a bit but other then that it's a good looking game.Sound and music:Oh man my favorite part of the game. This is one of the few games where i will literally stay in the menu before finding a match just to finish the song playing in the background. Sound design is also very good, while the vanilla cars sounds good i will admit that the DLC car sounds are a bit better.DLC:While they are not required to enjoy the game i must admit there is some cool DLC cars that is worth the price they are asking.Conclusion?In my eyes Rocket League is a solid game that is easily worth the price it's asking, and if you have the spare cash for it on sale i would say it's the best time to purchase it, it's a solid game you can pick up and easily suck hours in to and it's fun to play with friends too.Welp that's the end of my review i hope you enjoyed it."

Lets throw in some trick jumps and nitro cars, oh and boosting! Lots and lots of boosting!""So, what is Rocket League? I guess we'll start there.Rocket League is a football racing hybrid game, you are one of up to 8 high flying, boosting nitro cars playing on either Team Blue or Team Orange. Your objective? Put the ball in the back of the goal more times than your opponents, 4v4 is the way to play this game and it is exhilarating to say the least when there are 8 high speed cars rushing for the ball going at who knows how many miles per hour.The control and movement is fantastic, It manages to maintain it's familiar car driving feel but the developers have added a number of features to add to football element which are very easy to pick up and learn, you can jump and flip in any direction to try and intercept any potential enemy goals, you can double tap your jump button dash forward to gain even more speed, you can boost to crash into the opposing team to potentionally take them out of the match for a brief moment, heck you can drive on the cieling if you wanted to! The game will refuse to give you any moment of pause, adding to an even more intense feeling.The graphics I love, it's very bright, cheery and filled with life with abstract patterns and great field designs, ranging from day to night, weather effects, large arenas filled with roaring crowds and wide open grassy pitches, sound design is just as exhilarating as the game itself, the crowd never lets up, the satisfying sound of the ball exploding when a goal is scored and the engines of your cars getting ready to charge to the middle of the arena will make you narrow your eyebrows and grin as you prepare to crash into your opposition.Customisation is a worthy thing to note as well, there are many car bodies, exhaust fumes, patterns, cosmetics and colours for you to pick from to make your nitro striker truly your own and bodies do not come with stats, meaning that you can use the body that YOU want to use, not because it has +5 acceleration. Your customisation will be limiting at first, but there is even more to unlcok by simply playing the game and gaining levels, so replayability? ✓.There is a reason why this game is so popular right now, I rarely write reviews after purchase but I can honestly see this game going places, It's fast, it's fun, it's exhilarating and competitive. Thanks to multi-platform integration with PS4, there'll never be a shortage of people to play! If you are at all on the fence about this, I honestly recommend you give it a try. the value is more than most Triple A titles these days and provided you like cars, football or both, you will have a blast."

1,"1,069.9",Recommended," November 25, 2017",2,"SummaryRocket League is instantly familiar and easy to grasp while being incredibly hard to master. The term Rocket-Powered Soccer Cars sums up the core element of the game. The main draw to the game is the online multi-player eSports style of play. Quick 5 minute matches, whether casual or competitive, can be incredibly intense with Epic Saves, Aerial Dribbles, and Sniper Precise Long-Shots. All-in-all Rocket League is a quick pickup-n-play game that is hard to put down. Psyonix has continued to release content for the game from new arenas, new cars, new cosmetics, to new game modes.Competitive PlayThe eSports focused competitive modes offer ranked 1-v-1, 2-v-2, 3-v-3, and 3-v-3 Solo. The latter of which is all Pickup style games with 6 random players for those who don't have a regular team to play with and would rather not potentially face a coordinated team against a group of random players. The ranking system works well and does a fairly good job at bubble-sorting you to players of similar skill level. The competitive modes have seasons where players strive to climb the ranks and then Psyonix rewards players with some goodies for their rank and everything resets for the start of a new season. They have consistently made some balancing and modifications to how ranked works with each new season so don't be surprised if things change. They really don't make changes during a season other than new cosmetics so you don't have to worry about your ranked experience changing mid-season. For the most part the changes they make tend to improve the overall experience of competitive play, however, that isn't to say they always flawlessly get it right.Casual PlayThe casual modes offer a place to practice and hone your skills or just relax and have a good time. There are the same 1-v-1, 2-v-2, 3-v-3 game types, however, there are a plethora of additional game modes available in casual play that aren't available in the regular rotation of competitive play. uses this as a proving ground for new levels, as well as introducing new game mechanics and modes outside of a ranked competitive setting. You will find experimental levels that are prototyped out in a -like blue & orange wire-frame without putting in the time or effort to texture and theme the arena. There are additional game modes like , , (4-v-4), and more. even added a dash of with the introduction of the much loved game mode which adds a bit of random excitement in the way of power-ups. This can lead to some wild and crazy moments like the following .also has both single player and private multi-player modes where you can customize game settings, such as gravity and ball weight, outside of the matchmaking system. There is also a good single player tutorial mode that will help you learn and practice more advance levels of play, such as aerials. There are also a plethora of UCC tutorials like this available from the Steam Workshop.is cross-platform for matchmaking with players from consoles to PC able to play side-by-side. This helps increase the total player population so you can always find a match, however, there are some downsides due to the differences in platform that make communication challenging. The primary of which is that console players only have the system so you can't message them more verbosely. There are some good console players so don't let PCMR go to your head. This is one of the few cross-platform games that does an overall good job, largely due to the game play works well with a controller so there isn't a huge control disadvantage like there is with cross-platform FPS.is a fairly unique game that is a lot of fun, can be frustrating, and offers a lot of room for skill improvement. It is a game that is incredibly easy to pickup and get into, then 6 hours and 40 matches later you realize you've been saying for the last 20 matches and you have yet to eat. Cosmetics are totally optional and do not impact game play. There is a large amount of items and a vibrant community of people trading in the Trading Steam Discussion board. If you are looking for a game to just blow off some steam, or you are looking for something to scratch that competitive itch has a lot to offer. I highly recommend it and would also encourage you to get some friends to pick it up as well since it is a great game to play with a team."

104,579.7,Recommended," July 3, 2017",2,"IF you've never played Rocket League, like many other good games you're probably going to be dog♥♥♥♥♥♥when you first start. You'll first join the tutorial and start touching the ball, yea it feels good we know. Then you decide you'll give online a go, REAllY see what this ♥♥♥♥♥ is about. You're first game online you get 2 clears and a center ball, pretty raunchy. You decide to tax yourself on another game and press rematch. You give a great pass to your team mate, wou lose 1-2. You continue to play online even though you have no idea what the ♥♥♥♥ you're doing but for some reason you can't stop playing it. Then you start to progress and get better and learn to manipulate the car and the ball in ways you've never seen, and fly(Did I mention you could ♥♥♥♥ing fly). You then start to forget about where you came from and whether or not you even liked the damn game to begin with. You slowly then being training every day before work or school, practicing aerials and dribbling in free play mode. The ball slowly becomes a part of you. You become the rank of ""Pro"" and you're feeling pretty damn hot right now♥♥♥♥♥♥ even scalding. You slowly climb the ranks and descend into the madness that is rocket league. Then the itch starts. You'll be at work or out running errands thinking about how much better time could be spent playing rocket league. When you see a subaru on the road, it's not a subaru to you anymore it's now a Takumi. When you go to bed you dream of Rocket League. Now we go back to the original question of whether or not you would like this game? You'll ♥♥♥♥ing love it, too much. The developers, Psyonix, are incredibly good at listening to what the community wants. Each update they continue to push out more and more content and the game is growing everyday. So many funny options to decorate and customize your cars, from toppers to antennas. You can unlock items in game and craft rarer, more exclusive items from those. You dont have to good at rocket league to like it, you just have to be better at having fun. I have made so many memories off this $20 purchase. Like how the hell are they only charging $20 for this game its incredible. I Have put more time and heart into this game on PC and Xbox then any of the main AAA titles that I used to play, and I probably won't stop. Buy this game. Play this game. Love this game."

622,183.3,Recommended," December 18, 2017",2,"What an epic game. So much fun!First of all it runs fantastic on Linux, at least for me, I've had zero issues with it, including split screen with xbox controllers, everything has just worked great.Second, it's just bloody great fun. In the beginning, through the training and so it does feel like you'll never hit anything but with time the skill slowly comes.For me the Casual match play, 3v3 and 2v2 modes have generally matched me against people of the same or slightly better skill level. Basically if you win it seems you play higher skilled people and if you're losing well, the game will tend to match you with lower ranks. That's how it feels anyway.I can't speak to the Ranked play as it doesn't really interest me but I understand that could be where the meat and potatoes of the game are. I'll surely give it a go one day.The other game modes are fun too.. Dropshot and Hoops really change things up and are simple once you understand the concept.And that's just it.. Rocket League is deceptively simple, though it's possible to achieve a level of skill here, through play and practice that really sets it apart from other games I generally play.It's accessible, fun and rewarding especially when you eventually can hit those epic shots.Throughout play you're awarded with various items of purely cosmetic random loot to adorn your car with hats, paint jobs and doodads, and yes, there is a loot box (crate) system. I've found this quite fair to be honest and it never has got in the way - there's plenty of free stuff to be had and if you don't want to get involved with opening crates with keys or whatever there's an option to just hide them from the inventory permanently, so you never see them amongst your stuff. My understanding is the sale of keys goes towards developing the game further and the prize fund for the most competitive level of play for teams.Highly recommend this."

Buy this game. Oh my god, buy this game."
330,554.1,Recommended," July 20, 2015",2,"Rocket League is the best multiplayer game I've ever played. It's so addicting and incredibly satisfying to pull off a good play. At first it'll feel really clumsy, but as you get the hang of it and learn to play with a bit of finesse, you realize how incredibly high the skill ceiling is. There's no nonsense here, just a simple premise with really tight controls.My *only* issue with the game is that the devs don't seem to understand how to expand on it. They just set and forget new modes which turn into ghost towns, and are constantly throwing the baby out with the bathwater when rolling back on controversial features. I'm still bummed that they completely removed mutator playlists instead of tweaking them a bit. They could've taken the time to come up with better variants and rotated them over time instead of every match so they could feel like a bit of a special event. Instead they were like ""nope, people don't like cube ball or beach ball, throw it all in the trash."" Now mutators are useless unless you can organize a match with at least 3-5 other people.Still, though, I give it an . Just hire me to make your decisions, Psyonix."

67,"1,189.1",Recommended," November 25, 2016",2,"Now, I have had the game for almost a year; and now I think is the time to decide Rocket League's fate... There are many things that Rocket League is good at, and others not so much. Psyonix did a great job with game experience, graphics, and not so much the Compet. system (in some ways more than others)Rocket league has a fenominal experience... A great theme song to launch the game, and the vibe gives you excitement, you're ready to play the game... But hold your horses! You need to first learn how to play! (All though it could be improved) It's great, lets you learn the basic controls and get a grasp on what you're playing. An exciting game, and very competitive, and aggresive if you let it. You can be pretty much anyone you want to be in the game, to an extent, be a Merc, blowing everyone up, or be in the New Type-S and do Freestyle dribble goals rocking your certified Parylax Mystery Decal. It's rewarding, especially when it takes nearly a year fo ryou to get to Rising Star. You get so pumped when you know you've made it all worth the wait, hard work, and endlessly farming XP to gloat you're a higher level than them... And all of this... 580.7 hours on a Blue Star. Maybe a Season 2 Rocket Trail or two, but seriously? We've become blind from the fact that we spend all of our time... staring into an screen. Just 5 more minutes... Always the same thing...And what else could add to the already unbelieveable amount of detail and finishing touches? Graphics. They are astonishingly good for what this game is. I have never experienced any glitches or faults in the textures, and there are very little ways to screw up the game. This game is VERY well built, and practically troll-proof other than Just messing around by blowing others up into flames, or just trolling the goal hog who keeps saving all of your air dribbles. I have yet to experience any glitches like going thorugh the wall above the goal like others have, but it seems very hard to do, and I'm sure has been patched. They have been pushing out new content constantly, and are like a well-oiled machine. They never stop. New decals here, New Crates there, and a whole new trading system everywhere. Cross-network integration is seemless, Other than communication, sadly. Psyonix have done an EXELENT job and I would have been missing out if I had missed this when it got popular! (But missed Alpha items) Sadly.Though, there are tons of things I LOVE about this game, there are a select few I don't. One of those is part of the competitive system. But before we hate on psyonix, lets thing positively. Servers are rarely down, matchmaking is always getting improved, and Rage Quiters get what the deserve. But these are the good things, and the only bad thing is about Internet. and Power outages, Lost connection, or bad ping. All of these are counted against you, immediately ranking down one division. This sucks. A lot. Especially with my spotty Internet, It's gone down and back up 9 times in the past 2 hours, and have to wait until Sunday. Luckily, I was able to rejoin the game most of the time. a couple times I got disconnected and divisioned down. And eventually after the 3rd disconnect, I lost my rising star rank and spent the next 2 hours (after a motum restart which seemed to temporarily fix the problem) I spent trying to rank up to rising star again, not knowing when season 3 ends. I know Psyonix can't do much about this as I'd rather get punished for something I did not deserve than a quiter not getting what they deserve.Overall, a FANTASTIC game, great everything from support, to forums. They have great gameplay and community, graphics and cross-play is seemless. I give this game easily a 10/10. Even it has some negatives, There are no games in the world of 7.4 billion people that could exist. Nothing is perfect, and as soon as you realize that, the better."

But when it comes to ranked, it's a whole different story. The way you rank up is terrible. I won a game, but didn't rank up. Okay, I'm fine with that. But tell me how the next game, I lose and I drop the divisions?! I was gold 2 division 2, then dropped to gold 1 division 4. That's insane. I just don't get it.When they add a new game mode, it's fun for about a week, then gets super boring. Now all they add are new crates and every once in a while a new game mode that is only fun for a little while."

1,215.3,Recommended," November 24, 2016",2,"Most fun as a casual game, but can also be challenging and competitiveAll the reviews that say: ""easy to play, hard to master"" are true. At its core, Rocket League may seem as just football with rocket cars, but the more you play the more you realise the potential metagame. Sure, you can just rush for the ball and hope for a lucky shot, but that also results in chaos gameplay. So you have to think in advance and anticipate your opponents move. Positioning and rotation with your teammates is essential and if you want to be good, you have to practice a lot. It plays fine with keyboard + mouse as a casual game, however I recommend a controller for more advanced moves and aerials.Rocket League uses Unreal Engine 3 so it looks great. I was impressed by the attention to certain details, such as individual strands of grass on the pitch and the animated background of the arena. Also, the soundtrack is memorable. Performance is really good even on older systems. Has a solid community on PC and because it is cross-platform with PS4 you can easily find a match at any hour.The developer, Psyonix, is always adding new content, cosmetic items and other game modes such as hockey or basketball. DLC's are also available and present a certain theme. The maps/arenas in the DLC's are free for everyone - very nice and it doesn't split the community."

394,52.1,Recommended, April 12,2,"Skillful, fun and quick sporting game with a continuously growing community and developing team. One of a kind title which runs smoothly on minimal specs.✔️ You'll have fun at any skill level✔️ Cosmetic drops in-game are frequent and don't affect the gameplay✔️ Simple and effective concept worked out well by devs❌ No steam-market integration to trade items❌ Can't spectate you friends' games❌ Global voice chat enabled by default"
141,35.2,Recommended," December 9, 2016",2,"Just an absolute joy to play. It's RC cars with jet packs, slamming into giant soccer balls to really good techno. Purely multiplayer.Rocket League is just one of those games I can put on after an exhausting day at work and have nothing but fun, win or lose. It is a GAME. It makes you yell and cringe and move your head around without thinking about it. It's a video game at the level of immediate, rewarding fun as like Tetris or Mario or Doom. You ask people to play it like you'd ask them if they want to fire off a bunch of firecrackers."
103,226.9,Recommended," October 21, 2015",2,"TL;DR: The game itself is very good, but the AI is wonky and the competitive community is terrible.

21,565.8,Recommended," March 19, 2017",2,"I just want to say, as an almost-addict, do NOT buy this game if you easily get addicted to games. You will easily spend 8 hours in a single night trying to learn new mechanics, or practicing that one annoying shot you can't get down. Now, if you are going to buy this game, I'd just like to say that the best things to do with this game are watch youtube videos (and the pros), and practice consistently (but not 8 hours in a night hopefully). But anyways, here comes the real review of the game.Pros:Low priceEasy to run for most computersFun, short gamesThe ability to play offline is nice for beginners or at times without wifiWorks on MacOS and Linux/SteamOSDoesn't get boring after you get into itHas controller supportMajor eSports teams are fun to followSo many car options will make your poor friends drool all over their keyboardThe skill ceiling leaves room to improve for even the prosThere are multiple game modes that keep the game entertainingThis is a really fun and innovative way to step away from first-person shooters and all those other popular games. If you think about it, how many games out there are car based that aren't racing?Cons:Not cross compatible (I know PC can play with PS4, but they can't party up or even chat together)Servers (PSYONIX PLEASE!!!)Toxic communitySome bodies (cars) cannot be achieved just by playing gamesRanking system isn't all that good, with the skill gap sometimes matching lower ranked players with high ranked players. Rocket league uses something called MMR, or matchmaking rating, to match players. In an attempt to prevent smurfing, players who have been dropping (due to being out of it, or whatever) and have, say, 400 MMR, can sometimes get matched with those who have 600, an unfair skill gap. This happened to me consistently in 1s, and this is the major downfall of Rocket League. I know Psyonix is trying to fix it, but I just have to stress that this... well, is a painIn-game items can't be sold on steam, and it's impossible to trade with PS4 players or people who aren't on your friend listOverall opinion: I really like this game. Although it can be frustrating at times, having friends who play with you makes this game worth the price, and then some. I personally would've bought this game at $30 if I had to. For someone who doesn't like to spend money, I definitely think this is worth most people's time."

1,215.3,Recommended," November 24, 2016",2,"Most fun as a casual game, but can also be challenging and competitiveAll the reviews that say: ""easy to play, hard to master"" are true. At its core, Rocket League may seem as just football with rocket cars, but the more you play the more you realise the potential metagame. Sure, you can just rush for the ball and hope for a lucky shot, but that also results in chaos gameplay. So you have to think in advance and anticipate your opponents move. Positioning and rotation with your teammates is essential and if you want to be good, you have to practice a lot. It plays fine with keyboard + mouse as a casual game, however I recommend a controller for more advanced moves and aerials.Rocket League uses Unreal Engine 3 so it looks great. I was impressed by the attention to certain details, such as individual strands of grass on the pitch and the animated background of the arena. Also, the soundtrack is memorable. Performance is really good even on older systems. Has a solid community on PC and because it is cross-platform with PS4 you can easily find a match at any hour.The developer, Psyonix, is always adding new content, cosmetic items and other game modes such as hockey or basketball. DLC's are also available and present a certain theme. The maps/arenas in the DLC's are free for everyone - very nice and it doesn't split the community."

71,619.4,Not Recommended," August 7, 2017",2,"I've played this game now for about 135 hours, which is really a lot by my standards - it's definitely one of the most played games by me. This ought to show, that I'm not a gamer in a typical sense, mostly due to the fact that I don't have so much spare time for gaming - I'm in my early thirties now and have other hobbies/duties too. However, this game is really fun and addicting - it has relative easy ""learning curve"", good mechanics and a lot of fast action - just jump into any game and the action will start immediately! It's a lot of fun playing with your friends locally as a couch co-op or against random people online.Now to the negative part - the more you play the better you will become according to the game's ranking system and the better you are the better online opponents you will get. There's basically two online modes you can play - casual or competitive (ranked). In casual mode you will earn points and will get titles depending on how long you've played that game in total. This basically means that the more you play the ""older"" opponents/team-members you will get. There's a high chance that you will get someone in your (or opposite) team, who I would call a ""wannabe-pro"" - someone who wants to become a pro, but for whatever reason hasn't become one (yet?). They tend to be really personal and rude against other players (especially their own team-mates) if any of them makes any mistakes at all. They expect everyone to be pros like them and if that's not the case, then you are either a retard or should uninstall this game or both. If you're one of these so called wannabe-pro's I'm describing here then let me tell you - everyone has paid money to play this game and have an equal right to play it. Not everyone has time or plans to become as pro as you do, but they play it for fun and entertainment. If you don't like that kind of team-members and want to become a real pro then I strongly suggest you to find yourself stable team-members so that you can practice together daily and not hope that any random player will perform as expected in any situation. It's you who should uninstall this game if you can't control your anger nor find yourself stable team-members to practice with. It's even worse in ranked mode where obnoxiousness-level is a lot higher since there's more to lose (your rank, namely).As far as I know, then the game does not allow you to reset your ranks/levels - you either progress (always true in casual mode) or rise/drop in rank depending on your own and/or your (random) team-members in competitive mode. This means that to lower toxicity in the game you should lose deliberately in ranked games to get random newcomers as your opponents (even though ""unranked"" players can be long-time players too). That's not how I imagine a good game to be.There exists a report functionality within the game for rude behaviour and I've usually reported these wannabe-pro's, but I've not seen it have any effect and don't know if it does anything at all. It would be nice to see something happen to these players in the end, since they just ruin the whole gaming experience.Oh, don't get me wrong, there are real pros, who can't be bothered to use rude language if (someone lower than them) makes mistakes and might give you some tips how to perform better.I'm still playing this game since it's too addictive, but I hope that toxicity levels will decrease in the future. Play it as a fun game or become a pro instead of being rude!If you're for some quick and occasional games then definitely get this game, but if you're looking for long playing hours without having a goal of becoming a real pro then this game might not be for you due to the possible toxicity levels. Definitely ""Not Recommended"" if you can't take losses as a real man (or woman)."

363,"1,687.2",Recommended," December 6, 2016",2,"The Greatest God Damn Review EverIntroduction/TL;DR EditionWhat is this car ball looking game?I remember when Rocket League first released on Steam in 2015. I took a look at the store page, saw it was mostly football related and instantly moved on. It wasn't until my friend bought it and told me how much fun he was having while playing it, and well, since we do everything together, I decided to buckle up like a buckaroo and buy it. Over a year later and 1,500+ hours and I can say with all my confidence that Rocket League is the greatest game I've ever played and spent the most time on. Rocket League is extremely unique in it's playstyle, meaning that no two games will be the same, it's unpredictable and extremely fun. The modes range from offline play, to 1v1 online all the way up to 4v4 online.I tend to review a lot of games when I get the chance to and usually, they're better structured than this one, but by not buying this game, you are well and truly missing out. Psyonix are amazing developers and constantly provide free updates such as mutators, to the recently released rumble mode, they do a lot for the community and constantly keep their game interesting and fun to play, it would easily be the best money you spent on purchasing a game.Well, there is no other part to this review to really talk about. The product is advertised perfectly and the screenshots and videos provided on this store page should be enough to show you what this is all about. If not, search on YouTube and look at the RLCS to see what some of the best players in Rocket League play like.It's unique, it's great to just pickup and play for five minutes, or to pickup and not put down for two hours. Do yourself a favour and buy this game, I really can't be more clear about how much everyone in the world should play Rocket League."
2,17.1,Recommended," January 16, 2016",2,"I never had an interest in this game, but a mate gifted me a copy for Christmas so I thought I would give it a go. I can honestly say that I'm glad I did give it a go, and I am happy he gifted it to me, it is bloody great fun. Especially when you have a bunch of mates all playing together and half of them aren't worried about the ball, all they want to do is get 'demolition' on each other.The reason I had no interest in this game was because I have no interest in soccer at all, I can appreciate the game, but I would rather watch a game of rugby. I can say the same about soccer games on the computer. When I was a younger every platform had a plethora of soccer games, and I did not like any of them, I did however labour along with the crappy union and league games available.However, in the early 90's a company called Sensible Software came out with a game called Sensible Soccer (Sensi) and it was great fun. This game reminds me of those days.The premise is simple, but is executed so well. Combining rocket powered cars with a ball and a net at each end of a paddock is a recipe for pure fun.Easily one of the most simple, yet enjoyable games I have played in a long time. Buy it, fill the fridge full of beer and strap into your favourite armchair, because you will have a ball.4/5"

49,428.6,Recommended," November 21, 2017",2,"This game is a testament on how a small team of dedicated and talented individuals can beat enterprise-level companies that have unbelievable budgets at their disposal.Being off-put by the overall theme of the game (I never liked cars, nor football), I could not force myself to buy the game, even with its low price. That all changed by giving the game a chance on a weekend on which it was free. My overall perception of the game changed immediately.For a game in which you have freedom in all three dimensions it feels so right and fluid. The gameplay flow and the controls represent an epitome of good design decisions implement with care. Flying in the air and scoring aerial goals is such an amazing injection of adrenaline that keeps me wanting for more. The difficulty curve is there and, in the beginning, it feels as your car is rigid, but after a few weeks and months you get the hang of it and you forget about the controller in your hands and you just… play.The months I have put into this game are months that I do not regret, since every month feels fresh and different. At the first few levels players strive to be the first to have a say in where the ball goes creating chaotic situations in which all players are in a small portion of the playing field. Players who first develop the skills to fly are the first to conquer the playing field between the floor and the ceiling and, as time goes on, they get introduced to more and more players knowing how to play in mid-air. Many levels later, the game takes on a new level of play in which players calculate the trajectory of the ball in mid-air in order to propell themselves and fly for many seconds at a time before passing the ball to a teammate who is already in mid-air waiting for the ball in order to land a shot.New content and fixes that keep getting added have fleshed out the experience even more. The microtransactions are tolerable since they are left only for cosmetics. All other content is freely given to players who own the game, without making them pay extra.In all sincerity and gratitude, I applaud Psyonix at their never-ending flow of effort and good-will put into this beautiful little game.

I gave it a shot, played it with a friend got my♥♥♥♥♥stomped forabout 20 hours. Told my friends about it, everyone bought it. We do 2,3,4's nightlyand even when we get stomped we look forward to the next match for redemption.The fact that AAA devs cannot make a game like this says a lot. There is a lot ofover thinking in todays gaming culture, buzzwords, hype culture. All that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tnone of them is necessary for Rocket League. Its soccer cars. They have a leaguesystem that is is fun to climb and easy to fall out of. The game feels like the rightamount of easy to pick up and play yet incredibly hard to master. This is whatkeeps my friends and I coming back night after night. To yell at eachother andshout like idiots when we pull off some amazing move we have never done before.Its teamwork. Simple team work and my god is it rewarding. For 30 bucks? Thisgame is a steal and a half. I bought all the DLC which is all cosmetic becuse thebase game was so god damn good I had to suppor the developers further. Thatsays to me that they have made something special in a market cluttered bycookie cutter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and everyones charging full ♥♥♥♥ing price.The problems with the game are minor but need to be addressed. I play onthe mouse and keyboard (yes I am ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥) and the input delay/negation ofthe right mouse button commands (which effect jumping) are awful. I thoughtit was my mouse dying at first. So I bought a new mouse, same thing happenedlooked on the forums. Its a known game issue. If you are using a controlleryou will be fine though. Next problem, pings and matchmaking. Pings seema bit irratic even being on the same region but that is to be expected I suppose.Matchmaking seems off as we can have a fantastic match in game 1, then ingames 2-4 we get rickrolled completely. Little things that need to be finetuned and everythings fine. So no major complaints.If you have buddies you like to game with, and want a simple yet challenginggame pick this sucker up. You owe it to yourselves.Rocket League gets 9 out of 10 from me in every regard. Nearly the perfectgame overall and the best Indie game I have ever played.GO BUY IT"

118,320.0,Recommended, April 19,2,"Advantages :- Atypical and well thought out- Immediate fun- A must-have for quick games with friends- Online friendly- Simple, rather pretty, and quite freneticDrawbacks :- Not revolutionary for a penny compared to its predecessor- A bit expensive for what he has to offer (knowing that his ancestor was sold 2 times cheaper on release)- Would have liked a little more depth in the gameplay and in the content- AI is totally zero or far too precise and effectiveSummary :Rocket League takes full responsibility as a result of a delusional UFO and offers the same concept, brought up to date. If the solo experience leaves a little taste of frustration, because of a limited life and an AI sometimes completely zero sometimes too precise depending on the level of difficulty chosen, the true potential of the game is clearly revealed in multiplayer. Offering a split screen mode that can accommodate up to 4 players and online up to 8, Rocket League puts us in the heart of an atypical sport, served by a basic gameplay that will still require some control and a bit of strategy if we want to build a qualitative and spectacular game. A good pick for the evenings between friends."

85,"1,154.9",Recommended, April 18,2,"I'm pretty much obligated to write this review at this point. I've never spent so much time playing a video game. I'm at 1,100 hours and there's no signs that I'll ever stop playing. This game is that good.I saw a review of this game somewhere that I can't help but echo. I don't know who wrote it or where it was written, but there's no better description of this game. Rocket League isn't a sports game, it is a sport. In other sports games, you have a button to press when you want to pass, there's a button to shoot, there's a button to tackle, etc. In Rocket League, however, all you get is your basic driving controls (i.e., steering, accelerating, stopping/decelerating, power slide, etc.) and a few extras like jump and dodge. All passing, shooting, dribbling, faking, and juking is done with those controls. If you want to pass the ball, you have to learn how. If you want to shoot the ball, you have to learn how. If you want to dribble, you have to learn how. Do you think you'll get bored after you learn how to do all those things? Think again! The meta is constantly and organically evolving to incorporate newer and more advanced mechanics like flicking, ceiling shots, wave-dashes, and a never-ending supply of mind-games and jukes. No matter how good you get at Rocket League, there's always that next mountain to climb. There's always another mechanic you can learn to improve your game. I can honestly say that I don't think I'll ever get bored of this game. Get some buddies together and buy it. This game is more fun with friends."

2,85.1,Not Recommended, April 13,2,"I downloaded this game about 3 months ago, one of the best phisics car games I have ever played.But since the last automatic upgrade, for me It's impossible to play anymore. Lags a lot, the ping is really high, suddenly I find myself out of a match with a warning message stating that there are no servers online so it's impossible even to search for a new match to play, it always appears ""losing data"" or "" latency difference"" signal, the FPS are lowered from static 60 to dynamic 20/30. I am not the only one to have these issues. Since the last upgrade most of the users are reporting negative feedbacks.this game has become really BAD."
15,100.2,Not Recommended, April 21,2,"The game itself can be very fun, but don't bother with it until they fix their matchmaking and support. Made it to gold status playing in leagues, and since I have had 9 games 2v3 in a row because there is no penalty at all for just bailing on a game. Couple that with the fact that their reporting of cheaters means absolutely nothing and you have a great game turned terrible by the company that makes it. How you can report someone for obvious cheating (blocking their own team and playing goalie for the other team) and then be matched up with them 3 games in a row after that is beyond me. Sad and disgusting, but EA gives better support than these guys do."
79,4.2,Recommended," July 9, 2015",6,"Rocket League is a football (soccer) game where your player is a RC car. The concept of the game is simple and very enjoyable. Even though they reccomend you to play with a controller, I found that the keyboard and mouse controls were easy to use so I did'nt bothered playing with a controller. There are ALOT of car customisation so you can make your own car look unique and unlock more items as you level up. Multiplayer is fun. There is a casual mode where you play for fun in 1v1 2v2 3v3 and 4v4. And if you are a competitive person there is a ranked mode where you can play 1v1 2v2 and 3v3. Single player consists of quickmatch with the A.I or local and a season mode. Season mode is well detailed, you can choose your team, how many players per team, how long the season will be and more. Also you can adjust difficulty as you play. There is something for everyone in this game. For a 21$ game it looks amazing the details on the grass and the environment is amazing and it runs smoothly. If you are looking for a fast paced arcade game or if you are a football (soccer) fan, I defenitly reccomend you to buy it!"

I'm at 1,100 hours and there's no signs that I'll ever stop playing. This game is that good.I saw a review of this game somewhere that I can't help but echo. I don't know who wrote it or where it was written, but there's no better description of this game. Rocket League isn't a sports game, it is a sport. In other sports games, you have a button to press when you want to pass, there's a button to shoot, there's a button to tackle, etc. In Rocket League, however, all you get is your basic driving controls (i.e., steering, accelerating, stopping/decelerating, power slide, etc.) and a few extras like jump and dodge. All passing, shooting, dribbling, faking, and juking is done with those controls. If you want to pass the ball, you have to learn how. If you want to shoot the ball, you have to learn how. If you want to dribble, you have to learn how. Do you think you'll get bored after you learn how to do all those things? Think again! The meta is constantly and organically evolving to incorporate newer and more advanced mechanics like flicking, ceiling shots, wave-dashes, and a never-ending supply of mind-games and jukes. No matter how good you get at Rocket League, there's always that next mountain to climb. There's always another mechanic you can learn to improve your game. I can honestly say that I don't think I'll ever get bored of this game. Get some buddies together and buy it. This game is more fun with friends."

89,"1,477.9",Not Recommended," November 17, 2017",6,"This game is really fun, even more fun with friends. It is all you could ask for from a football/soccer video game. There is a ton of customization and in-game purchases are purely cosmetic. Unfortunately, Rocket League has numerous frustrating issues that have gone unfixed for a while now.Community:If you are looking for a game with a loving and open-arms community, this isn't the game for you. You will become overwhelmed with people trying to scam you, swearing at you, insulting you, and insisting how bad you are. Unless you feel like dealing with this, you will be forced to turn off chat right away. Solo-queueing in ranked is extremely difficult because you will often get teammates who want to forfeit 30 seconds into a match. Although the community of Rocket League does slightly take away from the experience, it's hard to blame the developers for this problem.Servers:Connection issues are one of the most frequent complaints you will hear from any Rocket League player; there is a reason why this is the case. Servers aren't much of an issue when you first start playing, but it becomes painfully obvious when you reach higher ranks that the servers can't keep up with the pace of the game. You will often have the ball go straight through your car, hit another player with your car and have them be completely unaffected, and watch as another player hits the ball when they are nowhere near it. Essentially, what you see on your screen is not what is actually happening. All of this ofcourse is if the servers are working in the first place. You can get randomly disconnected from a match, you can be rubberbanding at 40 ping, or you might not be allowed to connect to the servers at all.Updates:Rocket League is updated often enough to where it seems like Psyonix does care about expanding the game and improving the game's performance. Although, they haven't listened to most of the community's suggestions involving new game modes and items. Rocket League would be perfect for a system where players could submit their own created items and have a chance of getting them into the next crate, similar to CS:GO. This is just an idea, but not my major problem with the game's updates. The issue that I DO have with the updates is that they almost always break something in the process, sometimes making the game unplayable. The most recent and well-known example of this was the ""Autumn update"". This update was released and a large portion of the player base could no longer play the game. The response time to this bug was way too long considering how many people it affected. It really makes me wonder how much Psyonix tests their updates considering something like this just slipped through.Overall, Rocket League is an amazing game. This review is meant to warn you about the multiple frustrations and disappointments that you will experience. If these things are enough to drive you away from the game, I suggest that you atleast consider watching the Rocket League eSports which has been put together very well and is a lot of fun to watch.EDIT: This game has since devolved into a laggy, unplayable mess, don't bother getting it."

This is an amazing game and the bots are sometimes challenging but sometimes ridiculous, i would like a level above all-star difficulty as i feel now that it is fairly easy to play against them.

You literally will hit the ball and your car lags and moves to the side of it. You can see it in the cams.-Thin skined people witch hunt and try to get you banned. So many people will maliciously BM and run their mouths, you do the same back, and you probably will get banned. The report system is high tier garbage and makes no sense. I'm convinced you get banned for simply stating swear words. Banning people for words people say on a regular basis is poor player relations, just saying. Banning players for racial slurs and remarks of people harming themselves and such I understand. If you can't handle swear words, get off the internet. We all know you swear too. (The game was actually less toxic and more enjoyable before the new ban system. It's widely abused.)I love this game, but I hate it with a burning passion at the same time."

It is also automated, so after a certain amount of usages of the word f*ck or sh*t, you will get banned from PLAYING THE GAME for 24 hours. not 10 minutes, 15minutes, or 30minutes, a whole 24 hours for text chat. They were too lazy to implement a text chat block, where if you got reported or caught by the automated system they would remove your rights to text chat, but no, they just have to outright ban you from playing the game for 24 hours. If their goal is to prevent toxicity, theyre doing a poor job seeing as how I can insult peoples ability to play by using their quick chat options, or simply typing out something that isnt vulgar. Sure bad toxicity has swears in it, but that doesnt mean its only made up of swears. You go into any match in this game you realize when the enemy team scores they'll spam ""thanks"" or ""nice save"". I, personally, couldnt give a sh*t, it doesnt bother me when they do that, but I know some people actually get triggered by the quick chat because they see it as being taunted.I rarely talk sh*t or taunt others, but the one time I do or the one time I talk in chat to sh*t talk my friends in text chat I get banned from playing.I havent even mentioned how I played money for this game, its not a free service, but my review is getting too long so I wont go on.Tl;dr It's absolutely rediculous that I can get banned from playing the game in its entirity simply because you swore, even if it was towards your own queued up teammates as a joke."

Essentially a simple, well-refined formula, with an arsenal of modern bell and whistles to put it far above the competition. The visuals, audio, netplay, customization, and interface are all a pleasure, but the tactile controls are what really shines. The game encourages you to ""Become one with your vehicle!"" Okay, it doesn't actually say this directly, but its implicit. The whole idea is to use the rocket car as an extension of yourself, the way a tennis player uses their racquet. When you're diving in among everyone else, the anticipation can be enough to make you flinch and jump in your seat. This game is exactly what e-sports needs: more balls and less fluff."

249,956.3,Recommended," June 1, 2016",7,"Rocket Leauge - Psyonix's sequel to their first car-soccer game SARPBC (Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars) - is truly in a class of its own. Soccer meets driving once again in this spectacular masterpiece. In Rocket League every single move and decision have a huge impact on the outcome of the game. Every slight misplay or miscommunication will inevitably lead to a goal for the opponent team and thus change the entire outcome of the game.Communication and teamwork play a huge part in Rocket League. As mentioned above, a slight miscommunication can lead to a goal for the opponent team, hence the importance. Most game modes are focus around teamplay and communication, with the exception of player versus player matches. However, this does not render player versus player matches useless, as mechanical skill, as well as the capability of being good in both offence and defence, is quite important if you want to be good at the game.Rocket League is played competitively all around the world. Several tournaments all around the world are hosted, with the biggest being Rocket League Championship Series (RLCS), which has ever increasing prize pools of hundreds of thousands of dollars. Thousands upon thousands of teams participate in the RLCS tournament, but, as always, there is only one winning team. At the time of writing this review, it’s been three months since the spectacular conclusion of the Rocket League Championship Series (RLCS) Season 2, which saw Flipsid3 Tactics take down the talented players of Mockit Aces in back-to-back series to become the second RLCS World Champions. Participation for RLCS Season 3 has been closed and we're looking forward to an even more incredible third Season!Despite Rocket League's huge focus on competitive gameplay, there are also several non-competitive game modes for people who are simply looking to have some fun. This includes game modes like - an epic battle royale-style addition that comes stacked with randomized power-ups, and - a basketball-inspired game mode that pits players against each other in a 2v2 showdown.Another thing worth mentioning is the incredible efforts made by the game developers Psyonix. Personally, I like to think of Psyonix as some of the best developers out there. Their effort to satisfy every single player is incredible, not to mention how they've given special and personalized items to players who have either achieved something special or found a game-breaking bug. Psyonix's efforts never cease to amaze me - coming from a player who have followed the franchise since a couple of years after the release of SARPBC.If all this doesn't sound exciting enough, there are huge amounts of collectible items which are either obtainable as in-game drops or from Champion Crates. Champion Crates contain exclusive decals, wheels, boost trails, and even Import car bodies and Exotic wheels! This allows for microtransactions, which simply increases the economy of Psyonix, hence their capability of frequently updating the game.All in all Rocket League is definitely my favorite game as of now. There are, however, a few minor things that could be improved. I'm running Rocket League on my laptop which isn't quite the best, so maps like Aqua Dome decrease my FPS by a noticeable amount, which can be quite annoying at times, and sometimes difficult to cope with. Another minor thing that I wish they'd adjust is the fact that sometimes you ""wobble"" upon landing on the ground after an aerial, completely ruining your next move. Overall, though, these bugs are quite minor, and there are very few of them, rendering them almost completely unnoticeable compared to all the amazing and frequent updates that Psyonix releases.★★★★★ / ★★★★★"

But there are things holding this game back.Now, I'm not gonna touch on the server issues or other things, I'm simply focusing on the game itself. Plus, I haven't had server issues, so I can't really talk about those.Let's start with the pros:-Amazing music, though it only plays in menues. So that's a bummer.-Beautiful graphics. Like, seriously, they're amazing.-Controls are excellent. They're easy to learn, and hard to master.-Fantastic with a bunch of friends. Lag's non-existent, for me.-Great concept. I mean, come on, rocket cars? You'd be insane to not love that.-Huge amount of customisation. At least, huge for me. I don't need a billion flags and stuff.-Maps all look different.Sadly, that's where the pros finish. Here are the cons:-Maps are not varied. Not at all. They're all basic, flat maps that have no changes at all between them, save for the looks. SARPBC was made before Rocket League, and the maps are way better. I can see why the maps are why they are, for e-sports, but I wish there were just more fun maps.-Music only in menus. Now, I normally don't have the music on, since I have my own, so this may have been fixed, but it was a bummer when I found it out.So, do I recommend this game? Well, yes. It's extremely fun and even if you have no friends that own it, the bots are fun to play with. Sure, the maps should be much more varied, but they're still fun to play at the moment."
2,32.1,Recommended," August 28, 2015",3,"Rocket League reminds me of some of my favorite SNES games rolled into one: Uniracers, NBA Jam, Battle Soccer, and Rock n' Roll Racing. Essentially a simple, well-refined formula, with an arsenal of modern bell and whistles to put it far above the competition. The visuals, audio, netplay, customization, and interface are all a pleasure, but the tactile controls are what really shines. The game encourages you to ""Become one with your vehicle!"" Okay, it doesn't actually say this directly, but its implicit. The whole idea is to use the rocket car as an extension of yourself, the way a tennis player uses their racquet. When you're diving in among everyone else, the anticipation can be enough to make you flinch and jump in your seat. This game is exactly what e-sports needs: more balls and less fluff."
422,645.6,Recommended," September 20, 2015",3,"Alright, here's the deal.I don't like sports, that includes soccer (obviously). I enjoy racing though (but that's irrelevant unless you want to include 'race for the ball'). I was skeptical about getting this game after watching videos and have to listen to my friends spam me to get this game all the time. So, after awhile I had a friend that was nice enough to buy me this game. Well, here's my review.First startingOkay, you know every game you have to 'learn the controls'? It is inevitable. With Rocket League, the controls are so simple it does not even take 5 minutes to get the hang of it. I got into it instantly.Besides the controls, the game is very simple as the goal is to score as many goals before the timer runs out. It might take some getting used to like aiming the ball and learning what you can do to score.You might not know it at first but you can destroy your opponent if you are going fast enough (boost helps). This is a strategy, but watch out: most people do it over and over again just for no reason! (There needs to be a cooldown imo)GeneralThe game has different modes you can play: Season, Mutators, Exhibition and Online Play with thousands of players. You can also play with AI bots. There's also different sub-modes like 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, etc. Games do get very intense sometimes!Finding games via Online Play does not take long at all. I normally get into games almost instantly or between 10-60 seconds. When you do join a game and it finishes, you will have the option to stay in the game without it taking you out of it.There's also a garage to create WHAT you'd like to use or showoff during games, and a ton of unlocks, like: new cars, paintings, decals, etc. You can also trade in duplicate items you loot at the end of games for better hats, boost and more.My overall opinion of this game overwhelms my scepticism. This is truely an entertaining game that will keep me busy for months. I'd recommend it.Below you will find some of my moments and my friends moments in Rocket League."

334,"1,132.1",Recommended," September 11, 2016",3,"After 500 hours, I can honestly say that Rocket League is my favorite game ever. I know everyone always says it, but this game is so easy to just pick up and play, yet so difficult to master. This game has no skill trees, but the satisfaction you get from mastering a new skill is unmatched by any other game. And just when you think you have mastered a skill, you will find someone who can do it better.Pros:-Easy to play/understand-Difficult to master-Short games-Incredible dev support (new modes and maps constantly being added)-Growing community-Cosmetic customization (hats, boost, wheels, paint, antennas, etc.)-Camera options-Soundtrack-Paid DLC is purely cosmetic. All content updates are free.Cons:-Need to use mouse to invite friends to party.Totally nominated for the ""Just 5 more minutes award."" It has to win that."
