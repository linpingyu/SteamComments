257,57.3,Recommended," June 2, 2017",1,"Cities: Skylines is a very in depth, complex, and well-made city building game. As if you couldn't have guessed that already. It allows you, in its basic state (that being without DLC or mods), to create a city from a fair variety of maps, each with different things going for them such as water quantity, oil reserves, building area etc. Your task is, simply, to get as many people to live in your city, keep them happy, make it as good as you can, and make a load of money. The same as the government’s job, really. Except the ""keeping people happy bit""...yeah...The game allows you to design and expand a city with the use of many tools such as zoning, district planning and other features that let you change the smaller, more intricate details of your city. You can set different laws within your districts to make them work more efficiently at what you want them to do. I feel like this is all done really well. I have not got any DLC's, and only recently did I get a few mods, but I don't feel like the game ever really needed them.Over the course of your cities expansion, you will face challenges. You must supply water, electric and road access to people, and zone your areas well to create a nice amount of residential, commercial and industrial areas. As the demand for them increases, it is expected that you appease them. You will also have to work around the formation of the land that you are on to make your city as functional and as sustainable as it can be, otherwise it will lack in efficiency, and perhaps upset the people. If they don’t like your city, they will first stop paying taxes, making it much harder for you to amend your previous errors. After that, they will leave, and you will be very lonely in that ghost town of yours. And probably quite angry as you’ll have to start a new game again. One problem that is hard to manage is the flow of traffic. You must make reliable and efficient road networks throughout your city, otherwise it will become stagnant. Public services such as busses will be rendered useless, nobody will be able to get to work, and emergency services will be crippled if your roads are congested all the time.As your city progresses in size, the feature is available to you to buy more land, thus enabling you to continue your expansion. Eventually, if you are good enough at this game, you will fill the maximum amount of land you can buy, at which point, you’ll probably be feeling quite proud of yourself. Well done.Overall, I would rate this game a well-earned 10/10. I can’t really fault it on anything. Out of all the city building games out there, this is the most detailed and intricate, while remaining fun to play, and enjoyably challenging. Graphically, it looks great, and the gameplay feels smooth. It has to be the best game of its type."
131,181.9,Recommended," April 19, 2015",1,"In 2013, after 10 years of waiting, the Sim City community of modders, fans, and aficionados rushed out to purchase the fifth installment of Sim City. Ten years is a long time to wait for a game, but people had a lot of faith in Maxis when they announced the title. Long story short, it was a massive dissapointment. Maxis and EA crippled Sim City 5 with DRM, Always On APM, tiny maps, forced origin installation, lacking mod support, no steam support, and a forced multiplayer aspect. I decided to not purchase the title, so it may have been a decent game, but 2 years later a team of 12 people created a game that does everything maxis insisted was utterly and totaly impossible.Everything the mod community did that kept Sim City 4 on the shelves in Wallmarts across America for an entire decade was ignored. Maxis (and to a lesser extent EA) ignored the fans, and gave the people who had kept them in business for twenty years a crippled subpar game. And for that Maxis is now out of business. They will never make another game, and it is no one's fault but theirs.Now pretend none of that happened. It's 2013 again, and here it is people: Sim City 5.The game balance is a bit on the easy side for veterans of the genre, but the potential map size is ENOURMOUS and customizing your city could fill up years of gameplay time. The game runs so smoothly with so much going on, it really shows how lazy Maxis was with their approach. The glass in buildings reflects the sun and the buildings near it, there are dynamic shadows, zoning is back, and it is not 'dumbed down'. A single tile in this game is twice the size of the alloted map in Sim City, and you can purchase dozens of additional tiles to expand. The map editor is awesome, the community is thriving, there are mods to do anything you want, and this is the city building game we've all been waiting for. I can not possibly reccomend this more."
207,65.3,Recommended," March 10, 2015",2,"This is an outstanding game. This is an exceptionally outstanding citybuilder game, in a genre that for too long, has been deeply troubled with over-casualization, poor optimization, ill-thought out concepts, microtransactions, and general publisher shenangans.Positives* Excellent Performance. I find that my city runs extremely well on my laptop even as it grows. I have not really noticed any dips in performance. The game seamlessly transitions between following an entity, and zooming out to broadly appreciate my traffic network.* Intuitive game mechanics. I was able to jump straight in and make assumptions about mechanics that made sense, and those were reflected in the game. As an example, I assumed people would use a variety of methods to get to work (hop on the metro, then take a bus), When I tracked people, they would do this.* Full Simulation. Things just make sense, you build a dam - the water level raises. People go to the store. People go to work. The water gets dirty from pollution. I get a sense that the city is a living and breathing entity - it gives me context to the experience.* Free, Focused Construction. You place roads and zones freely, focused around the placement of the roads. The zones are indelibly linked to this. It was a great design decision and simplifies the more annoying aspects of construction. It also makes the transport very obvious as one of the key aspects of the game.* The listed city population seems much lower than it should be. My city looks like it should be about 100,000 people, but the listed population is only 30,000.* Not enough snapping options. This makes it really hard to make your own cloverleaf in highways if you are particulary OCD about this kind of thing, it's almost impossible to make angles of a similar basis repeatedly.* The Metro + Bus placement lacks feedback and is difficult to expand once done. I feel that you are really fairly blindly approaching this, at least at the start. Over time I might grow to understand this more. Also the numbers don't often line up well. My metro station might say ""100 per week"" but in the overall transport graph only 20 people are said to be using the metro.If you like citybuilders, buy this game. Not since SimCity 4 Rush Hour have I enjoyed an experience this much. I find it hard to suggest major ways to improve the concept. I strongly dislike casual approaches to the genre, and this is not one of those. Yet I also think it makes the genre more accessible."
625,94.2,Recommended," May 19, 2016",388,"For 2 weeks I debated purchasing Cities: Skylines (I'm sure I annoyed most of my friends by weighing the pros and cons with them!) Eventually I said, ""screw it"" and made the purchase: I have not regretted it since.In a nut shell, Cities: Skylines is your basic city simulator. You start off with a blank landscape and a highway off to the side, of which is the key to growing your sprawling city. Sounds very simple, yes? Well, not quite. Cities: Skylines goes beyond just throwing houses and shops together. You're required to check pollutants in the form of ground and noise, dissiptating clogged roadways, providing entertainment, and so much more. Essentially, this game is everything that you could ever ask for in a simulator.---------------------------------------------------------Pros+ Replayability value is here 100%+ Sound effects are great and very life-like+ The graphics, my oh my, the graphics - they are absolutely stunning; if you're able to play on high graphics, then go for it. The view is very rewarding and satisfying. Great job, !+ There is always something to look out for: budgeting, job and housing demands, etc. This game is definitely no joke. It demands your every attention and is not something you can just idle+ Related to the graphics point: I love how this game works so well on my non-gaming laptop. I have a Toshiba E45T which is not one by any means. This game is so well optimised, I can still enjoy it to its fullest though+ The ""basic"" version of offers a lot at a decent price. If your budget is fairly tight, then disregard the unless you really want 5 extra monuments (plus as a way to support the developer's further). You can always get the 5 extra monuments through the workshop± DLC's are a bit pricey and I'm not sure if it's really worth it. In the end, it's your call: comes with some new lanes and a couple edicts, leisure and tourism specializations (night clubs, etc.), and extra buildings. Some people are noting that it comes with a night and day cycle, but I was experiencing the cycle without the DLC... maybe I'm just confusing something!: snow, obviously, hah! Also snowmaps, snowplows and snowpiles, more edicts and heating systems.: In my opinion, the DLC's are not worth it at their full price. Yes, they serve to enhance gameplay and also act as a way for you to support the developer's as well. With the little amount of content that both of them offer, however, and at $12+ price tags, I'd say your money would be better spent elsewhere. So, either wait until the DLC's are cheaper (I'd say under $8 would be more appropriate), avoid the DLC's completely, or just splurge because you want to. If you're an achievement hunter like me, then you'll need to purchase the DLC's.If budget is an issue, then I would suggest getting first. It has been much more enjoyable due to it's far more superior offering of content. Quite frankly, I haven't even really played with since it doesn't offer much beyond its name. It's completely up to you!- Realistic traffic please! (There is a mod for this though)- Can there be an undo button? It would be extremely helpful- Connecting roads can be a real hassle at times, especially when you're looking to upgrade them- Would be very useful if we could just upgrade buildings for a fee, such as the Cargo Harbour to Hub (without having to go through the process of destroying it first)All in all, is honestly one of the best purchases I have ever made to date on Steam. I've already lost 22+ hours since my purchase 4 days ago, and it has left me impressed each time I've exited the game. If you're into simulators, I highly recommend this one - I hope it leaves as much of an impression on you as it has on me.With an abundance of content and a plethora of mods being developed (or already developed), you seriously can't go wrong with this title. Bravo, and , bravo: thank you for this amazing game.9.5/10If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask - I will answer them to the best of my ability. On that note, cheers and happy building!: FREE STADIUM DLC! Thank you, - this game just gets better and better. You never fail to impress with the amount of dedication and love you have for your game.1) Can this game be played offline (credits to ru): Yes, yes this game can be played offline! I've done around 7 hours of gameplay offline (due to power outages). That didn't stop me from getting on this game though!2) Does the game require a lot of attention (credits to ru): the great thing about this game is that, while it does require micromanagement, it doesn't necessarily need a lot. You can leave the game in order to run an errand if you choose. I've left it for around 10 minutes before - always came back to a 99% operational city (those dead bodies, yo. Keep piling up!)"

655,76.5,Recommended," April 24, 2015",425,"Cities: Skylines is a City Builder/Simulation game, and it’s fantastic.Cities: Skylines absolutely destroys EA and Maxis’ 2013 effort, Sim City, in every conceivable way. Where Maxis managed to somehow fail in a genre they pretty much invented, Colossal Games and Paradox Interactive have treated Maxis’ effort as a treatise on what not to do.This is, without a doubt, the game Sim City 2013 should have been.First up, the graphics. Skylines is very well optimized, with large detailed cities bustling along with no hiccups, and some nice options in the settings to fiddle with if you do experience any problems. The game looks great, with lots of detail. Buildings grow and “level up” as you watch, changing their value and appearance and attracting different types of people and businesses. You can easily identify different areas and specialties, as well as transport, power and sewerage systems by colour using the (mostly) intuitive UI. Clicking on people, houses and buildings will give you more details, and identifying problems (or successes) is made very easy.The gameplay is where Skylines shines, however. You’ll be juggling residents needs and wants by ensuring access to clean water, power, efficient transportation, entertainment and medicine, to name just a few. You’ll have to control pollution, both physical and noise, crime and disease. There are a variety of ways to do this, how you go about it is up to you.You’ll start by placing roads. Then zone areas off the roads into a category: Residential, Industrial, Retail and Office. Then set up a functioning power grid and clean water/waste water sewerage system. After that, it’s all about placing public services to attract more people, and expanding your city across the map. And what a map! You initially start on each map with a 2 square kilometre parcel of land in which to build, but can expand out over 8 such parcels out of 25 available per map. That said, it is trivial to mod out the limitation, and if your computer can handle it, you absolutely can build on the entire map. As a bonus, if you don’t like any of the premade maps the game ships with, you can easily use the in-game map editor to create (or recreate!) your own map to play on. There is even an asset editor too, so you can create and modify the in game assets to your preferences.The game systems make sense, and work how you’d expect them to. This is a simulation game, after all! After you’ve finished zoning your city, you can then create districts, which allow you to apply policies city wide or just to select areas. Make the CBD have compulsory smoke detectors and free public transport, while giving the poor and destitute section of town a rebate on green energy. Ban heavy vehicles from residential areas to lower noise and decongest traffic!Industries will make you money, but require careful planning. Take advantage of natural oil reserves, mine ore, farm, cut down your forests or simply go for “Generic”, where you’ll be making random stuff. The finance and taxation system is easily understood and superb.The game models traffic behaviour very well and in fact figuring out a way to manage high density traffic is one of the hardest aspects of playing Skylines. To that end, you’re given plenty of options, such as numerous road types, public transport, cargo ships, trains and aeroplanes.Surprisingly, the game has an incredibly effective water simulation too; Dams will burst and water flows realistically throughout the map, and pollution will be carried downstream with currents.The icing on the cake for Cities: Skylines is the fact that Skylines is 100% mod friendly, with integrated Steam Workshop support. People have already uploaded thousands of custom maps and assets to the workshop, as well as gameplay tweaks and it’s pretty safe to say that if you find something wrong with the game that you think could be better, there is a very good chance that there is already a mod for it on the workshop.Now you’ve heard me gush over how great this game is, what are the cons?The game doesn’t auto-save! This is a real pain if you mess up. But, there is a mod for that.There is no day/night cycle, which would have been nice. But, there is a mod for that.The camera doesn’t let me go low enough to get a good look of my city streets up close. But, there is a mod for that. There is another one that enables a First Person View from and person you click on in the street!Not a lot of maps to choose to play on. But, the workshop has hundreds available, downloaded and added to the available maps with a single click.There is even a mod that allows you and a friend to explore your cities in First Person online, using the in game people as avatars. Why? Who knows! But it’s possible!In conclusion, if you like city builders or simulation games, you cannot go wrong with Cities: Skylines. It is everything you could want out of this genre.Sim City, eat your heart out."
118,139.5,Recommended," May 11, 2015",464,"This really is the greatest city simulator there is, and will be for quite a long time. I'm having trouble finding ANYthing wrong with this game. I've played most SimCity's, Anno 2070, Cities XL and almost fell for the Cities XXL nonsense. Then I found this game, and my life is complete.Some of the things worth noting:- The UI is simple but intuitive, it doesn't have that featureless feeling some of the plainer UI's have.- The game itself runs incredibly well, however you do need a good processor and a few GB of RAM to play it idealy.- Gameplay is silky smooth and addicting, no glitches or anything. There's even a little in-engine physics to things like cars, rivers and trees.- Road design is incredibly free and grid layouts are 100% accurate, unlike 2013's Simcity.- Full workshop and in-game modding support with an expanding community and many interesting items and maps to choose from, Copper Creek on the workshop is my favorite.- This list just goes on and on...The only thing I can really notice being undesirable (to a small extent, it's not really a big deal) are things like garbage and deathcare. They tend to get overwhelming and lots of weekly money needs to be spent to fix them. (When your landfills are full or more people are dying than you can transport to a cemetary kind of thing) I'd recommend finding something better on the workshop or using the asset editor to lower/raise some gampleay values in those buildings slightly.Just a fair little heads up to newcomers, your citizens in this game are born, age, and die eventually. Don't worry though, they'll be replaced by their children for the largest part. But there may be a point in the game where a lot of people suddenly die and it's a little scary. This is because of your senior citizens getting a little too old. if you know what I mean. Be sure to prepare for this if you find it to happen, I am not completely certtain if it's just that playrhrough of mine of if it's actually a phenomenon within the game. :PTo sum it up and make it nice and short for you, this game really is a worthwhile investment and it honestly, coming from someone who's a dear city-builder fan, steps on all the other titles and I mean ALL of them. You'll love it.Find my review helpful? Have anything to say or any constructive criticism to give? No problem! Let me know!"

1,136.5,Recommended," March 11, 2015",324,"This is a truncated version of this video review:YouTube™ Video: LGR - Cities: Skylines Review Views: 869,911Finally, a promising contender for SimCity's city-building crown. Is it any good? How does it compare to its predecessors? Find out in this review!If you’ve longed for another great city-builder like I have, or simply want to try one for the first time, I don’t hesitate at all in saying Cities Skylines is a superb choice.Skylines is a proper old school city-builder. As a SimCity player since the 1989 original, I was chomping at the bit to get my hands on this thing. I’ve spent about 40 hours on it so far, so the question is: does it succeed in its goal of topping SimCity? Well, in a word, YES.As is tradition, you start with a blank plot of land and a set of tools at your disposal. Generally the goal is to build a city, grow it as big as you like, and make sure it doesn’t die. You have a single highway connection to start out with, which acts as the first of many entrances to your city. Use the road tools to draw some roads, and you’ll see that you get groups of tiles extending from the side of them. These tiles can be filled with three types of zones: residential, commercial, and industrial, which will become homes, shops, and factories. Although more come into play later on, like high-density residential and commercial zones, as well as office zones, the central system of RCI demand is very much in play here. The more demand for a zone you have, the more people will move in to fill those zones and the more service buildings you'll require, so you’ll want to balance their placement with the other needs of the city. Beyond these basics, it’s totally up to you as to what’s next.And thankfully you’re not limited to your initial map size. That starting plot of land is 2 square kilometers, but once you start reaching its borders, you have the option to buy more, up to 36 square miles worth (more if you mod the game with the excellent tile mod on Steam.) Although, sometimes the game gets a bit bogged down in ambiguities regarding its logic, mostly regarding traffic, services, and lack of UI information. But once I started to figure these systems out, the challenge in fixing them was hugely rewarding. Cities XXL and SimCity 5 were entirely too easy, and if you screwed those cities up, that was a real feat of ineptitude. Here, a doomed city can arise from something as simple as building an intersection instead of a multi-lane traffic circle, and that’s kind of awesome. But it doesn't feel cheap, it feels like something to learn from and perform better next time. There are also some included mods from the developers, which act as cheats and difficulty settings in lieu of more traditional menu options. And on top of that there's an incredible potential for user-made mods, with a full blessing from the developer to do so with the included Steam Workshop support.Let me just say it: This is the game I’ve been craving since SimCity 4. My few complaints are just drops in a sea of truly satisfying gameplay. It’s the kind of game that I can play for so many hours at a time that when I leave, I start seeing zone layouts in my ceiling, and traffic patterns in my cereal. Just give me a pot of coffee and watch me while away dozens of hours creating the perfect balance of land value, city services, and mass transit systems and be completely content. It’s blissful, stressful, and compelling on a level that few games ever achieve for me anymore. There are so many details that I love, like the way you can paint zones with different brushes, the sweeping orchestral soundtrack, the guidelines that appear when placing roads, the fact you can flood your city if you dam a river improperly, the way any zone has buildings that fit into any plot shape, and on and on.And it runs great too, even when surpassing 100,000 citizens, it still played solidly with minimal frame rate issues on both my desktop and laptop. Colossal Order pulled off a true colossal order here: they made a better SimCity than Maxis could (requiescat in pace.) And all this with a comparatively small budget, a team of a dozen or so people, and the Unity Engine. Just... wow. Cities Skylines is a total slap in the face to SimCity 5, and man is it a beautiful thing to behold. And the price... you get twice the game at half the price of its rival's launch price. Folks, this is what I like to call “doing it right”. They could’ve charged double and I still would recommend it, but wow. This is a top-notch game at a bargain launch price, and it makes me want to cry tears of joy."
601,8.2,Recommended," December 8, 2017",149,"I'm terrible at city-building games. JUST TERRIBLE. You know the ""city advisor"" features in most games of this type? They are ALWAYS unhappy with me. ""What, are you an idiot?"" they say.Okay, so I'm not a strategic thinker, so I play city-building games like a painter with a brush, or like Tetris without the disappearing blocks. I think zero moves ahead. I can't think ahead. I'm terrible at chess, too. I just like to build things and watch them evolve, and then tear them down again.Why does this matter in a review of Cities: Skylines? It matters because the game lets me play this way and doesn't penalize me. I can ignore city advisors, or the little twitter feed at the top of the page. I can build a sprawling eco-friendly suburbia or a toxic metropolitan nightmare, and it just lets me do it. Some people bemoan the lack of complex city-building features in this game--and it's true they're adding more all the time--but I celebrate that Colossal Order has realized that people like me exist.The game requires absurdly high specs to run smoothly. One day I hope to upgrade my PC so I can dump sewer water into Shady Acres without an inferiority complex to dampen my malevolent glee."

If you don't already like city-builders, this is a great place to start!I personally love city-building games and I can't really believe that many of the things that they acomplished (either totally or partially) were done. The traffic AI has beengreatly improved since release.Pros:- CURVY ROADS- Adustable height of the roads allowing for customized interchanges- Renewable Energy is the main power source that you will use.- Train/Subway/Bus Routs are editable and can be color coordinated.- Cities grow based upon services and leisure and educated near them.- Mods, 74,000+ mods.- Intuituve Menu Layout- Great AI- Base Game is worth the priceCons:- DLC has too little content for too high a price.Yeah that's all the cons.

52,41.8,Recommended," March 14, 2015",1,"So I made my first city, getting it from zero to eight thousand when I finally unlocked dams. At this point I was doing terrible with electricity, because I really didn't want to make many coal plants, so the second I saw Dams unlocked I saved to make one. I found a great spot that could solve my energy needs forever, and placed the dam. As I clicked I knew I made a terrible mistake. I made the dam directly beside the densest part of my Residential District. Water poured over the side of the dam and into the city, drowning my population and creating abandoned buildings. When the water finally calmed down it was in the form of a lake in the center of the city, halfway in residential, halfway in commercial. In an attempt to fix this I started pumping the water out (which actually seems to have worked), but I put the output in a place where it flowed into both of my main water pumps. And while I was only pumping plain water out of my city, the game counted it as waste water. I was feeding my citizens fresh water poop. So while water was killing the center of my city, poop water was killing the rest. The surge of water also managed to destroy my garbage collection, so I got this terrible mix of overflowing rivers, overflowing garbage, and overflowing sickness.All in all an absolutely hilarious experiance.

750,29.6,Recommended," March 10, 2015",622,"Cities Skylines ReviewIts been a long time since a really good City Builder has been on the market so every time there is a whisper of a new one being developed, fans of the genre like myself become eager with anticipation. Unfortunately, we have been left wanting for nearly a decade. Yes, its been that long since a really decent sim has been released. Upon learning that one of my favorite publishers, Paradox Interactive, had a City Building simulation in the works I knew this was a game I could not wait to get my hands on. Paradox Interactive is known for being a leader in challenging and entertaining strategic games so I felt if anybody could do it right, they could. Having been able to test the game for almost a full week before its official release I can say that my trust was not misplaced. Cities Skylines is everything I hoped it would be. This is city building done right.I have played most every City Building game ever made and consider myself somewhat of an expert in the genre. Perhaps I am over-critical at times when it comes to my favorite gaming genre but it comes from the desire to find the Holy Grail in city sims. I can honestly say, Cities Skylines is far and above, the best city building simulation ever made. Period. Colossal Order has come up with a recipe that ingenuously combines just the right amount of simplistic game design with a flavorful amount of challenging gameplay to create a masterpiece. Fans of City Building simulations will definitely not want to miss grabbing this game.There is a very realistic feel to this game. Its not just about throwing out color-coded building zones, but more about true city management. Do things right and your populus will be greatful and steadily grow. Do things poorly and your city will clear out faster than a zombie apocalypse could make it happen. Numerous tools are at your disposal as expected with an interesting dynamic that truly brings the realism into the game. Cities can be carved up into different districts and each district can have its own set of policies and characteristics. Players even choose the names. But it doesn't just stop there. Players can give custom names to just about everything in the game including its citizens.Transportation and pollution will be key challenges as with any game of this type. Having experience with previous endeavors like the Cities in Motion series, Colossal Order has easily found a way to challenge players along these lines. Cars and trains, ships and planes. Cities Skylines has it all. The water simulation is spectacular as well. Placing your sewage disposal upstream, for example, could result in contaminating your citizens' water supply. Realistic flooding is another possible scenario. The maps included are gigantic and beautifully designed terrains that offer endless possibilites when planning your city and continued population growth unlocks the ability to expand to adjacent tiles on the map as well as making more buildings and options available (such as taking out loans). These options are tied in with overall success and not just simply from having enough funds available, a feature which definitely enhances the experience.I could go on and on about all of the things I admire about this game. The graphics are solid but not overly done which allows for most systems to be able to run this game smoothly. The UI is easy to use and understand. The ""Chirper"" social media feature is a clever modern touch that keeps mayors abreast of public opinion and concerns. And, perhaps one of this game's best features is the inclusion of asset and map editting tools to allow the Steam Community to heavily mod this game in order to continue its growth and stability in the future while adding tons of extra content and replay value.In fact, about the only area I found lacking in this game is not having a variety of random events such as natural disasters. I cannot say with certainty why the developers chose not to include them and perhaps they will be added later as DLC since most Paradox Interactive games are known to offer quality additional content long after initial releases. The modding community could possibly offer them as well, since I predict the Steam Workshop will quickly fill up with a large variety of added content. Fires, floods, pollution, infrastructure and transportation issues are still more than enough to keep players challenged and fully engaged though, so overall its not really a major concern.Cities Skylines is the best City Building simulation developed in a long time and quite possibly the best ever. Expect this game to continue to grow in popularity and become the new industry standard for games of this type. An amazing game with well-designed features integrated into it for such a small development team and a limited budget. Its definitely worth the price and I highly recommend this game to all fans of simulated strategy/cty building games."

BUT, like any other game, it has it's downfalls too.MAP SIZE: 10/10The city size is HUGE. At first you start out in a 2kmx2km area, but you can expand to a total of 9 of them, for a 18x18km area or 324 km or 201 mi area. Another pluside is that there are already mods to expand your city size to a total of 25 tiles, for a 50x50 km area, 2500 km, or 1553 mi area. The size of this doesn't make your computer lag, either, unless you don't meet the minimum requirements for the game.AI: 7/10They all have diverse personalities, and you can explore the lives of each of them. The only problem is the traffic. It's terrible: If there all 6 lanes available, they will all go in one lane. Genius.INTERFACE: 9/10The interface is great. It is just a little cluttered.HOW IT RUNS: 10/10It runs extremley smooth and only starts to lag when you have HUGE cities. For an example, watch this video:THINGS TO DO: 9/10There is a LOT to do, from perfecting neighborhoods to fixing water pipes. The only reason I knocked 1 point off is because there are no disasters, which in my opinion is something required for a city building game.DIVERSITY: 9/10The only reason it is 9/10 is because the building colors are almost identical and painted-looking. Despite this, you can model your own buildings :)DIFFICULTY: (not how hard the game is) 9/10The only reason it is difficult is when you get to huge cities it becomes literally difficult with everything in your face all at once.GRAPHICS: (for the average graphics of the time of the release date) 9/10They are amazing. I've seen better, but it is still great. It has it's own style.CLUTTER: 8/10Ugh, when your in a city trying to build, pop ups everywhere makes it hard to work..PRICE: 10/10For this great of a game, it is very cheap at the time of it's release.OVERALL SCORE:90% To PerfectWould I recommend this? Yes!"
273,"1,568.9",Recommended, January 14,333,"Hi. I'm an asset creator for this game, which is to say I make custom Workshop content so people can have something interesting and different to look at in their cities. I am not the best asset creator for this game - but I really love doing it.If Cities:Skylines didn't exist, I wouldn't have bothered to learn how to create 3D game assets and models, texture said models, nor would I have met some fantastic people who share the same interest. I've always loved city builders, all the way back since SimCity on the SNES - and this one really scratches that itch. The enthusiasm and diversity of this community can not be understated. As a Canadian, I've met people from the U.K., Kazakhstan, Russia, France, Japan, the U.S. - and some of my fellow countrymen - and all have shared that enthusiasm. In terms of a competent and accommodating community, Cities:Skylines is hard to beat.As a city builder, it's competent. It is better than the latest SimCity (2013), which is part of the reason why this game did so well. But it's not without its flaws. The thing is, though, like all cult classic games, you won't have a reason to complain about anything until you're deep enough in to call yourself a fan.The base game is worth the price of admission outside of a sale. You should experience it if you have any interest in city builders. As it is a Paradox published title, there is a considerable amount of DLC, which some, sometimes, including myself, find disagreeable. My recommendation here is to purchase the After Dark and Mass Transit DLCs at any cost and go for the Snowfall, Natural Disasters and Green Cities when you can get them at a good price. All DLCs add something worthwhile to the game - but After Dark and Mass Transit, to me, were the most beneficial to gameplay.Also, if you decide to purchase - ensure you have a decent supply of RAM before loading up on custom content. The minimum requirement for the game is 4gb - but I would recommend 8 (16 or more, if you can afford it. It's a Unity thing.).The grassroots nature of Cities:Skylines is its greatest virtue. It's one of those few striking games that really exemplifies 'We, the people.' It is so many things to such a diverse crowd.So, if you're a builder type, and you're hedging on it, you have my recommendation."

1,46.3,Recommended," March 15, 2015",168,"Cities Skylines looks to bring back the classic city building genre to it's roots. Avoiding the mistakes made by EAs most recent Sim City release, Skylines does without an always online connection, supports large building areas and user created mods.And while avoiding these pitfalls, Collosal Order and Paradox have also made a very addictive and entertaining game. You can easily lose hours making sure your bus routes are optimized and your fire departments can get to that shack down the road that keeps burning down.The UI is clear and easy to navigate, building roads and designating zones for construction is simple, yet requires some careful planning if you want to make the ""best"" city possible. There are many tools and overlays available for viewing crime, water quality, power consumption, etc. Economy isn't overtly deep, simple sliders for taxes, and options for different policies. For those wanting to go deeper, you can rename every citizen, vehicle, building, create districts, individually manage them, alter bus routes, and plenty more for the mayor that wants to really get down to street level.Planning traffic routes is of prime importance in this game. Industry needs to move products, emergency services need to get to calls, and dead people need to be removed from their homes. More so than pretty much anything, you need to keep your eye on this. This isn't surprsing given the developer's history with Cities in Motion (despite being a Paradox game with a similiar name, this isn't part of the Cities XL series).Graphics look good for the genre (don't expect GTA V detailed cities), and everything is running smooth for me at a population of 45k as of this writing. The sounds are what you'd expect, nothing really stands out, and it's not annoying, fairly average.While the variety of options in the game is plenty, there are still some things I'm sure some people will miss from other city building games. No day or night cycle kind of spoiled my desire to see my city lit up at night. There could be a bit more variety in buildings, and public services (libraries, museums, prisons, zoos and some other notable buildings all appear to be absent). I'm sure modders will fill in this gap given some time, but I wouldn't mind paying for a hefty expansion if they decided to release more content in the future.PS:Kill Chirpy."

I must admit... it was one of the weakest SimCity games I had played but I still put some time into it because I appreciated that the Maxis team had tried something different.Then SimCity (5) happened... I was one of those suckers that actually went out and bought a hard copy of the game the day it released. Heck I had been waiting for about 10 years and when I spent what is roughly $45 dollars I thought it was worth it because this is SimCity! I played the game for about a week and then went played SimCity 2000 instead. Yes that's right, I would rather play a game made in 1994 than one made in 2013.

347,65.9,Recommended," September 24, 2016",140,"Cities: Skylines is a city building simulator. Build a city from the grounds up, managing the budget and city services for a population that is increasingly demanding as it grows. This review takes into account the After Dark DLC (will update review as I acquire and play with further DLCs).Pros: The game looks great with intricate models and gorgeous night-time lighting effects. The tutorial is built into the game with help cards that explain each game concepts when accessing them for the first time. These concepts are gradually introduced upon reaching certain population thresholds, which makes sense: a 1000-citizen town doesn't need a university or a subway line, so you don't get city approval to build these until the population mendates it. Colossal Order's experience with Cities in Motion shines through the complex, but not complicated, public transport system, down to bus routes, cab depots and international airports. City budget is simple with scroll-bars for taxes and service expense, and various city-wide or district-specific policies ranging from Smoking Ban for a better city health to Legalized Marijuana for bonus tourism. Money is inflated just well enough, as either something's wrong with your city and you're losing a lot of money, or you fixed what's wrong and you're making a lot of money, preventing you from spending an eternity waiting for your money to go up a few dollars at a time (unlike some other city builder I know) or needing to change the game speed in an attempt to skip the wait. Statistics and graph tools are impeccable, you just pick category from the graphs menu or a building from your build menu, and you get stats, capacity, street coverage and building needs right in the city view.: You are limited to a starting map and may gradually purchase more land, and while the concept makes sense in tycoon-style games, you can unlock most land expansions pretty early and their cost is pretty low, so it feels like a cheap way to force you into starting at a particular location when you wish you could start you city elsewhere on the map. There are some weird oversights in the graphics, such as large ships that literally pass through bridges, or trees that grew under water (leaves and all). Building long roads or pipes in a straight line is also sketchy: I regularly had roads built in parallel still have the space between them shrink over distance, or have the hardest time getting both directions of a highway aligned in curves. I mean, I'm all for it when it comes to not being locked into an isometric grid, but it should allow you to build straight when you want to. Ironically, buildings and land tiles, which you may want to customize, actually ARE locked in a grid along the road. Even with a dozen alternate routes, every single car (including emergency vehicules) use the shortest road regardless on traffic jams, a problem that only gets worst as the city grows.: ★★★★★ - Play this. Now.The Cons may appear lengthy, but it's only because these were minor gripes that required explanation to even grasp why they are gripes. is the best city builder out there, bringing everything that was fun about , equaling or surpassing most innovations brought, and adding so much of its own. If you like city simulators at all, this one is a must have. I can't wait to experience the DLC's new weather conditions and city services, as well as the upcoming DLC that'll give it the only things left SimFans can still brag about.—————————————————————————"

A balance between looking good, and performing well. While not top of the line graphics, Skylines found a sweet medium between realism and cartoony that actually works rather well. It's not distracting in any way, and you wouldn't really notice until you zoomed in close to individual cars and people. The city feels alive and bustling, and the game still performs well at large simulation levels. The interface is very, very well thought out, along with each of the overlays.

And dams will alter the flow of the river- Noise pollution is taken into consideration (Can be caused by traffic, windmills, industries etc.).- District zoning (allows you to micro-manage your city easily). Policies can be introduced only to the specific districts. For example, in district 1 it is legal to use recreational drugs while in district 2 it is illegal.- Easily accesable info view where you can see the stats of your city, such as education, crimes, and so on.- Natural resource exploitation for more income.- Detailed public transportation systems which allows you to plan the routes.- Very easy to learn especially if you have played city building games such as Simcity before.- You are able to see the complaints of your citizens in a notification box above the screen which functions like twitter. This allows you to pinpoint and correct problems quickly.- Very big map sizes allows you to build metropolitan cities.- Limited service buildings are available at first but becomes available as your city grows (makes it easy for new players to learn)Cons:- Road mapping can get wonky sometimes and you end up building roads that are slanted. This kinda irritate the OCD side of me.- The unavailability of service buildings early in the game means that it is harder to plan your city early on.

Placed in a vast canvas you have the opportunity to build the city of your vision, but at a cost of demanding civilians wanting every single ounce of their needs met. This is a game challenging you the further you progress.Pros:- Plenty of maps to choose from (even more with the DLC)- Realistic traffic flow, your city suffers if there are to many high traffic zones.- The ability to separate policies per district is a huge plus.- The city's leveling progression is a nice take on how well you're improving and also gifts you with funds.- The building dynamics is easy to learn and also lets you remove the snap to grid feature to build roads however you want.- Plenty of different buildings and community lots to build to assist the happiness of your citizens.Cons:- I'm not a huge fan in the beginning of building a new city you are sort of forced to build off of a highway, I understand people need a port into the city, but if you do want to build off and away from the highway it can become expensive.- Some of the citizens needs become tedious at times, especially during the later stages of a big city. The challenge is great, but at times you just see the little thought bubble and you want to bulldoze that person's house.- Even though I paid for all of the DLC, after thinking about the purchases some of the DLC content should be integrated into the game for free.Despite it all, I love this game.

74,67.9,Recommended," October 29, 2016",141,"I started with city builders way back in 1996, with SimCity 2000, beginning the construction of my ""capital of capitals"" - I was nine, I nerded out, made it a capital of an empire I created for myself, heh. For the permanently angled view, the constant reticulation of splines, and the occasional metal monster blowing up my forests of arcologies and massacring millions of my citizens as a result, there was enough to it to make the imagination to go wild. SC3K (and 3K Unlimited/World Edition) was the same basic idea with a lot more detail, and SC4 allowed me to build bigger and bigger (Rush Hour was a neat touch too, because you could actually into the streets - not quite like Streets of SimCity, but close enough). Even Societies, which gets a bad rap because it's not Maxis - among other reasons - worked out great - perhaps even better, as your decisions on the society effected the decor quite nicely. (I tended to build Authoritarian cities, heh heh.)Then came SimCity 2013, and it seemed like a good idea to start. Except for the constant online feature, the DRM controversies, so on...and the fact that the city sizes were fixed, as opposed to the variously-sized tiles made available in SC4. It basically turned into another typical EA game - ""buy more of this, it will enhance the experience"". I was disappointed...Cities of Tomorrow was an interesting touch, but not enough to keep me going.Then I heard about Cities: Skylines. A number of people suggested the similar-yet-unrelated Cities XL (and various sequels) to me in lieu of SC '13, and when this came out, some pointed me here. I got it during the last sale about a month ago, and began building a new incarnation of my capital of capitals...and for the first time in twenty years, it felt like a real city, with real needs. I was used to the basic stuff, mainstays of most city-builders of this type - needs power, water, garbage disposal, police, so on - but in my first playthrough, I looked in the healthcare tab and went, ""Wait...cemeteries? You have DEATHCARE in this game?"" Which was kinda funny to me, as in real life, I like to explore historic cemeteries...the thought never occurred to me that maybe there could be historical cemeteries in my own cities!The unique buildings and monuments are also a nice touch, because they're functional as well as decorative (I have them all except for the fusion plant, I need the observatory). The weather is also nice; I will have to get the Snowfall pack to see how well I can build in the snow...if it's anything like New England winter, probably not too well!While there is still a size limit (barring the use of mods) for your city, it's a lot larger than in SC '13, and also has a lot more flexibility than SC '13...or any other type of game like this I've played, for that matter. And the realistic details allowed me to fool my friends and family; my brother had actually thought a screencap of my city was a photograph of a real city.In short: Loads of fun, and it's induced me to commit heresy against the Church of SimCity by building here...any fans of the golden oldies, please don't burn me at the stake."

(Simcity 2013's upgrade roads had an idea going but you had to level an entire street to get anywhere, completely negating the point)-Being able to relocate a civil building for much cheaper than destroying removes the hassle of trying to redo roads around a public service due to a single building.-Still has well-working fluid and sewage dynamics, taking what SimCity 5 attempted with their pollution system and actually turning it into something good.-Parks affect the lives of citizens without taking ungodly amounts of space, and much like a real park one large park that is easily accessible more than a few hundred small parks all around the city wasting space.

159,454.9,Recommended," October 29, 2016",89,"To honor this great game I deleted my old review and spend some time writing a new one.You should know that this game is a long-term investment. You have to spend a lot of time on it fine tuning but in exchange you'll get back a lot of excitement and room for creativity. You can start playing this game with no knowledge about city builder games but you will soon notice that the larger you city gets the more challenging the road network becomes.Although you need a bit of patient or else you won't like the game as much. You will have to bulldoze and rebuild streets sometimes multiple times. Just don't see it as negative point and don't get frustrated. Similar as if you draw a picture.Since this is a city builder you will spend most of your time designing road layouts and managing traffic.No one likes too much talking so here in short the positive and negative points.Right now I have 280 mods installed. The game doesn't crash on my system regularly As always I recommend to save often with that many mods.PS: On the workshop there are 96.363 mods atm. Skyrim has 49,910 on Nexus mods. ;)"
1,26.3,Recommended, February 6,70,"I wasn’t sure what to expect when I booted Cities: Skylines. After Cities in Motion, games that focused on mass transit as their first two games, I was almost definite I was going to have a bad time as I disliked both of those games on some level.A couple hours later I was a bit surprised because the hours flew by. I’ve heard Cities: Skylines is a SimCity clone. In reality, it’s a fantastic Simcity, far better than EA’s always online SimCity that they produced. In fact, it’s released two years after the SimCity release and just is better in every way possible. No online, great gameplay, and not as many really annoying bugs (such as traffic).That’s the thing though, Cities Skylines is SimCity, if you hate the idea of city building, you’re probably not going to be happy here. If you miss classic SimCity, this is a must own. It’s not the same game, but it’s an excellent replacement for it, far superior in almost every way.The big thing in Cities Skylines is the growth of the city ties to items. When your city is a village, you can only create certain objects. Garbage is locked until you 440 people, The Police department is unlocked at 850 people. Want a Solar Power Plant to be green? Get 18,000 people and not a second before that. It actually is a great way to scope the game and let you focus on tasks right in front of you than give you infinite choices and have you build stuff you don’t need but it can limit the game in the early game. This might not be for everyone though.Which is why there are mods, glorious mods! The game ships with three mods if I remember correctly (I’ve gotten a lot since then), the Unlimited money mod, the unlock all mod, and the hard mode mod. The unlimited money and unlock all mods both will unlock all buildings. But there’s a LOT of mods for this game and a ton of great support through mods. Basically, if you don’t like something in Cities Skylines there is a mod for it.But the building system does have one thing that’s quite cool. There are unique buildings in which the player has to fulfill some minor or major task such as construct a certain type of building 30 times, or produce a certain amount of goods. If you do that, you get a special building to customize your city with and give your city bonus usually a tourism, but they also help you build the big monuments which are awesome to aim for.So it’s like a great version of SimCity, what’s different?Well, first there’s a number of tools that aren’t as good as others. The road tool seems to hate perfect lines. I want to draw perfect grids such as can be found in New York City. Just long lines of perfect roads. The road tool seems to hate me and I seem to fail at this often. The roads do snap to each other at specific points, but I seem to miss the 90 degrees by a few degrees often. I’m sure there’s some button to make these roads perfect but it should be easy to do this.I’ve tried to do highways and such and it’s sometimes a bit hard to make the connecting road matchup without an odd design. They’re just something not 100 percent right with the way it creates roads, not to mention curves.The reason you want perfect roads is that the grid for the city has little squares, and anything other than a perfect rectangle gives you spaces in the grid or little gaps that don’t look too bad, but can limit growth They are minor breaks but they don’t look that good and the best buildings won’t be built there.Zoning is well done though and it’s easy to throw down different types of building quickly, and replacing buildings with services don’t seem to hurt the neighborhoods much (The area around the service buildings, like a police station, recovers exceedingly fast.)The game does add a fantastic tool that lets you build districts. But what’s brilliant here, is you can paint the district, applying almost a blob to an area so you can make your own design and rename your districts what you want. You can also change policies specifically for that area if you want. It’s great to grow as you decide. The management of these districts is far easier than I expected, but I’m not a micromanager. I like to run “Freelandia!” where you can do what you want. However the micromanagement with the districts is fun, and it makes your city look great. I love naming areas with different names or recreating real places I have visited in San Diego, LA, Orlando, or of course Boston. Or just name everything after body parts. The choice is yours.I’ve always loved city building, and the experience of just watching a city grow, and that exact experience is here. It takes some time but eventually the player gets an idea how to figure out what’s going on or what problems to tackle. Sadly the game doesn’t have the best complaint system unless you look at buildings. Anything wrong and there’s a little complaint on top of a house. There’s a twitter style feed on the top of the screen that tells you random things going on in your little corner of the world, but it doesn’t give a deep understanding of what’s going on. Imagine if a mayor of a town could only find out what’s going on with a twitter feed. It’s a little silly, the single interactions with the populace doesn’t work. I'd have preferred an advisor telling me what are the major issues people are talking about.In addition, the game is VERY slow. A single day is 10 seconds… at that rate you pass a year in an hour of constant running. That’s a bit long in my opinion. But triple speed makes a day only … 5 seconds! Wait what? Yeah.. triple speed only doubles the time in my test. That means a year is 30 minutes. That’s quite slow still. I’m sure it’s due to the simulation time and such, but really, quite slow. The game is focused on weekly cycles instead of monthlies but it’s a very long year.The one thing I’m not a fan of here is that the game currently promotes its expansions and there’s a lot. It’s starting to become like the Sims, where there’s tons of content each one in its own expansion. Luckily the game doesn’t feel like you need expansions as the main game is fantastic on its own and fully featured, but if you have to have it all. In fact, there’s good quality of life additions to the game along with the expansions. However, it feels that expansions are a bit of a mixed blessing. You can remove DLC from Steam by uninstalling the DLC itself but in game, if they are installed they are always on. Want to switch from a Snowfall game to a one without? You need to uninstall the DLC.Yet the player can avoid all the DLC and the game is still fantastic, it’s a fully featured game with a lot of depth. The ability to grow your city and then tackle new problems is rather refreshing as you can focus your talents on the smaller tasks even on a second playthrough. Designing your city is easier when you’re able to focus on it at first. You can fly through the ranks quickly especially once you know what you’re doing.There’s a very solid UI as well once you learn it, and interesting challenges for the player to tackle. There’s not much here I dislike. Even the annoyances are minor in comparison. I plop down a few zones and I start remembering why I love this game. It’s not just that it reminds me of a great game. It’s a great game on its own. While I didn’t like Cities in Motion much, this is exactly the game I was hoping they would make, and now that it’s here. It is kind of fantastic.So I recommend the heck out of this game. It’s exactly what I wanted, and it’s a genre that hasn’t had a hit like this in a long time. Now with the closure of Maxis, I doubt we’ll ever see a true SimCity to rival the classics, but Cities Skyline is there for us, and it is what we deserve.If you enjoyed this review or want to see my opinion on other games you can find my curator page at this link.

17,130.2,Recommended," March 10, 2015",275,"Hi guys! This is Pablo, from SimNation.Cities: Skylines goes back to the core City Builder experience of SimCity 2000, 3000, 4... and improves on it.Simulation is epic. Each citizen is simulated, with own age, workplace, home, household, education level and happines. They can even own cars. And all of this is persistent. All of them are living in your city until the day they die out of sickness or when their time comes.Traffic and Public transportation is properly executed as well. Heck, even water is simulated with the Fluid simulation. I think we all have seen the dams and the poop flowing by a river at the expected speed and direction.The economic system is awesome. RCI is meaningful. Commerces import goods from the exterior, or local industries if available. Citizens must purchase different kind of goods to be happy. And all of this is executed, and you can get down to street level and see it for yourself.Building a city on Cities: Skylines is this long, epic journey, where you will be laying out the city infrastructure through proper city planning and engineering (the game will punish you for not making road access or dispose your sewage properly), dealing with Noise Pollution, dead body collection, and all with the right level of micro management to make you feel you are in charge. From laying down the routes of buses or metros, to defining Districts and setting unique Policies to change the way it behaves, or help a sector get back on it's feet by lowering taxes or making public transportation free.Despite the lack of polishing of many aspects of the game, from user feedback, to user interface and lack of content variety (chirps, buildings, billboards), you are not going to focus too hard on it because of all the other things the game gets right.If you like city builders, this is hands down a safe purchase. A game that will most likely be supported for years, with an insanely amount of Mods and great deal of free patches to come, which will hopefully fix those rough edges from day 1."

13,"1,884.2",Recommended," November 1, 2016",113,"Do you like creation, or city building? If yes to either, give this game a long look. The two primary ways (soon to be three with the release of scenarios as part of the free update for the Disasters DLC) you'll probably play this game will be either sandboxing with infinite money, or more vanilla which won't use mods.What I love:Scale - The maps are massive. Even in vanilla in which you have access to 9 tiles out of a possible 81, you have a massive space to develop, decorate and grow. As a point of reference, Sim City 2013 maximum city space is equal to 1 square in Cities: Skylines. As a bonus, there are thousands of player created maps in the steam workshop, some of which provide fantastic settings to grow an empire or a small rural city.Living Cities - The people and the traffic all have a life, a destination; they're not simply arbitrary numbers detailing their supposed existence. You will be tasked to provide the infrastructure they need to live and will be critical to succeed as mayor, civil engineer, and accountant of your city.Cities: Traffic Wars - Some love it, some hate it. I love traffic wars. I love the problem solving, the beautification designing of interchanges; it's a very rewarding feeling when you solve traffic problems successfully. Nothing wrong with that. Yes, there is quirky behavior, but it doesn't detract massively from the experience. I have a couple tips: Leave space for traffic to filter and minimize weaving. That goes a long way. There are player guides that tackle how to solve typical traffic issues such as How to Traffic and even guides that look at traffic flow theory and how it applies to this game.Workshop - Mod support and a massive amount of player content means there are enormous number of ways to build a city. Mods provide powerful options to take control, and build with massive freedom. Download responsibly and there will be minimal issues. You aren't limited to zoning and plopping, you can create beautiful, planned cities. The only limitation is your imagination.Not so great:DLC - A bit pricey for what you get, excluding After Dark. That dlc is excluded, and I would definitely take no issue paying full price on. Very feature rich. Unfortunately, the same level of praise is not really warranted for Snowfall. Trams and snow maps are nice, but I would not buy it full price.Vanilla gameplay - As a first time experience to get achievements, it's fine in its own right, but in comparison to what you can do with the player content regarding the mods (you can use building assets, props, etc. in vanilla), the gameplay is limited and quality of life for the player tends to be lower with the lack of performance mods.Difficulty - This is a double edged sword. Lack of difficulty is beneficial to those that simply want to build, grow and show off their skills with infrastructure building, and city painting. This is a negative for anyone that wants a challenging economy in vanilla. This will hold particularly true if you like that kind of gameplay in Simcity. Fortunately, for the challenge inclined, you can make it much harder on yourself with mods, and Scenarios are coming out soon, which will provide win and lose condition scenarios as part of the Disasters dlc. It will be free.TLDR: Love building, traffic wars, the almost endless beautification options, and I can be a major creep as I roleplay God with my topdown world view as I stalk a handsome young man coming home from work as he goes home to sleep at night (he actually does live in that house). Glorious. Would I recommend to anyone that remotely likes city builders? Absolutely."

With very little bugs and massive modding support, this game is the best of the best.Cities After Dark has made it so much better, with activity in your city slowing down (which in turn makes your economy slow down at night, adding a new challenge to the game), as night progresses. Some parts in your districts can be set to accomidate night life to make even more money to compensate for the lost revenue. Taxi services, train lines, bus lines, and subways are options for public transportation. Water and electricity management are vital to survive as a municipality. I love Cities: Skylines!"

I'm trying to think of a downside besides the fact the there's not a Gold Edition [Edit 2/2017] YES THERE IS YEAH --out that bundles all of the expansions into a single game.--Build a city and manage traffic from the ground up, master the joy of constructing blocks, roads, interchanges, you name it.

But I can assure you, you can stop reading reviews for this game and buy it right now (or as soon as you can). Simply put, this is the best city-builder released for more than 12 years, since SimCity 4. Half the price as SimCity 2013 but with many more features, this game is easily worth the $30 price tag. Perhaps even buy the deluxe edition for the extra $10; the developers deserve it (the game was made by a team of about ten people).So stop reading this review and buy the game.For those still unsure about their purchase of this game, I'll now list some of my favorite parts, many of which SimCity 2013 and other city-builders lacked.Hopefully that small list of a few of my favorite things has convinced you to buy the game. Cities: Skylines will undoubtedly reshape the city-building genre, and will continue to do so for years to come, as the devs have promised extended support to as much as ten years.UPDATED Sept 24th, 2015:For the DLC haters out there, this game will have plenty of DLC during it's long run. However, they'll be cheap (the one just released, After Dark, is only15 USD) and add actually new things that matter. Releasing along side every DLC is a patch that adds plenty of new features for people who don't buy the DLC (in the case of After Dark, non-DLC people will still get the day-night cycle among other things for free)."

Here are some pros and cons of the game.PROS:-Beautiful Graphics-Good concept-Has amazing workshop Mods-Thrill of being able to tax other people (my favorite!)-Easy to learn about-Provides a challenge (in some ways)-Great for players looking for something to do-The new Natural Disasters are amazing-The new DLC Natural disasters lets you bust criminals from a helicopterThese are just some of the pros this game providesCONSEvery game has a downside to it. Here are a few you might want to think about before buying-Some of the in-game challenges such as death care and traffic can be hard to solve, but can be resolved with experience and (LOTS) of patience-Id say a good computer is needed to play this game without lag. This game is playable with lag, but will slightly impact your enjoyment of the game.Overall, Cities: Skylines is a great game.

Cities: Skylines went back to the simulators that were fun, pulled the best parts of them, and upgraded them to today's standards. It's fun without being overly punishing but still provides a challenge for those of us who want it. Sure it isn't perfect, but there are few games that even scratch that lofty goal.Probably the biggest issue is the lifespan of the citizens. All citizens lead a perfect and full life. This means if you have 2000 people move into your city all at once, they all die at the same time. It's really frustrating until you realize what's happening at the simulation. But there's a mod that changes that, giving citizens variable length lives.But that's the only problem with this game. There can be some other gripes made about performance of 100k+ cities and traffic management nightmares, but I've never met a modern simulator that doesn't have those issues. Simply put, if you want a city simulator that's worth the money, you can't go wrong with Cities: Skylines."

The game is addictive and provides hours of fun. I am 15 hours in and I only have 50,000 people in my city with so much more land available to grow.

You will build cities that will seem amazing in the beginning, but will soon turn out to be utter disasters when it comes to traffic and such. After some time, though, you will get better and better at building cities, and this is when the real fun starts.The only really negative thing I have to say about Cities Skylines, is that the DLC's are seriously overpriced.

3,17.1,Recommended," August 17, 2016",138,"Cities: SkylinesDeveloper: Colossal Order LTDPublisher: Paradox InteractiveIntroduction==========I've never been particularly great at city building games, though I have been sort of playing them since the old Sim City 2000. Actually in that one I spent more time loading up scenarios and dropping various disasters on the city than playing...but still. There were very few offerings in this genre apart from Sim City, but then Cities: Skylines happened, and suddenly Sim City wasn't top dog anymore. Some will argue that Cities is better in every way.Gameplay==========As city builders go, Cities: Skylines is pretty simple. New players might be a little confused in the beginning, just as I was. I was so used to the Sim City UI and flow. First you need to setup roads, then zone the areas beside them. Residential, Commercial, Industrial, etc. Hook up power, water, and sewage, then watch as buildings start to pop up and people start to move in. As your population rises, new features, monuments, and buildings become available. There are tons of options for setting up your city, such as different kinds of roads, buildings leveling up, the ability to rename literally everything, and terrain redesign. As long as the basic needs are met, your city can thrive, but obviously some configurations and setups are better than others. How efficently things run is entirely up to you and how you plan out your city.You can freely manipulate the passage of time, by pausing it or speeding it up by 3 different levels. There is a nice option to have unlimited funds if you don't feel like being constrained by anything or just want to test out different layouts on a different save. Planning is probably the most important step of setting up a city, and finances is part of that. If you aren't particularly great at finances, the unlimited money option will be your best friend. It's recommended to pause the game right away when you first get started and make sure you go through the in-game tutorial prompts.Oh, one little tiny extra detail that may make or break your purchase decision: STEAM WORKSHOP SUPPORT. MODS. Enough said!==========This game is absolutely gorgeous. Every tiny detail is amazing. Once you get your city setup, zoom in and check it out from time to time, especially when you get some skyscrapers or monuments set up, or at night during the hustle and bustle. This game will provide you with some amazing screenshots for your Steam profile showcase! Pure eye candy all around.==========Cities: Skylines has a very relaxing soundtrack. Perfect for long or short sessions. When zoomed in enough, you'll also hear your citizens as they go about their daily lives. Car horns honk during busy traffic times, and of course there's the bustle of the industrial zones. Nothing was left out here. It's completely possible to get pretty immersed into your city, in every aspect.==========The game runs wonderfully, I didn't experience a single problem even on the highest settings. Stable framerates, no lag, no stuttering. Mouse control is highly recommended. I'm not even sure a controller works, I didn't try. Might do it next time I play and update this, just for those who enjoy controller supported games.==========What a wonderful game! Whether you enjoy city builders already or are looking to get into them, Cities: Skylines is a great title to introduce you to the genre or keep veterans occupied. With a couple of DLCs available, and of course all the mods currently out, you'll have plenty to keep you busy managing your city for dozens or even hundreds of hours. A great buy for sure.==========:=========="

727,35.5,Recommended," June 6, 2015",51,"Cities: Skylines is a city builder game of your dreams. You can design almost every detail including appearance of buildings, parks and other stuff, but it is only for the most fanatic players. General player population (Inc. Myself) will get with projecting town streets where the game also gives you a huge opportunity to be creative by designing every angle, every corner of the streets and planning where will be commercial, residential and industrial zones as we know it from the old Simcity franchise. You have to care about your citizens to make city prosperous, build hospitals, police offices, fire stations, cemeteries, public transport systems, roads etc. and enable easy access to these facilities. If you do it right there won't be problems with traffic jams and that's the biggest obstacle not only in every simulator of this type, but also in real life.So the Cities: Skylines has everything it should, but it also has another assets to offer: unlocking buildings like Hadron Collider or Fusion power plant and many more can get your attention and believe me achieving those is a long way. One of the most interesting things are districts and policies. You can divide your city into smaller districts applying another policies in different parts. For example you can lower taxes in newly developing areas to grab attection of investors or ban smoking and demand smoke detectors in industrial areas to prevent them from fire threat and many more. I really appreciated land value index by which you can deduce how different city parts are doing.The game can entertrain you for hours and it's really fun, but there are some imperfections I have to criticize. The most significant is once you get from the first struggles of a newly developing town, after making the first profits the game seems to me too easy, I'd appreciate some random events, all i care after that is traffic and that's what can be really annoying after a while."

Warm colors.Game is easy to start and if you don't mess up completely in the beginning getting your city up and running shouldn't be an issue. Has hard mode where things are more expensive and you can also start with unlimited money if you just want to build.Big area where you can spread out your fledgling little town and thanks to mod support you can have even more space where to build.You can also make your own assets or download ready ones from Workshop and plenty of different mods are available too. From traffic management to automatically bulldozing abandoned and burned buildings.Dealing with the traffic can be a pain in the posterior sometimes in this game and you should be prepared to deal with it. Enough jams and nothing works. Fire engines get stuck in traffic and fires start burning your place down.There is no disaster system in game currently if that's something you miss and need from Sim City titles.Game runs okay, with larger cities it might start slowing down a bit. Every citizen is simulated where they are coming and going and it takes it toll when you have large enough population.If you're planning on unlocking all the buildable area with mods and your computer isn't quite up to date it's something to keep in mind.There are occasional bugs here and there like ships roaming the country side if you do certain things and traffic not using all the available lanes on a road.Doesn't have always online requirement but you can't build multiple cities and have them work together either."

Doing this gives me insight into how I can make my city a better place for that citizen to live in...whether it's improving the transit system, putting in some commercial zones closer to their house, etc. Being able to see real citizens going about their day to day tasks from cradle to grave is amazing.I bought this game based on the early positive reviews I read, and I have nothing but praise to add to them.

The maps are huge and could easily take you weeks to fill out with a single city. It's a far cry from the tiny 'districts' from the latest Simcity. The mechanics, such as placing buildings and infrastructure, are intuitive and easy to use for the most part (the transit lines could use a bit of work), and rarely did I have to wonder ""why can't I place this here"" or ""why isn't this working?"". The amount of in-game content for your city is also quite robust, and the ability to download additional content via the workshop lets you add even more.This is a rock solid city builder that any fan of city sims or simulation games in general needs to own.9/10"

It's a game that feels like it is pushing the citybuilding game genre back to it's roots. Clearly the developers learned from the mistakes of Maxis and EA with SimCity; everywhere it failed to deliver, this game has got it. With a focus on things like Steam Workshop and modding it seems a thriving community will come of this game and clearly hasn't been made to become a DLC machine.YouTube™ Video: Cities Skylines - First Look - Gameplay Views: 4,616Cities Skylines is a city builder game, that shows SimCity how a city building game SHOULD look! This First Look shows many details of Gameplay, including even things like mods!Pros:> Wide audience appeal. It feels that it can be as casual or as serious as you want it to be. Not at all daunting for a first timer to use, and even includes things like hard mode for the more seasoned city builder.> The game feels very well optimised and runs very nicely. Both my laptop and desktop PC play this game very well.> Easy to use world and assets editors for deeper customisation. Asset creations such as parks, buildings, intersections, props and even trees. All uploadable and retrievable through Steam Workshop.> It has a very detailed simulation of city life. Features things like dynamic water that makes dams usable, or gives you the ability to poison the city water supply with poorly placed pumping stations and drain pipes. You can follow people, cars, buses etc and you can see these people are living out daily lives. The city does feel alive.> Huge expandable worlds to build in. No more cities the size of a village like on SimCity. You can actually build massive sized cities!> You also have freely controllable taxes, funding and policies not only at a city level but also at a district level that can change the feel and dynamic of the cities and the people that live in them. You have a twitter-esque system that gives reports on how people are feeling based on tweets they make about the city.> There's lots to do with the roads. Many different shapes and sizes, one-way systems, highways, dirt roads, pavements etc, and they can all be raised, curved or done freeform.Cons:> No day or night cycle! It seems so many situations on the roadways (rush hours etc) can't be experienced, which makes the traffic feel a bit basic a lot of the time.> Whilst there is a lot to do with the roads, it's not always as accurate as I would like. It makes building more complex road systems a bit of a pain, and won't let you connect up roads and paths in a way you may want. I hope it gets an update soon to let us customise our roads even better.> I notice a lot of the same buildings appearing next to each other, like having a street with just the same burger bar a few times on it. More building variation and randomisation would be nice, but I imagine this could be solved with user-created content.> Some of the figures feel a bit off. The population figures always feel a bit low compared to what you may expect from the current state of your city.Overall it's a lovely feeling game and comparatively to other city builders to come out in recent years, this is definitely the pick of the bunch. It's well priced on launch compared to competitors, especially SimCity."

No need to call it a spiritual successor or anything, this game apes Sim City in every way as far as I can tell. I recall faint memories of attempting to play Sim City 2000 back when I was a little kid but the interface and gameplay was far too complex for me. I had more fun loading up the pre-set savegames of a sprawling metropolis and destroying it with robots or aliens and whatnot. I don't even really have any experience with any city simulators. However, this game does a modern Sim City better than any other game has done in recent memory.I don't have much experience with any city simulators. Now, I'm certifiably addicted to this game. The interface is stellar, the music charming. The sound effects are invigorating. The little dings as buildings level up fill my heart with happiness. The way your tiny ant-like populace pours out of your metro system after arrival is satisfying, as you know they're not using congestion-inducing personal vehicles. The ability to ""paint"" different zones, whether residential, commerical, or industrial is so delightful it's difficult to describe.

No need to call it a spiritual successor or anything, this game apes Sim City in every way as far as I can tell. I recall faint memories of attempting to play Sim City 2000 back when I was a little kid but the interface and gameplay was far too complex for me. I had more fun loading up the pre-set savegames of a sprawling metropolis and destroying it with robots or aliens and whatnot. I don't even really have any experience with any city simulators. However, this game does a modern Sim City better than any other game has done in recent memory.I don't have much experience with any city simulators. Now, I'm certifiably addicted to this game. The interface is stellar, the music charming. The sound effects are invigorating. The little dings as buildings level up fill my heart with happiness. The way your tiny ant-like populace pours out of your metro system after arrival is satisfying, as you know they're not using congestion-inducing personal vehicles. The ability to ""paint"" different zones, whether residential, commerical, or industrial is so delightful it's difficult to describe.

You won't regret it.This game has two sides.Out of the box it is a fun, but somewhat repetitive after 100 hours, city simulation game. It'll still take up months of your time, but eventually all your cities will look the same.The mods is where the game truly becomes a masterpiece. Once you get the right mods, it truly becomes a giant sandbox. You'll be able to do everything from combine buildings to creating parks to the tiniest details, to combining thousands of props to create your own buildings from scratch right inside the game. Take a stroll around the city, hop on a bus... You can dream it, you can probably do it.Pro's:- Various play styles. The developers included mods to enable Sandbox mode and Hard Mode, so you can choose how you wish to play. Want to play without money first, then turn money back on? Sure, just turn off the Unlimited Money mod!- MODS. No, seriously, the mods make this game what it is. Between Move It, Plop The Growables, RICO, More Beautification, Anarchy mods and TMPE, this becomes a completely different game. You can do pretty much anything.- Assets. The workshop is full of extraordinary assets, and it grows larger every day.- The community is amazing.Con's:- The game is build on the Unity Engine. This engine was not meant for simulation games, especially of this size. It doesn't support lazy loading, meaning all 81 tiles are all loaded and rendered at all time, and all assets (vanilla and custom) are loaded into the RAM for the entire duration of the game, whether you use them or not. As such you'll need a decent amount of RAM and a decent CPU to run the game.- Traffic takes some thinking. Cims are abysmal drivers, and so just slapping down a few roads is not enough. You'll have to start learning a bit about how traffic works. There are Traffic AI mods that improve things, but they are quite CPU heavy.Yes if:- You're looking for a sandbox city builder where you can build whatever city you like. Grab a few mods and it becomes a virtual sandbox for you to play around in.- You want a sequel to SimCity 4.No if:- You're looking for an in-depth socio-economic, demographic city management game. There is no political system.- You own a system with an IntelHD GPU. Just don't, it clearly says it's incompatible. Stop complaining the game doesn't work."
1,61.8,Recommended," February 26, 2016",61,"Best city building game out thereI can‘t really tell for how long i have waited for game like this. I always wanted to build a big city, manage it and what is most important feel that the city is alive. And this game delivers.As in every game you start with nothing. You start building roads and zoning and people starting to move in. They require electricity, water and other services. After you provide people with everything they need the buildings start to level up and grow. Step by step your little city becomes more beautiful with every year. After a while your city is full of skyscrapers and is busy 24/7. With the „After dark“ update you got the night/day cycles and it looks amazing. You just look at your city every night, it‘s so beautiful. Also you as a mayor can manage your city. Apply various policies to districts, like ban smoking, encourage biking or ban heavy traffic just to name a few. You can set the taxes for your residents and business and set the budgets of city services like garbage collection, electricity, water, public transport and a few dozen more.People in this game are not just pixels moving in random directions. Every person has a name, home and a job. He goes from his home to a job to a commercial district and back home. Every resident is simulated individually. Similar to Tropico series, but Cities skylines has much more to simulate.Of course like every game this one is no exception and has some flaws.The traffic is the most annoying. You will spend a lot of time managing the traffic, building and rebuilding roads. The previous game these developers have done is called Cities in motion and we can see it influenced Cities skylines, because required attention to traffic is a little too much. AI cars are stupid and don‘t know how to use lanes thus causing congestions. Of course every city has congestion problems and stupid drivers exists in real life too. So maybe it‘s not that bad, but anyway it could be better. Some mods can improve the traffic, but they don‘t change much.The game lacks in management aspect. Yes you can manage your city but it lacks depth. It is too simple. I would like to have poor districts with bad education levels, where crime rate is high and police officers get shot often and you could apply some stricter policies over there or just leave them be in anarchy.Graphics in Cities skylines can be very beautiful, especially at night. Sometimes colors are off a bit, but all in all the game looks amazing. But this comes with a price. I get 25-30fps with GTX970 wich is not acceptable, but because it‘s not an action game i can live with that. I could lower some settings but i want my city look good, it‘s not an action game so it‘s playable at 30fps.Developers support modding very much, the game has steam workshop full of mods. I doubt anyone is playing this game without mods. You can download cars, planes, trains, buildings etc. to beautify and diversify your city. Also there‘s color corrections, some gameplay improvement mods and many more.If you like city building and management games this is a must have. And considering the price it‘s worth it even without a sale, you‘ll get hours of playtime from it. Do not expect much on economic side, but all the city building is done almost perfectly."

There are freebees still being added to the game to this day. Little things that you would normally have to purchase in a DLC are given to us. Support from the studio is amazing. The gameplay is amazing. The ability to mod is amazing. The workshop content is amazing.If I had one complaint, it would lane management for traffic. This has been worked on though and is already better than it was just a couple months ago. With that being said, traffic stops being as much of an issue once you understand the mass transit options within the game.Buy the game. It is worth every penny."

791,26.4,Recommended," September 1, 2016",42,"Cities: Skylines feels like a proper successor to the classic SimCity games. If you grew up on classics like SimCity, SimCity 2000, and SimCity 4, you'll probably feel at home here.For those not familiar, in this genre you build a city by zoning out commecial, residential, and industrial areas as well as the necessary infrastructure (roads, water, power) and an increasing number of other public goods such as police protection, fire protection, education, etc. You set tax rates which impact the economy, and try to stay in the black and allow your city to continue to grow. It's an addictive experience of constant expansion, with another thing you want to build or problem you want to fix always on the horizon and keeping the real-time game version of ""one more turn"" on your lips.As with most of these games, one of the things you'll spend the most time on besides simply laying out more roads and then laying down zones and support buildings is traffic management, and at this Skylines shines. The road construction system offers you a wide variety of to configure your roads with different sizes, one-way-vs-two-way, overpasses, etc, and the traffic flow responds to what you build in sensible and complicated ways. It's a compelling component of the game that can consume hours of your life. Additional options such as foot paths, bus routes, trains, and subways can also lighten the car traffic in your city.Skylines also features an intersting ""neighborhood"" system where you can subdivide your city into different sections and set different city ordinances or economic focuses for each one. While I don't feel that the mechanics of this have as much impact as I might like, just being able to district your city into distinct neighborhoods with their own names helps bring your city into focus and give it more character and specificity.(the Nightlife expansion also adds to this system, but most of my playtime was done before that came out so I'm not reviewing the expansion content, here)Things I don't lke about the game?Primarily, it feels too easy. Even from the start I virtually never drifted into the red, although I would occasionally stall out and need to make some tweaks to keep growing. This seems like it'd be something that is mod-able, but better difficulty options for veterans of the genre who want a challenge would be nice.Additionally, as your city develops it seems that older industrial neighborhoods will occassionally suffer mass unemployment for no apparent reason. The economic specializations you can assign to neighborhoods, in particular, suffer from this doubly and feel like a very short road to a dead end.The industrial collapse itself is a good thing- an interesting challenge to tackle in a game that generally lets you just keep expanding with ease- but the feedback as to why it happens is poor. For example, faced with the situation I'd frequently click on the buildings and see that they had no workers. Thinking that I'd simply educated my populace out of wanting those jobs, I'd try building a school-free slum neighborhood nearby to see if that brought the businesses back, but the businesses remained without workers for no apparent reason.Also, the in-game twitter-alike is inane and way too chatty, but this is a minor quibble.Other than these complaints, I could list a score of minor to moderate UI annoyances- the inevitable consequence of playing a bunch of a game- but the only one that really sits heavily in my mind is the dread I'd feel whenever I made significant changes to my subway system. It's not always clear what happens to existing routes when you make changes and getting a big-picture view of what all of your current routes look like in aggregate can be difficult; a cleaner and color-coded subway route map view would be nice.All in all, I'd heartily recommend Cities: Skylines as an enjoyable sandbox that can easily consume dozens of hours of your life."

I'll put it this way, it's hard to make a bad city and it's hard to make a city that runs at 100% efficiency. Your first couple attempts at building a city are probably going to be in the middle in terms of greatness, but you'll get the basics down as you experiment.The city menus take a little while to get used to, but this is a very good game.

327,10.7,Recommended," June 27, 2017",214,"Okay, I don't usualy write reviews, but I chose to (this time).I love this game. It's one of the best city builders I have played within the past decade. The other one is Cities XL, which I played heavily before Cities Skylies came out (unfortunately that game, Cities XL, is outdated and just wearing; not good for long play).This game, however, if lively, bright, inviting, smooth, and fun.I know a lot of people have an issue with Paradox's ""DLC policy"" but you're not required to buy DLC to enjoy this game. The game itself is fun and has updates on its own. Also, the game is open to mods, which means you can add assets and other things created by other fans of the game from the workshop without having to worry about the DLC....and I wonder jsut how many people may argue about the DLC may have bought an expansion pack for an online game (WoW or any other,... Final Fantasy 14 in my case). I can't knock these worked on mini-expansions small prices when I spend $50 on an expansion for an online game that allows me to use 3 new jobs and travel to a new area...even thought I will be right next to people who can access these things without me having them (meaning the $50 was just a glorified unlock code, essentially)I mean they could wait and make a massive expansion and release a fullsized expansion but I don't see the issue with sevelal small ""expansions"" called DLC. DLC that one could wait until it goes on sale and buy them a bit along.And that is why I recommend this game. A company that continually wants to expand on their property to keep it alive. If you see it as them just being greedy, you're not oblidged to buy it, but it's clear that people are still buying them. Why? because they enjoy the game.That's the point of games. To enjoy them. Why not have more things added to further that enjoyment. Much less have stuff added that is official, stable, and compatable.Or, if you're not happy with it, you're free to go buy the old and outdated city builders that avaiable on Steam here. SimCity4 is available...but you'll never get to see any new content or enjoy any mods with that game."
1,28.5,Recommended," March 12, 2015",174,"When starting off Cities Skylines I thought that the game would be another typical city builder with a mere simcity interface slap on it. The game proven that it has done many thing right the first time its come out and exceeded what sim city was however there is more work needed for the game especially in terms of the end game content. Overall the game itself is an exceptional city builder that everyone has to play if you enjoy this genre.YouTube™ Video: Cities Skyline Review with Kenuty Views: 945My cities Skyline review, I spent over 20 hours playing and building cities.You can listen to why I loved this game but at the same time got bored with it, also steam review is up.+ Runs really well and is decently optimized, even with a bigger city depending on your rig the game would still run really smooth (Window 7 64 bit from my end)+ The interface is straight from sim city so those with experience knows how to jump into the game with ease. Easy enough for new players to understand and complex enough even for the hard edge veterans.+ The cities goes looks fantastic with modded material and district creation, the area changes on its look depending on what type of police you set in place.+ The traffic system, water, and power system all works in this game right from the start in the game creating less stress to the player( WOW!)+ The district systems lets you color out zones and implement polices for the game giving you the option to create bans on certain things such as pets or smoking ban and creating unique distrits throughout your city+ Easy to use tax system and system to use for+ Bigger map sizes for building. I had a Simcity complex where I would build in the small square a while taking up as much room as I can and being efficient as possible. It was easy enough to maintain a city and then expanding. Once expanding the city gets bigger and bigger and looks amazing.+Mod support on day one players are able to download others maps, building objects etc through steam workshop. The editor is also very easy to use and import/export material in to work with.- The game lacks depth and challenge for end game content. I find the game is easy and even on hard mode( which I play on) it was pretty easy if one knows how to balance out efficiency and building his city. In the end you will make a ton of money and just basically start plopping amazingly huge cities without a clear goal. There isn't any concept of material needs for the game to improve the lives of the people of the city (Which sim city had) to give it that extra depth.- The snap for placing road sometimes can be a bit wonky and needs a bit more work. There isn't a city preplanning tool to help you preplan and no rewind button. Once ya place it you delete it and replace it etc.- No dynamic day/night cycle and disasters. These two are important function because seeing your city glow in the night is simply amazing and having disasters give you a sort of thrill in when it does occur. Without it the game doesn't offer much of a challenge unless you mess up your electrical/water or one of the needs of necessity in which case you create a disaster from it.- The npcs are not that entertaining to watch since they do not adhere to a day and night cycle rule. Therefore they aren't as robust and dynamic if one actually follows them for a for a few.- No multiplay ( Don't know if this will ever come true in the future)- Blurry graphic at times at highest settings, turn down shift helps a bit and a bit of film grain is added to the game."

You can get more buildings that doesn't included in the ""vanilla"" like garbage recycling center which doesn't produce ground polution, substation for expanding the electricity coverage without placing any power plant or windmill, also KFC and Burger King which is nice. You can make and change the transporation route by land (buses, trains, subways), sea (ships, cargo ships) and air. You can also create your own park and building (assets) for more variation to your own city, and don't forget you can create your own map too.Seems complicated, but no, it's not. It's very enjoyable, exciting and yeah, time-killing.Those DLCs are very nice to be included, but for me it's kinda expensive.Overall, it's 9/10 from me."

12,8.9,Recommended," January 3, 2016",633,"Cities: Skylines is a city builder developed by Colossal Order, the guys who were responsible for making the Cities in Motion series, and published by Paradox Interactive, and I have to say this is hands down the best city builder we’ve ever had on Steam .The size of the game is astonishing, by default the game features a 36km^2 map which is almost ten times the size of the map we’re given in SimCity 2013, and with the help of mods from the Steam Workshop, this can be expanded to a mind boggling 100km^2. Even though there are no interactions between cities that are on different maps, it is frankly not necessary, with the help of the powerful yet easy to use building tool, you can build multiple cities on a single map.Despite its humongous size, the developers paid close attention to details, in fact, detail is the word I’ll use to describe this game. From the entire traffic network, down to individual citizens, every aspect in Cities: Skylines are properly simulated. You’ll find lorries, colour coded depending on what they are currently carrying, delivering their cargoes to their designated factories, citizen actually living in a permanent home, and ambulances rushing to accident scenes, then little paramedics will get out of their vehicle, and few seconds later return with a patient on a stretcher.I also love how water works in this game as well as the fluid physics, it is completely unnecessary to have it in a city builder but in this case it has added so much more to the experience. Water has currents and flows, so you'll want to pump water on the upstream and set up sewage pipes on the opposite end, else you’ll start pumping polluted sewage water back into the system. You can even drain a lake dry completely, or accidentally flooding your city because you demolished a dam, playing with water has never been so fun.This is a city builder perfected, and with the support of Steam Workshop, further enriched by the endless creativity of the community. Cities: Skylines is a must buy for anyone who has the slightest interest in city builders."

One can see what future improvement to this game entails: good modding support gives developer better insight into what players want.3. A new era for city-building game. Cities Skylines isn't perfect (eg. rough UI, lack of goals, confusing public transport, rudimentary map editor, missing your favorite type of roads, etc etc), but it shows us what's achievable, with SimCity series back on hiatus, Cities Skylines is the new standard.The future for Cities Skylines is bright, will add more comments as I play."

I always been a big fan och city builders and was a little worried that this one would not live up to my expectations, like some other games in the genre....But boy this one delivers more then I could ever hope for, it's only been out for a few days and it feels extremely well polished and the amount of effort put into the small details is amazing. Probably a quarter of the time I spent in my cities have been just enjoying how it looks and following the citizens around doing what they do. The agent system the citizens are based around works quite good and basically everything can be renamed, from people to buildings.It is also possible to zone different regions in the city and give them individual focuses and different policies wich is an amazing feature that does alot for the immersion, and I would imagine could be awesome for those that likes to recreate irl cities.The tools the game has available for creating roads is really solid to, personally I love to create spaghetti junctions and overly complicated networks that barely work and then try to fix them up. The traffic simulator is working and it feels like it responds to changes in the network quite well. Public transport for the game I have mixed feelings about, you have to manually create lines for busses, trains etc using a similar but less complicated system from Cities in Motion. This has the potential to be something really good but at the same a tedious task, and it makes me wish there were more tools to track groups of citizens travelling paths.I haven't played around with mods and custom assets yet but the built in features seems to be really good and the steam workshop integration allows easy access to other peoples creations, some amazing mods for this is bound to happen.I could write alot more about this but I don't have time...

He will go to work,chill at a park, play on his tablet in his back yard or on his balconey.And then you zoom out to a City on the scale of mexico city or new york.its enough to get lost for hours at a time.In adition to the amazing vanillla features, the game has full mod support so you can add first person mod,new houses even add tiny props the size of a flower pot.The game itself is extremely robust. i have been downloading random mods giving no thought on compatibility so i can see how the game handles mods.i only started to get problems when i reached page 40 on my mod list.And that stability under mods is the best i have seen in any game.Take Arma 3 for instance.here is a game that was build with modding in mind and that game starts to get game breaking issues once the number of mods break the 20 mod number.This leaves the game open to create your perfect city.dont have a house you want. make it.Put that all together and you have without a doubt in my mind the best city builder game the world has ever seen."

150,229.2,Recommended," March 12, 2015",44,"In my opinion, this picks up the torch from Simcity 4. It is an actual city building game (which doesn't require an internet connection btw) that has pretty much everything I liked about the older games in it, but it also adds in a few fresh mechanics that keep things interesting. The traffic patterning, the modeling of pollution, and the electrical grid I find to be vast improvements over older games mechanically, and I love the water effects as well(I spent a good 5 minutes watching a dam fill up. It was mesmerizing) The only thing that I can gripe about if I get really nitpicky is that you have to plan transit routes and I would like more transport options. However, those could be easily rectified with a mod similar to NAM for simcity 4, and this game is designed to be easily moddable. Other than that, it's a very stable game which isn't terribly resource intensive for your PC. 10/10 would inadvertantly flood the highway leading into town with a dam again."
337,76.2,Recommended," April 25, 2017",29,"Cities: Skylines is an amazing city builder game. You don't just place the appropriate buildings to gain their benefit as in other, more plain, city builders. In Cities: Skylines you actually need to plan your city logically. Traffic, pollution, healthcare, deathcare, fire safety, police safety, and disaster safety all matter.A city can be crippled poorly designed intersection(s) and logistics. This can lead to several outcomes. A fire may take out your industry if fire trucks cannot reach the location. Pollution can make people sick. If these sick people die they must be taken to a cemetary. I think it is fun to design cities that effectively mitigate most of these things. Each gameplay is different for me. This is especially true if you play with random disasters. I would recommend this as it certainly adds character to your city and its design."

This is one of my favorite games and it makes me happy you keep adding more content to it rather than a sequel but I, and I'm sure many others too, prefer additions to gameplay rather than useless buildings."
166,107.3,Recommended," April 4, 2015",19,"After 10 hoursThis has been a very pleasant city simulator so far in big part due to the user-friendly user interface and mechanics. The city is a joy to build, prod and tweak and you only need a few keys and your mouse buttons. While many good lessons have been learned from mobile gaming (simple menu structures, addictive feedback FX, hint stream, etc.), the game offers a good amount of depth, freedom and player challenge. The city will grow automatically but not run itself and will certainly need a strategist and grand architect. The player's role is as it should be: balancing, optimising and developing the city, not monitoring every last building and citizen, yet you still can if you want to! Speaking of, the citizens behave in a consistent and logical manner (if not an entirely rational one, but that is arguably good simulation!), making the city feel alive and controllable.- Fun to play, full mechanics, satisfies tweakers, AI is good.The Steam Workshop support brings a massive boost to the content just weeks after release: if you struggle with building intersections like I do, there are dozens, even hundreds of ready-made and user-tested Workshop ones available! No more eternal gridlock! There are also buildings, decorations and all sorts of stuff if the basic selection gets too repetitive. The default selection is nicely finished and has a good level of detail.- Steam Workshop provides ideas, help and variety.The only negatives so far are the pretty limited soundtrack, not enough variety in Chirper messages, no road ruler (grid), and the Steam Workshop items are missing their thumbnails. These are minor inconveniences so far and two can be circumvented; play your own music and keep a manageable number of content installed so you know what is what. The roads do snap straight, but sometimes it is not clear when they do, and different angles are hard to produce accurately.All in all a great experience so far, and I haven't seen half the content yet!PS. Compared to SimCity? Better flow, nicer UI mechanics, less obtuse, better mod and community support - and no EA/Origin! There is a Paradox account you can register, but it is not mandatory. I don't know how the performance will be once my city reaches beyond two map squares, but so far there have been no slowdowns or glitches.Still going strong; the game has switched focus from pure growth to efficiency and large-scale management. I still get to build simple and fun new places (these maps feel pretty huge), but the core of the city is now an optimiser's dream. Education, roadworks and public transit are a real balancing act.I still can't get enough even after failing two cities miserably - they just feel like learning experiences. My main city is a place I constantly want to go back to and build and improve.The engine shows no signs of slowing down or glitching even with four (or was it five) map squares built, and game load times are fantastic. No real bugs or glitches in sight, everything Just Works. Except Tweeter; that thing is really starting to annoy me, because it has no relevance or variety anymore.Still very much Recommended."

That said, as long as you don't zoom too far into the rodas, you can maintain a steady FPS with most mid-range PC's.Absolutely recommend this game as the best City Builder ever made."

But the most annoying problem is it's traffic I guess. Sometimes, they prefer to go 1 lane than using all the lane that are available and caused the traffic jams.And also the death waves occur when you plot a big area of residential at once. What happen is they will die simultaneously as they have the same age and the hearse cannot pickup all the dead body at once and most of the citizen will abandon your city. So you need to build your city slowly and not plotting huge area of residential at once.Other than that, it is a good game and I really enjoyed playing this.

173,210.6,Recommended," September 4, 2016",23,"I was always interested in city building games, even if only on the level of mapping the streets and zoning.After the infamous flop of SimCity 2013, Cities Skylines just appeared out of the blue to take over most of the internet, as one of the most comprehensive and high quality modern city simulators around.Thanks to the After Dark update, the game looks positively gorgeous. Sure, the models and textures are quite poor up close, but the game wasn't designed to be viewed from a pedestrian's perspective, despite the (admittedly awesome) first person mods. But simply looking towards the horizon, above your city, it's magical.The music is cheerful - repetitive a bit, but cheerful and fits the bustling city atmosphere. Chirper starts off as a nice way to learn from your citizens how your city's faring, then becomes grating with the same tweets being given off about cats rescued by fire detectors, or how nice a place the city is. The rest of the sounds nail the busy metropolis theme.Gameplay is stellar, and very, very strategic. You lay down roads of various widths, then zone out areas for either residential, commercial or industrial buildings. Put down a coal plant, or several wind turbines, and deliver power to the masses. Set up the water pumping station and the sewage dumps - but be careful not to leave sewage upstream of the pumping station. Lay down services, such as medical clinics, fire stations, police stations, landfills and so on, and make sure they get as much coverage as possible. Create leisure zones, parks and other attractions, reduce noise and pollution, and allow for decent public services, to improve land value and level up buildings. Expand as your city does.The degree of simulation is such that you can follow individual ""cims"" walking out of their house, to their car, driving through junctions (and maybe getting caught in the infamous jams), reach their workplace or education facility, spend some time there, then return home. Every single citizen has a little schedule to follow. The water, which you can channel through a dam to power your city, is fully simulated, and badly placed dams and waterfront protection can cause flooding, which is not exactly good for your city. Traffic is the player's biggest threat - if you don't plan way, way ahead what you're doing, you are going to grind your city to a halt.The modding community is fantastic, providing addons ranging from highway interchanges and junction types, to new buildings, to enhanced AI logic, simulation, traffic actions and so on.It is a huge rush wildly flailing in panic at the sight of multiple problems occuring across the city, almost entirely due to poor traffic flow, and so is the relief that comes after successfully dealing with said situation.I really like this game. You ought to play it."

Happy 2017!As of 7/12/16 and with 103 hours of playtime, I think I can make a solid review about this game. Long story short, I bought this because the new Sim City was trash, but I was not ready for this game to exceed my expectations.Now for a short review: (SKIP TOWARDS ""I'M TOO LAZY"" IF YOU ARE TOO LAZY TO READ THE FULL REVIEW)Cities: Skylines is a phenomenal city building game, perhaps even better than any of the Sim City games. It is a sandbox game that has an unlimited replay value and will devour hours of your days. Its laid-back graphic style, realistic audio effects, and relaxing music provide a calm and entertaining game time. The game unrestrically allows you to build at your own pace while providing a fun challenging experience.While the game is a little tough on beginners (it has very few basic tutorials) it still seems easy to get a hang of. With time, and the Steam community guides, you will become a master of this game and having done so without much frustration, a simple learning curve.Between all of the user created mods, bountiful amount of vanilla game content, and developers amazing DLC, you will undoubtedly enjoy every game session and you will never find the game repetitive.I, without any hesitation, fully recommend Cities: Skylines to anyone interested in purchasing this. Even if you are new to the city building genre, you will appreciate every cent you paid for this game because of what it has to offer.I'M TOO LAZYPros:- Limitless replayability- Abundant game content (including free mods and game DLC)- Steam workshop support- Challenging but funCons:- Larger cities can reduce framerates, even on beefy computers- Difficult for new players (lacks necessary tutorials)- OST unintersting (unlike Sim City 4) and the DLC radio music isn't very goodI'm sure I will have missed some things (both good and bad) worth mentioning so feel free to comment on this review or ask questions in the discussions.

On top of that the performance (unlike other sims) stays excellent even if you have a massive running city."

223,76.5,Recommended," March 11, 2015",54,"This is pretty much much improved/fixed version of the latest SimCity, with some pros and cons of its own:Pros:- Maps are much bigger. Each starting city part is already bigger than tiny SimCity maps and you can buy adjacent lands to make it x9 times bigger still.- Smarter traffic controls. Though there are some issues with cars disappearing or turning in the middle of the road or going through each other - at least routing works. You don't have to wait hours for an ambulance or fire truck to reach its point, garbage gets collected, resources get sold.- Paint and fill tools for zoning (finally!).- Road connections can be edited. You are not restricted to just one entry point.- Pipes and power lines are back.- Can move buildings to another spot for a fee.- Fluid mechanics when placing an electric dam.- Overall better UI, city info panels and responsiveness (no fudged data like in SimCity - the number of workers and residents adds up).Cons:- Plopping/building snapping. Unfortunately they added the same damn thing as in SimCity and restricted placing buildings only near roads. This results in a lot of wasted space between road connections and in small spaces. It cannot be switched off either.- No tutorial whatsoever and the hint system doesn't cover everything. Took me a while to realize that my elderly population doesn't work and i have to constantly build new houses like in Banished.- No landscaping tools.- Not enough parks. Most of them are huge so there is really no way to make beautiful city centres unless you are building in squares.- Weather and time of day do not change.- Zoning and placing roads is often a chore since they rarely snap at proper angles... again unless you build in squares.- Annoying sounds and twitteresque replacement of the ""news ticker"" from SimCity.- Biased approach to power plants - they are basically forcing you to be eco friendly since wind turbines are cheaper and more efficient than everything else. This is very unrealistic and unfair in my opinion.- Can't view overlays and build at the same time. Huge oversight since you need to know where to zone industrial for ore and farm placement.- All of the public transportation lines look the same, got same colour (all of the bus lines are the same colour and all of the metro lines too) and are generally hard to create and distinguish.- Lack of building upgrades. This probably was the only good idea from SimCity that should've been copied here.Overall there are quite a few annoyances and issues at the moment but all of them are compensated by the fact that this game is actually fun and doesn't feel like a couped up tiny sandbox like SimCity.Its definitely better than CitiesXL as well, since it performs and runs smoother, uses more than 1 core, does not appear to have memory leaks and feels generally better made. The only issue i've encountered so far is some sound stuttering.So i can recommend this if you like city building games and were disappointed by every other game in the last few years."

82,175.6,Recommended," May 7, 2017",35,"Overview:Every fan of management simulation games will obsess over Cities: Skylines while anyone who would enjoy the challenge of growing a city will have a great time with this game if they can tolerate the repetetive nature that hardcore management simulation fans thrive under.You grow the city, get more types of services and problems to confront, spend money where needed, and hope that your city can reach the next classification of city type, which grants more money, unlocks new buildings, and that takes you back to square one. This style of gameplay sometimes gets too repetetive even for my aspie mindset of repetition, but playing this game in short bursts helps me tackle city problems and prevents me from staring at the screen with a blank expression wondering about what to do next while I wonder about how to use what little money I have to expand with while I'm unable to secure any more financing, and see money trickle into my account. (And sometimes watch money run out, depending on which way my luck cuts.)Graphics and sound:It's obvious from the get-go that this sort of game is graphics intensive, and Cities: Skylines is excellent in the graphics department. You can easily see things like rain and fog, and see them all either up close, far away, and in full 3D. But for better or worse, fog is mostly visible from far away, and not from up close.The animation and graphics for pollution is absolutely perfect. You can not only see the dirty, filthy, stinking haze close up, but you can also see it from far away on buildings that pollute.The only real complaint about graphics, is that industries involved in oil drilling do not build oil derricks on top of their zones.It actually took me a long time to turn on the sound, and I only did so for the sake of writing a review. There's nothing awe-inspiring or game-breaking about the game's sounds, but I really disliked the music. The music was totally out of place, especially for viewing densely populated areas and streets with densely packed traffic. Your best bet is to just move the main volume slider to 0%, and play music that's to your liking. Of course, you are free to mute the music volume should you want to hear the game and also listen to your own music.Positives:This game is so awesome, I cannot include everything I like about Cities: Skylines. (I tried, but my original review would not fit when I tried to copy and paste!) Cities:Skylines takes features from past city management sims, and takes them to a whole new level without feeling outright like a copycat game. I will say that Cities: Skylines has everything I enjoy about city management games dating back to 1990 and the added ability to rename buildings of every kind, create districts, and rename these districts to anything one wishes.Negatives:While I do love Cities: Skylines, I am bothered by some of the game's flaws, and there's enough flaws, I'm unable to bury the reader in as many paragraphs as I wanted, but I made the mistake of including things that I wish were features, or what I thought should be done differently. With a city of close to 36,000 people, the only complaints I have room to mention, is that collection of trash and dead bodies is deeply flawed. It doesn't matter if one has enough landfill or incenerator capacity or space in cemetaries and creamatories, the larger your city becomes, the more likely you can expect to see icons over buildings indicating filthy, stinking garbage and rotting corpses desperately in need of disposal, and the game does nothing to prioritize collection.A game as complex as Cities: Skylines certainly requires a tutorial, but none is included in game. Certainly the most seasoned of us need an interactive lesson in the fundamentals.The act of forbidding tractor trailers from operating on roads via city ordinance seems like a good idea at first, it really bothers me that banning tractor trailers on specific streets (and sometimes stretches of streets) requires making micro-districts dedicated solely to vehicle bans.Conclusion:Cities: Skylines has the city management game genre cornered. No other city management sim competes. Buy this game. Buy it at any price. If you can wait for a sale, that's cool, too. If you like the idea of giving cities a unique feel, you have the ability to rename many of the things you see on see in your city. And when you do buy this game, you should check out the DLC available for Cities: Skylines. Some of them are really cool, but others look like awful moneygrabs that you would think only Electronic Arts would inflict upon the gaming world. You should especially check out tutorials for this game before you start playing it, because if you don't, you can expect quite a bit of trial and error in the building of your city, and that could end up costing you lots of money. Especially make sure you read the manual, unless you want to look at the forums (or ask questions that were long since asked) about how to build elevated roads.The game, however, is still plenty of good fun without any DLC's or custom content, so you can expect lots of fun times playing Cities: Skylines. Just be sure to let your friends and family know they'll never hear from you again, and be prepared to stay up all night."

943,42.1,Recommended," March 10, 2015",135,"Cities Skylines is said to be a ""modern take on the classic city simulation"" and after playing around for many hours, it is on that path and it's the best we have of a new modern city building simulator, and it's the best we will probably have for a while.This is, to an extent, the city building game we've been waiting for, at least the best one we're going to get that's is satisfying, not buggy, not overly restricting, but one that's made with care, that's free from tiny shackles, with freedom and space to have creativity built in it, and one that's design nicely, combined with support for community support.YouTube™ Video: Cities Skylines Gameplay Preview Views: 176We go to play around with it, and it's better than all city building games of recent years. More info at: http://KSalue.com End video song: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVafDaVTVkk ~Twitter:...The look of the game is decently great, at least better looking that a rehashed game for the third time, but lowers than a heavily funded one. it's working, compared to other recent city builders, it has minimal bugs, runs smoothly, even hours after playing the game with a lot of structures being built. The restrictions on the game at its peek is minimal, exponentially smaller than a triple-A produced game of recent years, with the ability to remove all restrictions.The gameplay is slick and smoother, with normal decent controls and a good UI, and an even more detailed view of finer data like the space need to build a structure alongside a road, a better resource and feedback view, and other new elements introduced like noise pollution with elements and tools at hand to counter it. The game uses a nice system of the industry type zoning, with placing them in specific types of land with resources, and then applying the type of work they do with the use of the district painting tool. Certainly a new way of production that I haven't seen before, and it's kind of nice and sort of makes some sense instead of having just one building produce one specific type in mass.The transportation and traffic controls in the game is real and it packs a punch, as it was created by the same developers who made Cities In Motion 1 & 2, which was mainly focused and is specialized on the transportation systems. So if you don't have a nice road map for you city, you will probably have issues with other cervices doing their jobs and as a result having more issues to deal with, which is great.The problems with the game consist of the game not teaching you well enough on how the systems work, but you I managed to learn almost everything to make a decently big city on my second playthrough. My first time playing the game was arguably created a horrible city, but my second playthrough was a lot nicer after having all the experience and knowledge I gained from my first go at it, and at this point it's fine tuning with my third time at creating a nice city. Not a problem, more of a nit picky thing, the monuments in the game where mediocre in it's scale and design, as I wasn't overwhelmed by it's looks or scale. Plus, the game doesn't have any sort of flying services, which left me heavily focusing on my structural groundwork immensely more so I don't screw up later on and damage my city.Overall Cities Skylines is a wonderful city builder that I and many others needed, from the glorious days of the past, to the disappointments of modern times concerning a nice city builder, SC brings joy and hope that we finally get to have in this genre, for the asking price and for what you get and what you will get later on with support for community support, this is a definite good purchase.Shameless to original post"

90,122.2,Recommended," March 16, 2015",24,"First of all, I had very high expectations, and that's never a good thing. Secondly, I played SimCity 4: Rush Hour until today.Now I don't have to, because I have Cities: Skylines, which is truly a successor of it.PROs:- Road-engineering is really next-gen!- The graphics/physics are not just good, but feature cool/cute details too (for example, when a truck ramps on a highway, it bounces a bit)- I love the water/wind simulation (besides it is just a very small part of the game)- People-based simulation is fascinating, and even over 40.000 population the game runs perfectly- The different map layers look good, and are useful- The game is almost bug-free on day one! (Hello EA, I am waving at you)- Map size is small at the beginning, but can be expanded later, at the end is somewhat the same size as the 4x4 in SimCity 4, which is huge (EA? Are you still here?)- Mod and custom asset support!CONs:- It is hard and easy at the same time. Let me explain: to make a perfect traffic in a big city is almost impossible, if you don't want to destroy everything and make your city a big highway intersection (which I am not a fan of). On the other hand, keeping everything in terrible traffic have no consequences at all! I think this is bad, because the game doesn't reward you if you make a good traffic. I have just watched a stream when a guy used only dirty roads in his city over 40.000 pop, and the city worked perfectly. In SimCity 4, when you do this, people moves out of their homes, because the commute time is so high, and so the offices/commercial/industry will fall too. I really hope they will fix this.- The public transportation has some issues too. According to my experiences, only buses can be operated profitable. Also, train traffic is ridiculous: even a metropolis should have less train-traffic, and most of them operate nearly empty (10/240 passengers or so).- I am not a big fan of working cities with only skyscapers. In SimCity 4, when you zone high density residential, but people feel they don't want to live in a mega-block, they will build some low-dense housing instead. Like in a normal city. Here, you zone high-everything, and they just build a Manhattan in the middle of nothing.But overall this is a great game, and I highly recommend it! Also, I am quite sure they will fix all the bugs and consider changing some of the cons I mentioned. Happy gaming!"
12,"3,791.9",Recommended," November 4, 2017",135,"3,000+ hours. enough said. buy it.To all the DLC haters,you don't have to buy them. If you're discovering this game for the first time, it can be overwhelming, i get it. It's like the sims a few years after one comes out, but the thing is...the base game is SO MUCH FUN! and with the steam workshop (im pretty sure cities has the most # of items in workshop out of any game) it's really a lot of bang for your buck.Over 2.5 years, paradox has released several DLC's for people who play heavily, such as myself, to get new gameplay in exchange for support for the programmers. Thats how it works. All these freeloaders mad because they want the content for free, like no, if there was no incentive and it was free, they wouldn't make it in the first place and you wouldn't even have an option for snow/night/etc. we would just have base game city because no one wants to pay extra. The bottom line is that DLC's help the company and people who play a lot and want new content. I can honestly recommend every DLC except Concerts and the Art Decos/radio stations. but if you're new, just buy the base game on sale for $7.99. + steam workshop you'll have 100s of hours of enjoyable gameplay, no fuss.One last note, i would like to see QUALITY DLC's in the future. Green Cities DLC has 100s of items and new features and costs $13, Concerts DLC adds one new thing and costs $7. the prices are not proportional for the content, i would like to see more green city DLCs."
402,44.0,Recommended, February 6,19,"This is the best citysim to come out in a long, long time. Cities: Skylines not only towers above EA's perfunctory 2013 SimCity reboot, it stands up with the all time classics of that series, striking a balance between SimCity 3000's accessibility and SimCity 4's depth. That's to say nothing of how redundant it renders the samey Cities XL series. The base game is alright by itself, but not only are there already more DLCs and expansions than SimCity 4 ever got, Steam Workshop integration makes finding and using player-created mods ten times easier than it was for SimCity 4.The only real problems I can think of are that there isn't much of a tutorial for new players - they just get interface popups every time they start a new city - that the user interface isn't quite as intuitive as in the classic SimCity games, and that some of the expansions/DLCs are rather light on content, although that's more of a publisher thing than an actual problem with the game. These are more learning curve problems than anything, and can be overcome with time and perhaps an internet guide or two, although I'd heartily accept an expanded tutorial. Some of the other expansions add great stuff too, so players can pick and choose if they feel like they want more to the game.For people new to city simulators, I'd say this is the best you could possibly do apart from going over to GOG and picking up SimCity 3000. While some of the expansions add goal-oriented scenarios, the meat of the game is in freeform city building. It gives you more freedom than any previous citysim did while maintaining the experience of managing a city, and for people who just want to make things look pretty, there's a built-in infinite money option that removes budget worries.For people who are already familiar with classics like SimCity 4, well, frankly you probably already own this game, but a rundown here won't hurt you any. It's generally a worthy successor, and the easier modding alone makes it worth picking up if you haven't for some reason. It adds a couple of the EA reboot's better features, principally freeform roads and optional resource extraction. More attention must be paid to traffic logistics, given that public services now actually utilize your road system, and perennial traffic jams kind of make it hard for garbage trucks to make their rounds, as just one example. Sewage also must be dumped back out somewhere - hopefully not in the same place your water pump is taking input. The in-game radio stations are neat, and a couple of the DLC ones even have jazz reminiscent of SimCity's music.I'd like to close by saying how great it is that there's an entire expansion dedicated to ""green cities"" and climate sustainability. Even if it is paid content, the mere thought counts for a lot. The main game, at least, is well worth picking up at any price."

I remember playing Sims City 4 Deluxe Edition and thinking of how good it was, this game may have surpassed it's greatness. This game released a little over two years after the disaster that was Sims City 5. Picture everything wrong with that game, then think of the exact opposite and you have Cities: Skylines.- Very good graphics.- The little details (building signs, people biking, store fronts, etc).- Few repetitive buildings in close proximity, looks more realistic.- The traffic system (yes, it has some positives but I'll address the negatives in the cons below).- Day/Night cycle, it almost seems to change the whole look of your city.- Well optimized.- Frequent updates and patches.- Water physics.- Traffic will stay in one lane even if it is a 6 lane highway. What is the point of having different road types if your citizens use one lane? It is not a deal breaker for this game, but it does pull you out of the fantastic city environment Paradox Interactive worked so hard to make.- Maybe 2-3 crashes within my small time played.

2,33.7,Recommended," August 2, 2016",54,"Teal DeerDevelopers: Colossal Order Ltd.Publishers: Paradox InteractiveInitial release: March 2015Genre: Simulation, City Builder#Worth/NotWorth: #WorthExposition, Concurrence and SummationCities: Skylines is a city builder and economy simulator in the vain of the oh so fallen from grace SimCity.Skylines is essentially a sandbox for you to plan out, build certain amenities and hopefully people will want to move in and make your city thrive.Initially when you first jump into the game it starts with many of the options grayed out and it sort of gates you in this manner as you get used to the basics of building roads and zoning out areas as well as providing electricity, water and sewage treatment facilities. Then, as things unlock such as healthcare facilities and schools, you'll be able to get a better grasp of each system.You'll have access to crime, fire safety reports. As well as noise and actual pollution overlays. Should you desire to “go green” the use of wind turbines are also available as well as a corresponding wind chart for peak efficiency.The game makes use of a relatively humorous but sometimes annoying fake twitter for your citizens to @mention you and tell what you're doing wrong and in rare cases what you are doing right. At least in my experience.You can inact policies like water preservation or power conservation and even things like mandatory smoke alarms in homes. Typically, at the cost of increased upkeep while decreasing use of resources or in this specific case the likelihood of fire even though that's not technically what fire alarms do. This is how the game “gameifies” that sentiment.There are weather effects and a day/night cycle. Which led to a moment I don't often have in gaming that was slightly existential. For setup, I was early on in my learning the game and had not really understood how to get things going faster when the first night struck. Without power, without people living in my city, it was entirely pitch black; And I had this rather obvious realization the more I think about it but at the time was borderline transcendental though I'm not fond of the connotations of that word; I was sat there “We really are just floating on a rock out in space”. As though this was not already obvious to everyone. This just seemed like a very odd and probably the least likely of places or style of game for someone to have that thought process. Let alone in a game at all.The game also features mod and steam workshop support which leads to nearly endless types of buildings and other various ideas that modders can come up with.There is also economy and budget screens to adjust taxes on different districts or different zones. As well as increase or decrease funding of maintenance on city utilities and services.If I had anything bad to say about the game is that it is not always overtly clear how to do something. It requires a lot of tooling around and experimenting. In a very specific example setting up bus routes is rather ill contrived, at times down right purposely misleading in its functionality. Though a tutorial on proper usage can easily be sought out if need be outside the game.It also features what I'd consider a fairly unique aesthetic. It does indeed have a film grain slider. Which when combined with the depth of field and lighting gives this almost physical model like appeal. Like it's a table in your basement with your model trains running along it. Zooming in, if you just look down a street it almost feels alive. I want to invoke the powers of Mr. Rodgers here but I fear the reference may be lost among the traffic."

120,151.1,Recommended," September 18, 2015",28,"Cities: Skylines.... Where do I start. I have played this game for what does it say, 18 hours or something like that? I dont even know anymore. The reason I do not know anymore is because when you start playing Skylines hours in real life seem to just disappear. You can start for the first time at 8 pm and not even realize it is now well past midnight.You start your city with nothing but an in an out road. Maybe a Train track. You build, you develop neighborhoods, commercial areas, and industrial areas just like in all the SimCity games. Eventually you get enough people to buy an expansion slot which allows you to make your city bigger, and bigger and bigger until eventually you have this huge map that seems like there is no end to it.The only grip I would say I have about this game is that there is a max amount of expansion slots you can buy for your city. Which I guess is alright, but it would be nice if you could just keep going and going. Then again I dont know how well that would work or even if you could keep up with maintaining the whole city from Burned Down buildings or abandonded buildings, or making sure there are enough Cemetarys in your city to go an pick up all the dead bodies each day.Do I recommend this game? ♥♥♥♥ yeah."
56,21.0,Recommended, April 10,13,"This is the first city builder simulator that I have player, EVER. The reason behind it is because I tend to be very bad at organizing my priorities in games such as this. Too many factors to take into account. Too many different things that could, and will, go wrong if you're not careful. It's just who I am. For whatever reason, probably a price drop and the good reviews, I decided to purchase the game. At first I was a complete mess, lost doing the simplest things, but instead of abandoning it as I would have a few months ago, I decided to look for some tips on youtube, and then a few guides. I was hyped that you could do so much with the city and started playing and building randomly at first, trying out stuff I had seen. Some of it worked, some of it didn't.The thing is, I started to like what I used to hate about these type of simulators. When my city didn't work anymore, I built a new city and started again. I think now I have the hold of most of the basics and I'm ready to move on to the next step! Maybe buying another slot.

195,40.0,Not Recommended," October 20, 2017",757,"Cities: Skylines is a great city sim game; possibly one of the best out there. It's intuitive, pretty, and addictive to play. There's a lot of little milestones and unlocks that constantly nudge you gently forward and give you just one more thing to fix, one more thing to tweak, one more thing to add. Suddenly your city is booming and you need to place more residential. Now there's more traffic and you need to rework your roads. Once those are handled you notice some new buildings and services have unlocked, and you begin planning around where they should go. It's a great system, and the game never feels hectic or rushed. You can always do things at your own pace, which really benefits a city-building game in my mind.All that said, I can't recommend this game unless it's heavily on sale. Not because it's a bad game. It's not - it's a great game. But Paradox's DLC practices are nausea-inducing. The base game has enough to get by and have fun, but there's a ton of ease-of-living and sometimes downright necessary functions locked behind completely useless DLC. They did it with Crusader Kings, they did it with Europa Universalis, and now they're doing it here, so I doubt they plan to stop any time soon. The Transit DLC adds a ton of public transport functionality...for $13. You can set your city up to cater to the night life, with night clubs and 24/7 stores...for $15. There can be natural disasters and buildings to mitigate their damage, adding a fun bit of chaos to otherwise totally safe gameplay...for $15. And now, with the Green Cities DLC, they've added a ton of new and useful content, but locked it all behind a paywall. Most of this is stuff that should've been in the base game, or free updates. Why does a customer need to pay to unlock winter or the ability to recycle? It boggles the mind.It's a great game marred by awful DLC practices. If you want to buy it, buy it on sale and do some research on the available DLC beforehand so you can decide which bits of game functionality you are willing to pay for in order to fully enjoy the game."

115,11.8,Recommended," December 25, 2016",20,"Much as I prefer to let each game stand on its own, certain games demand comparisons. In the case of Cities: Skylines, developer Colossal Order has overtly modeled its game after SimCity – not just the fundamental concept and methods of building and maintaining a simulated city from the ground up, but much of the look and feel as well. And on almost every count, Skylines compares very favorably to the former standard-bearer of the city-building genre. It is, in fact, the best of its kind to come along in a full decade – a powerful, flexible, beautiful, and all-around impressive simulation that lets you build sprawling, single-player metropolises to your heart’s content. Building has to be its own reward, though, because the lack of random events or disasters leaves the job of running these towns feeling sleepy and meditative.Playing as part mayor, part god-king with the power to arbitrarily bulldoze your simulated citizens’ dreams and create schools with a click, building a city from scratch is mostly conventional: lay down roads with the easy-to-use tools, designate zones for residential, commercial, or industrial buildings, provide utility services, reap the tax boon, then repeat the cycle with new stuff that’s been unlocked by your growing population hitting new milestones. Skylines finds a mostly happy medium between the complexity of SimCity 4 and the relative simplicity of SimCity 2013 by automatically attaching zoneable areas to roads as they’re laid, but still holding onto obligatory busywork like laying water pipes. Those basics are all tried and true - you couldn’t have a city-builder without them - so it’s mandatory that they be done well. Cities: Skylines does that.The first way this sim knocks it out of the park is in its scale. Each game begins as deceptively small, constricting you to a four-square-kilometer area (the same size as a SimCity map, entirely by coincidence I’m sure), but quickly allows you to buy access to an adjacent plot of land of equivalent size. Then it does this seven more times, for a total possible area of 36 square kilometers. Suffice it to say, there’s plenty of room. And while you can’t directly edit terrain while you play, there’s an included map editor where you can create any land mass you choose before you jump in - or download one from the prominently integrated Steam Workshop mod support.With such large cities, it’s fantastic that Skylines allows you to define and regulate areas individually. Simply paint a chunk of your city with the District tool, and you can not only name it so you can spot it easily on the map, but give it unique policies that regulate everything from mandating smoke detectors to reduce fire hazards (at a cost) to legalizing recreational drug use for lower crime rates, or banning highrise buildings to create defined downtown and suburban areas. In industrial zones, you can specialize the businesses to exploit a map’s natural resources in the area to mine ore, drill for oil, farm on fertile land, or harvest trees for forestry. You can even create tax incentives for a specific type of zone within each district.Let’s zoom in for a moment: we can see individual humans walking through the streets, going to work or school, engaging in leisure activities, or returning home by the thousands. They drive cars, take trains, and even walk dogs. (You can individually name them, but I suggest naming them Waldo, because there are so many that if you find that specific one again you I say you basically win the game.) This is where you realize the time scale becomes absurd. On the slowest speed a day lasts 10 seconds – three and a half on the fastest – which means the journey to work could last a week. But the lack of a day and night cycle means time doesn’t seem too unnatural, but rather an abstraction to serve the speed at which things are built and tax money flows in.Making a major city’s traffic flow smoothly is a puzzle I haven’t come close to fully cracking yet, but I do feel good when I easily create overpasses and freeway onramps to experiment with routes that direct the flow and ease the gridlock... at least partially. By default, most advanced road types are locked out at the start, which makes planning a city around trains or subways nearly impossible (unless you plan on supervillain-level demolition later on), but there’s a sandbox mode that’ll allow you to build whatever you want, whenever you can afford it. (There’s also an unlimited money mode.)Mass transit is a tricky beast. It’s not enough to lay down bus stops and train stations; you have to plot out routes individually, or no one will go anywhere. It’s easy to get lost in that, especially as routes start overlapping and it’s frustrating to get your bus stop placed on the correct side of each narrow road. But there are a lot of options, and the endorphin rush from making a red traffic data overlay turn green makes it all worth it.Up close, buildings are colorful and detailed, right down to small animations like rooftop fans spinning. A slider in the options menu gives us control over the amount of depth-of-field blur applied to distant buildings when zoomed in, which mimics SimCity’s attractive diorama effect. Skylines doesn’t match the graphical quality of SimCity, though, and given the great numbers we see them in they don’t quite have the variety needed to prevent most neighborhoods from looking pretty much the same.What Skylines isn’t good at is telling you what you’ve done wrong, and what problem you need to solve right now. For instance, when I hit 50,000 citizens, the gauge at the bottom of the screen that indicates what new zone type my city wanted in order to expand bottomed out. It didn’t want anything at all. Hundreds of buildings were abandoned, without explanation. How can I address the issues that are hamstringing my city when I don’t know what they are, and the in-game advisors provide no insight? I built new residential, commercial, and industrial zones and waited; eventually, without my taking any deliberate action or receiving any explanation, the zones filled and growth resumed upward of 100,000. I don’t understand why.In that light, it’s fortunate that it’s fairly difficult to send your city into a death spiral without actively trying to, or making worse financial decisions than Greece. It has to be as deliberate as placing a sewage drain pipe directly upstream from your water pump – basically piping raw sewage into your citizens’ tap water – or borrowing more money than you can ever hope to repay. Even crime is disappointingly easy to keep in check with a single police station serving a town of 40,000.It’s limited to man-made crisis-management because there are no earthquakes, tornadoes, destructive floods, nuclear meltdowns, zombie outbreaks, UFO or monster attacks, or anything fun like that. The only thing close to a disaster is a fire, and those don’t spread from one building to another, even if left completely unchecked. I don’t mean to fault Skylines for not cloning every single feature of SimCity, but I do consider disaster management to be a major part of running a big city, and without it Skylines lacks a certain sense of excitement that’s been a staple of the city-building genre since the beginning.More than anything, Cities: Skylines is about the simple joy of building. It’s a really impressive and often beautiful simulation, where an amazing number of virtual people go about their business across a huge swath of land. Getting in and creating something is easy, though mastering it will require extensive research on community wikis to understand why growth is stunted even when you address your citizens’ apparent concerns. Don’t expect exciting scenarios or random events, but do expect to be impressed by the scale and many moving parts of this city-builder."

Another major complain was that this game focus is more towards modding. As a city builder game you want variety of buildings, roadways, vehicle and etc. And that is where the modding community shines. It adds flavour to the game. I'm sure you will get bored of the plain 'ol vanilla building made by the devs sooner or later. And when i scrolled through the bad reviews something caught my attention.

Better than Sim City 2013 and much better than the last two Cities XL games. There is mod support right away, you can expand your city to be much much larger, the gameplay is fun, it handles well, runs well and its a blast to play. Sure the art design could be better (seems like a cheap sc 2013 style art design), sure I miss the night and day cycle from SC and there are some bugs with drivers ai and some other stuff but overall those pale compared to all the things this game does right. Want to create a big gigantic city? You have come to the right game!Get your hands on this wonderfully crafted game and you won't be dissapointed. There is alot of options for customization, I can see hundreds of hours being spent on this game down the road, well done devs! Two big thumbs up from me, as this is the most fun I have had building stuff in a videogame since Simcity 4 and the last Anno game.

I must have started about 5 or so cities before I figured out how to even get the ball rolling, but once you do, it's incredibly compelling.I am on my first city at the moment, and although it is proving profitable, the way I laid out the roads is pretty random and has been causing traffic problems.Also, I started drawing in a totally random bus route, adding stops all over the place and now it is telling me that I haven't completed the loop for my insane bus route and I can't figure out how to complete it for the life of me...or erase it. hahaIt seems pretty bug free, and it is very well optimised. Been playing it on my GT650m laptop and it is running great at 1080p on high settings. It's a very entertaining time sink. You can easily lose hours just evolving and maintaining your city."

Obviously they are employees of Maxis.Two years ago I was amused by this game and really enjoyed it. Having now played with Mass Transit, I am amazed by what I see the cims do. This game really works!! You just have to plan.People complain about traffic in this game. Well, I live in California and notice while I am driving around Angels Camp, and other foothill communities there is not much traffic!, but when I drive in San Francisco or L.A. there is an overwhelming amount of traffic. 1+1 = Pretty much goes with the population.I decided to go with just low residential on my map and I first began with bus routes through those communities dropping them off at schools, commercial districts and clean industry areas. I noticed they RODE the busses and I made good money!Next I did trams on the out skirts and inner areas of those residential areas and noticed they rode the trams!I LOVE monorails! I always have. When I finally was able to use monorails, I decided to make a tourist area and then I plopped down the harbor for passengers. It works in this game. The tourists came. I brought the monorail to them, having HUGE bus lines from the city in the central hub. They use it! My busses are organized and no traffic!I got the airport. Obviously, I brought the monorail to it. I have seven monorail lines around my city! I have nearly 50 bus lines. I MAKE my tourists use the trams, because when they get off the monorails, it's too LONG to walk to the tourist area, so they go to the center of the road and get on the trams, which go to different tourist areas!!This game is FUN! Thankfully I watched a video and he reccommended ALWAYS use four lane roads, because they are easily upgradeable! Best advice I could share also.Mass Transit! It's what it promises! My monorails are FULL! They WAIT in line for the Trams! And they wait in line for the busses when they get off in the MAIN Monorail HUB, which has four lines servicing it!! I tinker with the monorails, trams and busses. EASY to see if a line needs more! Some lines are PACKED! I decided to put in the Space Elevator! OMG! LOL. I had to put in 3 more monorails on that line to take the passengers and four more trams!LOVE the game! Thanks so much for your efforts! I appreciate them and see what you have made. Fun!"

So I won't rehash that.What I like about Cities: SkylinesI have tried to think of counter points to the above, something negative, but I can't really name any. There are a few missteps I made in my first few games - such as planning / designing areas in a tightly aranged format, preventing easy upgrades to roads. But that's part of the learning curve I mentioned above. There's really been nothing bad about the game at all. There has been one oddity / amusing gaff: a road twisting when elevated, cornering too tightly, and positioned too close to last point - but that's the only thing.One thing I would like to suggest to the devs, is to make the single-instance trees to have more of an effect (an effect?) on noise pollution.You may be tempted to build all up on your high way access. Don't. You will rue the day you did that. Think space. You don't need to cram things in."

Honestly, this is the type of game you can play all day without getting bored as build a vibrant city.+ Easy to learn with very intuitive menues, and features that slowly unlock as your city builds. There really isn't need for any tutorials, you will learn as you play.+ Visually the game looks gorgeous, and it is a delight to go into camera-mode and just watch as your city thrives. You can even see your people as they go about their daily tasks. What is most surprising is the variety of buildings / houses / stores that are built, and they all look great.+ Day / Night Cycle and Weather to add a further sense of emersion.+ Challenging, you have a budget which you have to constantly keep an eye on. Every so often you will have growing pains, where you may suddenly run out of power or water, or perhaps a building will catch on fire, or perhaps the crime rate goes up or you run out of garbage trucks, or maybe a giant traffic jam. You have to be ready to deal with all these issues and more while trying to manage a steady tax rate and keep people from getting unhappy and moving out.+ You can buy addional plots of land and build multiple HUGE thriving cities+ Steam Workshop with a bunch of new buildings and scenerios- The biggest disappointment for me is the lack of pre-build scenerios or ""challenge levels / missions"". The main goal seems to be to just grow as large you possibly can, and then start over.- The road system could be improved a bit. It's a bit difficult to make neat and uniform roads with proper exits. On top of this, building various road types and highways is VERY expensive making it difficult to improve areas with dense congested traffic.Side Note: If you were wondering, Yes this game is far greater than Sim City"

73,94.2,Recommended," October 26, 2017",156,"Concerning the DLC Practices of Paradox Interactive & Paradox Developement StudioThe dlc practices of pdx seem offensive at first, until you learn they only release a major game once evry 5 or 6 years and then contiually update them for longer than that. They need the dlc influx to continue with their constant dedication to their projects. Ckii is more than five years old, and next month it is getting an expansion that has been stated to not be the last. The idea of 'games as a service' is actually properly done by the company and its fans and creators are open with each other and share their ideas. They are very human. The downside is that if you didn't get on the train as it was leaving the station it is very intimidating to see the long dlc lists. Most are cosmetic. It is easier to think of pdx games as a subscription in which every 4-5 months you pay a 5-20 USD subscription fee to support continued developement of the games. The dlc is optional and far better than the atroicious dlc policies of ea, activision, and ubisoft: ""Here buy this uber deluxe expansion pass edition that costs 150 USD."" Those game sare abandoned ghost towns within a year. However, with pdx games you know they will be around a while constantly increase player count. And for the price of a cheesesteak, an Arnold Palmer, and fries you can have an addtion to your game you will play for a decade. Therefore it is unfair to equate this to dlc packs in AAA games like fallout, mass effect, and assissins creed. You can either have a greedy company who puts out a disposable game like AC and asks foir over 100USD for dlc you care about for 2 months, or buy a map pack for CoD which you'll only find enough friends to play with for a year or so, or you can buy into a pdx title which is far more deep, has an amazing community, and will stick around for almost a decade. If you want the later, you have to be willing to financially support the studio who desires to continue perfecting your game. In a throw away gaming culture, I for one find pdx's practices a breath of fresh air."

EA irrevokably tarnished the reputation of the legendary, 30-year-old SimCity franchise over the course of two games (SimCity Societies, then ""SimCity""), and Colossal Order pushed them aside to give us the charming, delightful city builder we've wanted all along.Cities: Skylines vs. ""SimCity"" present a terrific example of just how catastrophic the live service model can be, with Cities: Skylines' relative simplicity and lack of extreme restrictions winning over an immense amount of good will from former SimCity fans.

So far I had a ton of fun ;)Update 05/2017: Regarding the harsh critique of the pricing of the various DLCs, the Colossal Order makes sure that every major DLC also adds free features. In fact the latest offering, Mass Transit, overhauls the road and transport line UI pretty substantially. A release price of 13€ is preeetty fair, considering there are always unique additions to your core game play. However, performance issues on higher end rigs still persist - which is a real shame.

I'll go ahead and mention the cons even though they in no way amount to anything significant enough to not get it. As a lot of people mention the traffic AI is frustrating, maybe the biggest challenge of the game. but in reality traffic is a major challenge for every city. The whole ratio of times thing is weird but best they could do i imagine. i wish the city size to population was realisitc. You have this massive metroplex with skyscrapers, multiple airports and countless suburbs and the entire population of the city is like 65000. that makes no sense. idk why they have it like that. the expansions are seemingly really expensive for what they give you so that sucks too. but just the base game is awesome. anyway overall awesome if you have a decent rig that can run it smoothly its a very relaxing but engaging gaming experience."

677,211.8,Recommended, February 14,13,"Best city simulator hands down. I must admit that it is more of a traffic management simulator rather than an all around city simulator, espically challenge wise, but you have to take what you can get. Terrible traffic AI is the only thing that makes you think about suicide now and then. Other than that a perfect game in all aspects for me. Mods makes it even better. Dlcs may become kind of a cashgrab so waiting a sale might be the better option. Definitely recommend 9.5/10.Moreover, I want to ask Colossal Order to increase or wholly abondon car/cim limit in their next game. Very few of the active gamers use a patato rig with a celeron and 2gb ram nowadays. Make it 64 bit only and give us freedom. Also fix the damn traffic AI. Sadly, mods are not enough to educate brainless drivers. Thanks for the game and your effort!"

1,20.9,Recommended," March 10, 2015",299,"Full disclosure: review copy provided by developer/publisher!I come from a long, proud line of urban planners. My father is an urban planner, as was his father, and his father before him (his father's father's father copulated with goats and is seldom brought up in polite conversation). But the fast cars/money/women/goats lifestyle of urban planning never appealed to me. Much to my family's chagrin I pursued writing, and they were (and continue to be!) devastated. Before disowning me my father sat me down at the computer and urged me to play Cities: Skylines. “This is in your blood son,” he smiled, weary from a hard day of urban planning. “Please. For me. For the family.”So I started to build my first city across from a scenic river... and, I don't know. I don't know how to explain it. It just clicked. I stretched roads in a grid and began zoning – visitors to my fair city would be greeted by our booming industry district, noisy and dirty and beautifully anarchistic; past the fuming towers they would admire our chic commercial district, busy with pedestrians and bathed in neon lights; further still they would find themselves in our residential district, with manicured lawns and parks and homes galore. But to build a city you have to do more than just plan. You have to create.I built powerful turbines to power my city and laid pipes for water to rush in and out. Satisfied I unpaused the game and watched. Slowly, skeletal structures emerged from the earth, supports were raised and lowered, and buildings became occupied. Little storefronts popped up, factories rose up, and dream homes were built. Cars flooded my little two lane streets, full of wide-eyed country bumpkins presumably. And things were good, for a time. I sat and watched my little citizens rush to and fro, traffic ebb and flow, and more buildings appear from empty lots.Perhaps my father had a point.Oh, an achievement unlocked!Bad Mayor. Have 15% Happiness.♥♥♥♥.I guess I wasn't paying close enough attention – wait, what do you mean “sewage is bubbling up?”And so my city, 420BlazeIt360NoScope, drowned in a sea of human waste. Langston Hughes, a dream deferred does indeed stink of rotten meat, for the record. It was also crusty.Cities: Skylines is the sleekest, smartest, and most potentialicious city builder available currently – and may possibly remain so thanks to integrated, dedicated modding support. You'll start off in the vanilla game with a single tract of land and an off ramp. To get your city off the ground you'll do what I mentioned previously - sans massive sewage backup. You'll zone districts, set up the water and electricity, and watch your little hamlet bustle. As your population grows so will your abilities and responsibilities. You'll have to build accessible clinics, police stations, schools, and fire stations. You'll have to keep pollution (sound, ground, and water) in check. Districts lines will be drawn and policies enacted, like establishing an industrial sector in a particularly fertile area as a farming region, or banning smoking in a residential area. Prompts will flash if garbage is getting out of hand, buildings are abandoned, taxes are too high, etc. In addition Chirper, the game's Twitter feed thingy, will tweet pertinent (if sometimes repetitive and annoying) information.With every addition and upgrade you'll have to expand further and further, balancing the budget, happiness, and health of your city along the way. Eventually you can purchase as many as nine map tiles, upgrading, rebuilding, rezoning, public transit, shipping... the scope of it is a little overwhelming (old hands at city building sims will find themselves in familiar territory and will likely have bustling metropolis' in no time. For the uninitiated I'd recommend watching the frequent Twitch streams and Youtube LPs)! Mastering C:S requires a great deal of foresight. Sure, you can build the cheap coal and oil power plants, but pollution will skyrocket and illness may spread. Build the more expensive green energy alternatives and you'll contend with noise pollution and have to choose more specific locations to place them. Traffic will begin to bottleneck on busier roads, and buildings out in the boonies will be more vulnerable to crime and fire (and fire crime, “arson” sounds much to pedestrian). When you have a breather, however, it's one of the most relaxing, satisfying games I've ever played. Watching your citizens go about their days is mesmerizing... people walk their dogs, firetrucks blare by, garbage trucks make their rounds. It feels alive.Despite some technical glitches (trains jumping tracks, cars driving into burning buildings, little oversights with no bearing that SHOULD be patched early into release), I don't really have any complaints. Yes, seasons and a night cycle would have been nice, more aesthetic “flavors” for buildings and locations would keep things fresh, and more “disasters” to deal with besides those created by player ineptitude would be fun to contend with (natural, human, seasonal, or just plain silly). While the vanilla game might get boring after twenty or thirty hours, there are already mods, new assets, and maps to spice things up. Just like a real city, a REAL community, this game's replayability will be dependent upon community involvement. And I predict a lot of brilliant mods and patches to come.There's something really special about C:S and I can't quite put my finger on it. It's like waking up on DESIGNATED APPLICABLE HOLIDAY morning to a big present, and you unwrap it and it's one of those farm playsets, or when you're zooming toy cars along the roads of your city map rug, or admiring an elaborate diorama in a quiet museum.And then somewhere nearby a toilet explodes."
49,795.3,Recommended," April 5, 2016",15,"Did you play SimCity and you were disappointed by how fast the gameplay seemed to stall out? Did you not play city sims before, and you are looking for a good place to start? Either way this game is a brilliant choice for you. The content offering it provides is abselutely insane. Compared to the already mentioned SimCity, I would say you get 5x the game for 1/3 the price. After 450 hours of gameplay, I have never ""finished"" any city to the point where I could not expand any further. To top it all off, basically any annoying gameplay issue you encounter can be solved in 5 minutes of browsing the workshop.I will now get picky and point out the biggest weaknesses I have found during my hundreds of hours of playtime, but keep in mind that I would never play the game that much if I did not love it in it's current state.The DLC is not worth it. The DLC almost costs half of the game itself, and adds very little to the gameplay. After Dark mostly makes it very annoying to build half of the time, because it is, you know... dark at night. Apart from that the gameplay around the day/night cycle is not that appealing, to me at least. Snowfall would be worth if there was a season cycle, but you either have permanent snow, or no snow at all.If you think you might enjoy the game a quarter as much as I do, it's probably your best buy you ever made."

382,41.3,Recommended," March 19, 2015",12,"Another city building game, but it's not quite like the others. More on that later, first my list of pros and cons;PROS:- Water has current, which you have to plan for so as not to polute your own shores.- Water can controlled, both current and levels using hydro dams.- Citizens have specifically assigned residences (and jobs), making traffic more realistic.- The various interface overlays makes determining the placing of utility structures very easy.- You can practically do anything you want to when it comes to roads/highways/ramps.- Graphics are superb and performance is amazing, regardless of zoom level.- You get the feeling of SimCity, without the bad taste it left behind.- Completely customizable routes for buses, subways, and trains.- High number of road types for you to select, everything from gravel to highways.CONS:- Constant ""tweets"" got pretty annoying after a while.- Tweets about problems that shouldn't exist (ex. dead person, with a crematorium next door).- Building with full fire coverage would burn down and prompt you to check fire coverage.- Not enough options to deal with garbage and collection ranges seemed unrealistic.- A lot of specialty buildings had ""noise"" zones that seemed unreasonably large.- No real options to deal with industry polution, other than to keep it away from everything else.- Not enough random building names, I'd often find 6-8 buildings in a row with the same name.- Small number of maps included (although more are available).- No way (that I've found) to have a subway come to the surface.- No streetcars- Ships (cruise/cargo) movement seemed extremely unrealistic, as if it was an afterthought.- Music is EXTREMELY repetative, I had to turn it off after a while.- Road ""snapping"" can be annoying when working on highway offramps, even when it's supposedly turned off.Now that I've given you that basic list, let's get down to brass tax. Everyone is correct when they say that this game is everything that SimCity should have been. That said, it is lacking in a few basics that SimCity actually had. The biggest thing in my list of pet peves for this game would have to be garbage collection. In my 80,000 population city (real life) there is one garbage dump and the entire city's garbage has been going there since the city was built. In this game, by the time my population was 10,000 I had 4 garbage dumps spread out across the landscape. By the time I hit 80,000 there was an entire district devoted to garbage dumps (10 of them) with 6 insinerators trying (unsuccessfully) to keep them from being full. I even had the recycling policy in place, and still my garbage dumps were overflowing. Oh, that's another thing, no recycling centers?Anyway, when you put this game beside SimCity there really isn't any question that Cities: Skylines is the superior game overall. It does have it's issues, but it's by far the best all around city building game that's been produced. Don't go into this game expecting your every city building dream to come true, just enjoy it for what it is.EDIT:Since the addition of the Workshop to Cities:Skylines most of the problems I mentioned are easily solved by downloading 3rd party workshop items, like a recycling center. This game is now my #1 city building game."

64,82.6,Recommended," October 13, 2016",12,"Cities: Skylines, is perhaps the ultimate city building game, a must have for Steam, and should absolutely be the first city builder someone plays. First off, let me dispell some worries you may have, I know I had some. This game has MASSIVE maps, you unlock them piece by piece as your city grows, HOWEVER, you will only be able to have a total of 9 tiles, so plan out your city according to that. (9 Tiles is still huge, dont get the wrong idea)Skylines is also a VERY easy game to get into. My chief concern about this game was that it would be more learning HOW TO play, instead of actually playing, and wheres the fun in that? Fortunately, Skylines is easy to understand and master.*The biggest reason why you should buy Skylines is mod support. These range from buildings, cars, and all sorts of things. What makes this feature even better is that some buildings created in workshop have requirements that need to be met before they can be constructed (These requirements are chosen by the person who made it in workshop), which can potentially add more to the game.TL;DR: If youre looking for the pinnacle of city builder games, and/or a city builder thats easy and simple to understand, you should buy it."
141,337.6,Recommended," June 21, 2015",9,"One of the best city building games of all time in my opinion. I've gotten more time out of this than Simcity as a whole (in the same span of time) and I still love it. Great workshop compatibility, graphics, and mechanics. Some things could definitely be improved but I feel like the workshop is already on all of that. WAY better than any other equivalent. Also, I can't believe this game is made in Unity! Doesn't run that well on larger cities but is still runs better than any other city builder. It actually simulates everthing, the roads are way better, huge maps, resources, much better traffic AI than other games (not to say that you can just draw grids everywhere and not expect traffic, you still have to use a 6-4-2 method). Roads tools are great and fun and aesthatically appealing."

With mods, the game becomes the best city building game ever made, by far (at least if you're like me and are looking more to create a pretty and atmospheric city rather than enjoy deep management and simulation gameplay).A massive catalogue of cosmetic mods (both for adding new assets and tweaking the graphics) and robust asset editing combined with utility mods like Prop Anarchy and MoveIt makes it possible to have everything looking just how you want it. I treat this game as more of a canvas to paint on than a game to play.Colossal Order have released several free updates to fix bugs and have been generally good at listening to the playerbase. My personal biggest complaint, the traffic AI, hasn't been fixed although there is talk of changing it in the future.The base game goes on sale regularly and a large majority of the mods don't require any DLC, so it's been good value for me.If you're looking to interact deeply with your citizens, scheme political and diplomatic schemes and solve complex civil engineering problems, you might find this game lacking.

423,"1,494.3",Recommended," May 10, 2015",31,"Over 300 hours enough said ALL PROBLEMS I LIST ARE FIXED BY MODSDue to the new as of 7/11/17 mass transportion dlc a lot of the traffic issues I list are voided. ""Slightly"" Cars will plie up because the random cars not owned by people in the city are trying to use your city highway system as a short cut between highways connection: A and highway connection:B So you have either HAVE to make a bypass for those cars or your highways will be clogged. The new dlc does add more details to the cites transportation information screens. However not enough for example I recently started to use a lot of underground passages to make people have easy connection to schools or medical buildings. I see the many homes that people leave to use these tunnles but I do not know *HOW* many people are using them.Nighttime is nice. But the speciality of areas to section into your city seem lacking. However my biggest issue is no shock here. Taxis. I thought the taxis would work like buses jut spawning the needed amount for the area or route. Nope Taxis are a limited number. Making them nothing but flash for your roads and never making the expense money back. It seems that with more they add to the game the more the games traffic isses become more bothersome. Yes I can fix it with mods. However, I say I shouldnt have to. Because this game was made by the same dev that made City in motion. So clearly they have an understanding of what a city needs to run. However, they seem to have cut that out in this as in transport that has diffrent type of mass transport and effectivness in this game. The game seems to be designed for a road/highway based city. And any other methods bedamed. Which I personally find very not upset just wishing it was better. Tunnels add a new useful way to manage roads/highways. However the tunnels are not labeled so over time underground ends up looking like the L.A. freeways system but underground.Further there is not enough detailed information. Industry will complain about not having enough resources. However there is no way to just add the import costs to the city expenses. Which is very confusing because there are city view overlays that show trucks driving to industry with imports. It seems that over time the industries are not able to order more imports. This problem also effects office/commercial these sectors also lose the ability to get the goods needed to function. Moreover, If you connect industry to office/comm industry for a time sends the needed goods to the formerly mentioned sectors. Alas the mentioned issues mean that after a time the problems kick in so massive amounts of these sectors are abandoned. So you will have to delete large sections of those sectors. Moving on to transport it works by placing lines in the path you want it to go and press the line to place the stop. That is how the game explains it to you however that it is very messy to place many lines on bus and trains/subway. Traffic is another big problem. And can not be fixed without placing messy lines of highway making your city look like the L.A. freeway system. Oh and the cars on the highway drive like♥♥♥♥♥♥cutting each other off and slowing down the other cars in the lanes. No matter how many subways or buses or trains I place in hotspots. People still use their cars. After playing the game for another 100+ hours my traffic controling skills are better so after about 90,000 people in my city THEN the trafic goes to poop. However this game is not marketed as a grand city builder just a basic one. So it shouldnt have taken me and extra 100 hours to get a handle on the traffic and mass transport. Moding is highly easy for this game I still find myself using very little ""big"" mods other than road intersections and what not because heavy mods make my game crash."

This game does everything other games of the genere haven't, a million times better than Sim City of 2013. The traffic simulation is top notch, there are so many choices for roads, like the ability to build your own highways! There is a load of unique buildings, many transportation options, and so much more. Anything you want in a city builder this game has it! However, it is also a challenge, you wont have incredible city very quickly. A lot of issues can hit you hard while your population expands, my only complaint is that you need many, many, many, service buildings to cover a very large city, To much in my mind, I hope they tweak that because it can really drain your income. Again, though this game is fun, creative, innovative, challenging, and above all a great city builder. You will not regret picking this one up, atm it is the 2015 Game of the Year!"

The usage of plural noun, in this case 'cities' instead of 'city' really lives up its name. Literally, the available space is big enough to make multiple cities.

320,118.4,Recommended," May 26, 2015",11,"This is a fantastic city building game, but if you are looking for the ability to drive around your city as shown in Sim City 3 and up, not quite it. I'm also going to give you a warning that this game may eat away at your hours.Reading over the reviews, I've seen this game a multitude of times compared to Sim City. The biggest comparison I see is that, this game has been labelled ""easier"". In some sense it's true, but when you realize how big your city can be and the unique styles you can give to your roads, it can get complicated. The game is about building up a city, but eventually turns into managing one instead of it managing itself.The gameplay is relatively simple. Everything is laid out for you, and as your city grows, so does your ability to build upgraded or newer buildings. Taxes can be adjusted, budgets can be adjusted (for parks, buses, water works, electricity etc...), and loans can be taken out. Even if you are not extremely familiar how economics work in a municipality, the game does it's best to advise you of everything going on. Placing police stations, fire stations, hospitals, or even schools becomes very easy as the game does an extremely good job in showing which areas are covered. What can drive a few people nuts is putting water pumps near sewage dumps. At first, you may smile as you see water is being delivered to your residents and that the sewage water is far away (especially in the first level with the lake). You'll then notice a lot of water being polluted and eventually making it's way up to your water pumps.It is imperative that my readers know to build down stream or to use water towers where sewage may be an issue! They also make it easy to see what crime rates are (check the top left of your screen), what your citizens happiness is, pollution, electricity and water availability, natural resources and a few others. The biggest feature in the game to me it seems, is the ability to really architect the roads. In Sim City, you are able to put zones wherever you please. In Skylines, you have only the choice to build near roads. Zoning is made easy and can be done with a fill brush tool or individual squares can be assigned. A huge feature in Skylines is districts. Districts are designed by you and are designated by you as well. Want a forest industry? Want a mining industry? Want a farming industry by residential areas? This can be done through districts. Definitely a notable feature in the game. Bus stops and other sort of transport is available. They try to give you as much control as possible within the game. Bus stops are designated by you and are placed where you'd like them to be. At first it is difficult to control where the bus goes when placing the stops, but choosing the RIGHT side of the road is important for it to work properly!are appropriate. The music is neither condemning or over the top, but the repitid Sounds follow your screen, and you will hear buildings burn if they are on fire. At first glance, I thought traffic was extremely horrible in my city. I zoomed in closer and saw they actually park their cars in front of their house. Good to see the attention to detail put in.I bought this game on sale and am quite content with the product. I would like to have a feature where I can drive through my city or even go on a rampage with a truck. Maybe it's asking too much from a city builder, but having complete control like this is what differentiates the best from the rest.RATING : 7.5/10"

20,350.1,Recommended," March 10, 2015",11,"Ever since simcity-4, city simulation has become more off a hobby for me than just occasional game play. Over the years I have created many custom buildings (mainly Paris and medieval themes) and mods (amongst other the Jupiter (weather) and the Aurora mods) for simcity-4. Simcity 2013 was a major disappointment on all accounts.I have been fortunate to have been invited to test Cities Skylines' modding tools during the beta phase for the past couple of months. And during that time I have also been able to play the game. Cities Skylines exceeds my expectations. The potential that can be unlocked by the community and by DLCs provided by CO is unbelievable. I am absolutely overwhelmed by how great this game is.Additionally, I have gained the utmost respect for CO. It is unbelievable what a small team of creative people can do. Aside from developing a fantastic game, CO actually listens to the community to the best of their abilities.Bound by an NDA, it has been challenging for me not being able to respond to all the comments, questions, critisicm, (sometimes unjust) speculation on the forums. And I kept thinking if only you could get to play the game for half an hour and - like me - become captivated by studying the little CIMS in their daily routine, or laying out the most amazing road interchanges. Finally a game I can enjoy again without having to shoot someone.Off course some I do share some of the criticism that also has been shared on the forums. I could even create a list of a dozen or more features that I would like to see changed or improved. But all that is driven by my enthusiasm for this game, and there is a time a place for everything. So for now I am just giving this game a 10/10."

72,48.7,Not Recommended," October 21, 2017",253,"Same as most others, I am disappointed by the publisher, Paradox's (not the developer, Colossal Order, like I previously implied) choice to release DLC packs for what really should have been updates or even included with the base game at launch. To top it off, the DLC is priced on the high end comparitive to what you get for each one.Really... Disasters are a paid-for DLC? Are you kidding me? I got disasters included with SimCity way back 25 years ago.This is not a new concept that should be additional paid-for DLC.The game could have been awesome - and even fitting to have valuable paid-for DLC worth purchasing - however, the way they stripped out so many basic features in favor of offering these at an additional premium really leaves a bad impression."
198,122.4,Recommended," March 14, 2015",8,"This game is worth its money threefold.Remember SimCity 2013?Yeah you probably do because it was chockfull of bugs and annoyances, however you still enoyed it didn't you?I had the same.Some of those annoyances weren't small however. The maximum land size was one of them. A measly 2x2 KM block of land was ALL you could get in SimCity 2013.Now you might ask why do I bring up SimCity? Because, obviously, this game is a lot like SimCity (who would have guessed!) except it doesn't have its flaws.This game is, in my eyes, by far the best city builder since Simcity 4.One of the biggest issues with Simcity 2013 was the plot size. Well guess what, this game can be 8 times larger at the very least and 24 times larger with a simple mod!That's also part of the exquisite beauty of this game; mods. This game fully suppors modding if you didn't figure it out already. There's already several thousands mods on the Workshop, and that number is expanding by the hour!Another big issue in this game was traffic, even though traffic behaves mostly the same, from what I've seen/played/heard/read the traffic is much more manageable in here, simply because you can expand your cities, easily upgrade your roads and build intricate intersections, overpasses and so forth.Something new this game has is called 'Districts'. Districts carry a load of potential, as they can specialise your chosen area to a certain type of Industry, limit your density of Residential, Industry or Commercial Zones and put certain Policies per District.It is quite a bit slower than Simcity 2013 though, don't expect to hit 400.000 citizens within 5 or 6 hours, your city builds up slowly.One of the main complaints I've seen is that cities seem much more populated than the civ number, this is because the civ number shown is the actual number of simulated agents. The actual people you might see is probably quite a bit higher.I have no idea whether or not this review makes a lot of sense to you, but if it does, be sure to check this great and time-consuming game out because DAMN is it awesome."

65,126.7,Recommended," June 29, 2017",34,"PROS:- Huge maps. I mean giant.- Since the update, mass transit has become much better to use, with more options available to fine tune your city- No lag in the early half of the game. (If you unlock all the map and then start filling it, you will get lag, but if you play on a slightly smaller scale you'll be fine.- Good taxing, budget and policy systems- The mods make this game what it is!CONS:- DLC is fairly overpriced for what it actually brings to the game.- If you play the game modless, traffic management can be a pain, e.g. you cant create junctions with no left/right turns for example. This can be fixed by using the Traffic Manager: President Edition mod.- No tutorial at the beginning of the game. I tried to explain how to get started to my friend and I resorted to YouTube in the end. It's a learning curve for sure.- Electricty and water distribution is a bit meh.- Land value is only based upon how many parks and plazas you place in an area."

543,119.9,Recommended," July 2, 2015",8,"Cities: SkylinesCities: Skylines turned out a game better than what I imagined to be. At the time I got this game, which as some time ago, I was a Simcity fan, well I still am. Not as much since the disaster of Simcity 2015. I was intrigued when I saw Cities: Skylines, I saw good potential. I took the risk of buying it, not doing much research about it, sure enough, I picked the right game.Cities: Skylines is basically Simcity, but even better. You can put in so much detail in your cities. Managing traffic without any care will also lead yourself into bigger problems than what Simcity would do, well for me at least.You have your modes such as the original, you have to manage your money, and have to be smart on your spendings to make the income to keep yourself afloat. Then you have The Sandbox, which is the only one I play, to be honest. You don't have to worry about anything, really. Well, your city of course, but money isn't much of an issue.You have your utilities to supply your city. Such as Water, Electricity, and Sewage and so on.You place down your zones, such as Low-Residental, High-Residental, Commerical, Business, and Industry.You have your transportation, although not all are included, as yes, DLC's. But the DLC's are kind of worth it, I'll explain more about this later. Anyways, you have your Subway System, Train System, Airplanes, and Buses.You supply happiness to your city, placing their wants and needs. Build a park to make your city look more beautiful, put in school systems so your citizens actually have a good education for better jobs.The Downloadable content for this game is actually pretty good, although some are bad in my opinion. But these DLC' add's more to your games. The DLC's I would focus on getting first would be these:Each of these DLC's will add more to your game. For example, with After Dark, you'll be able to add some nightlife in your city, or with Mass Transit you'll have better transportation.It's good and bad for the DLC's, you just have to pay more to experience more, but in a way, it's sort of worth it if you're dedicated to playing this game. I'll likely review these, later on, in the meantime, I don't have any of them reviewed.Oh yes, there is indeed Mod Support. a very good amount too. It's also easy to use them also because all you need is the Steam Workshop!You can have some enhanced mods, such as AI improvements, buildings, and more! Just also note, some DLC's are required for some mods. Usually, the creators will give out the requirements needed for the mod, but other than that you should be okay.Steam Workshop Link:If you want a good city building of a game, Cities: Skylines is a perfect pick for you 101%! There's so much you can do in this game for a city builder, more than what Simcity had in the past. Using mods is although risky, but it really, really enhances your game so much more.On a final rating of a scale 1/10, I would give this game a 9.4/10!"

The modding capabilities, districting, road laying mechanics and the large city sizes are some of the big plusses in my book.

(DLC, DRM) It does takes quite a bit aspects from SimCity 2013 though (honestly a scary amount) but thankfully leaves all of the bad ones out.With regards to how it compares to SimCity 4 though, I'd say SC4 is still superior but just barely. Cities: Skylines offers a more simpler and easier yet less balanced economic system than SC4 did, which isn't necessarily a good thing. SC4 also had better information screens, the ability to modify landscape in-game, and doesn't have this questionable building unlocking progression. Also, I need to mention the lack of 'God' controls and commands such as disasters that SimCity 4 did have.But thankfully, the game has just been released and the dev team will continue to make updates for months maybe years to come and the modding community for this game is already phenomenal.Graphics: 8.5/10Audio: 8.5/10Gameplay/Replay-ability: 9.25/10Interface: 8.75Traffic/Simulation: 9.25/10Mod Support: 9.5/10Overall, I give this game a 9/10."

I love this game; it’s a little bit more flexible than most city builders out there. But, Its dumb how overpriced the DLC content is and how little it brings to the game. From the release of this game I’ve seen constant praise for (not really so much the game) the developer of Cities Skyline, I have to wonder what's going on? If a company like EA did something like this to their game (which they have) people would be screaming bloody murder.To be honest I kinda get it, good developers are hard to come by. But a company that gives you one new building for $15 is not a good company. That’s a company that is trying to imitate the most hated company in America, EA.Now don't get me wrong, the game is incredibly fun, but with all the overpriced DLC the game has out right now if you refuse to buy any of it like me, you will end up missing out on a lot of important game changing features. They need to combine all the DLC they have, and release it with a 10-15 dollar price tag. The game is not worth all the money you need to put into it for so little content. That's why I can't recommend it right now.It's funny to me how the new Sim City did this and died a horrible death. But only recently have people started to catch on to this developer and see just how much they are milking their EXTREMELY loyal fan base. I hate to see it. I hope they correct the situation soon."

It looks great, runs well, and does a great job in offering a variety of transit and building options. The lacking aspects beyond some more services (such as libraries or museums from SC2K for example), are mostly in the fine details, as creating transit lines can get quite finicky, and having to manually demolish abandoned building becomes a chore with a large city. Nonetheless a new paragon in it's genre; Skylines is the new benchmark, the one to beat when it comes to city-building."

153,25.2,Not Recommended," February 8, 2017",302,"TL;DR: sandbox game for creative players. If your creativity is channeled through problem-solving, then this game will leave you wanting.I have tried so hard to like the game.Hands-down, technically the best city-builder since Sim City 4. The problem is: I don't have the urge to come back to it. 5 hours in, lack of interest settles in, I just give up and start over. Rince and repeat. I can't find the fun though I'm looking hard.Therefore it's aimed at players, who just play on unlimited resources and invest time in designing a beautiful city.Lack of challenge makes you fail to see the point of anything after a couple hours. ""Ok, I can improve traffic, but what's the point, people still come to my city and budget is fine anyway"". ""Criminality? Okay, whatever. Budget's fine"".""Cool, I can fine tune the budget with all the sliders!... I can make tax-free zones for specific industries!... but I don't care and won't ever use it because there's absolutely no point"".If you're the kind of person who just wants to design stuff, then you'll have a blast. If you channel your creativity through problem-solving, then boredom will settle in quickly.If you're anything like me, then you will find that there's no point in moving away from the ""grid"" city-design. Every block is a square, crossroads are crosses, because that's the more efficient choice. So if you're a problem solver, all your cities will look the same.That may sound stupid to Americans, but here in old Europe, cities have grown organically over the course of millenias: cars are barely allowed in medieval city centers, which have tons of pedestrians-only walkways; low-rent flats are usually in the cities' outskirts; then, further away, the big business center with highrises, accessible by road or public transportation, built in a very windy spot or on an old marsh, because that's the only spot where our ancestors didn't build anything...I dream of the day a city-builder will have us build a city through the ages. Imagine the challenges! Your 1200 AD city needs wall for defense, but cannons will soon render this useless and you'll be left with crumbling walls dividing your city between center and outskirts.

Then, fast-forward 2010, there is so much traffic that you need to reshape everything around cycling and public transportation...You could choose to start in the New World around 1600 AD, where challenges are entirely different...If you built your city originally on a marsh, or trapped between mountains, or in windy plains, then you would have different challenges and opportunities, renewed every new era.Now, THAT would keep me playing till 4am.

Gameplay wise; it is a sandbox in which you are able to realize your greatest City desires, seriously the creative of the community is so unreal.Once you're done with the base game, you can move onto the DLCs, whilst i don't own them personally, i have played them and found them to be super enjoyable. However they are not neccessary because you still get alot for your money's worth.Beware this game consumes alot of time, its so enjoyable and 1 hour feels like 10 minutes."

40,175.6,Not Recommended, February 9,96,"I've put 160 hours into this game. My max population I ever got to was over 70,000. Ive done it a couple of times, but i always restart because i'm trying to discover a solution to a HUGE problem in this game.The problem is traffic. The AI in this game are programmed horribly. They will always take the shortest route to their destination. Instead, they need to be programmed to take the fastest route to their destination.For example, lets say most of the AI turn right at a certain intersection. I put a 3 lane road there so that they can have two right turns. (I need to add here that there is no function in the game that allows you to specify which lane goes where. You have to install a mod for that). I allow the AI to use the first and second lanes for right turns. 99% of the cars will use the first lane & 1% of the cars will use the second lane. This is because they are programmed to take the shortest route to their destination. Because of this, you will have 100 cars in one of the lanes and 1 car in the other lane. This is illogical. Instead, they need to program the AI to go for the FASTEST route.Here's another example. You have a three lane road that eventually hits an intersection. Going straight at the intersection takes the AI cars to a suburb area but turning right takes the AI to the shops. 99% of the AI will be turning right, so they will all drive in the far right lane even if they are 50 miles away from the intersection. locigal humans don't do this, so it creates traffic problems you wouldn't realistically have in a simulation.A final problem i've found with this game is the death waves. You have to be careful to allow building of houses 1 little plot at a time. If you allow the development of a huge plot of land, for example, all the AI will move in at the same time. Then, they will NEVER MOVE OUT until they die. I think someone estimated each AI has a life span of like 18 years, so after 18 years in game time, suddenly the whole neighborhood will die of old age. You will experience what the community calls ""Death waves' and it will make the game painful once your population gets to be about 40,000.These two things are game breaking in my opinion."
94,23.4,Recommended," March 12, 2015",7,"I've never felt the need to review a game before, as I tend to play casually and don't really have much to add, but given the enjoyment I'm getting from this game I felt I needed to review.The game, for me, is simply what the SimCity series should have evolved into - it's intuitive, whilst still requiring brain power to plan your city (everything from where the buses stop, tax rates and budget, right down to putting trees next to roads to reduce noise pollution) - the biggest selling point however is the available real estate to build on, which I feel has been sorely lacking in recent city building games. You start with a fairly decent sized square of land and can expand this out into a sprawling metropolis - giving you the satisfaction of seeing your efforts bloom into a real ""city"" rather than just an increasily busy, small square.Others have covered far more in-depth than I have - but from my point of view, as a casual player who likes to dip and out of the game, slowly building up a city that I can see previous efforts and decisions continue to impact, the game is an absolute winner.Highly recommend it!"
221,82.5,Recommended," November 30, 2016",7,"City Skylines is what Sim City 4 should have been. Paradox has done a great job on this guy and continues to support it with DLC and new features. If you like city builders this game will ruin evey other one for you by setting the new gold standard, What few beefs I have with the game are easily remedied by mods which the creators fully endorse and a slew of mod authors with materials, for example not being able to unlock every tile on the map, not sure why they restricted that, performace maybe, but there is a mod for that. With the exceptioon of multi player (not a feature I look for in city builders) I can't think of a single feature missing at this point assuming you have all the DLC.Graphically it is pretty good, not going to win awards but still one of the if not the best looking city builder I have played. Able to controll traffic routs above and below ground if you wish. I honestly cannot think of too many bad things to say about this game, If I was to bring up one point of contention I do think the crime is unrealistically low, but it hasn't annoyed me to the point of finding a mod to fix it.

714,39.0,Recommended," March 13, 2015",7,"I really wish there was a neutral, or recommend with reservations choice for reviews.Cities: Skylines is promising, but I'm not totally enamored with it. I feel bad for saying this because the people at Paradox Interactive seem like a cool group of people. I'm pleased it has done so well for them in such a short period of time. I hope it leads to further improvements! CO seems interested in gathering feedback on the forums.Skylines does many things right - ease of road construction, traffic modeling, and the city builder basics. By far the aspect I enjoyed most was building roads and watching the traffic. I don't get into the creative aspect of city building, so my contentment comes from overcoming challenges provided by a detailed simulation. I need to feel like traffic problems matter more than they do in Skylines. People should be mad when traffic prevents them from arriving at their destination. Businesses should shut down if their workers never arrive. I didn't really have money issues, which maybe would be solved by using the hard mode mod. It is a pretty beginner-friendly game, so don't expect a great challenge out of the box.I think creative types would get more out of the game then I do, and beginners to the genre are given a warm fuzzy hug. My negative comments aside, I do think it is the best of the 'traditional' city builder type of games - the new SimCity and Cities XL. It's also kept my interest longer than Banished due to the interesting road building in Skylines. By their nature, city builders can get repetitive and I don't have a high tolerance for that.I hope the game gets a lot of post release support, and Paradox has a great track record when it comes to that. Maybe after some updates my opinion will be a little more positive. My with more details is available."

39,4.3,Recommended," September 28, 2016",7,"Cities: Skylines is a city builder developed by Colossal Order, the guys who were responsible for making the Cities in Motion series, and published by Paradox Interactive, and I have to say this is hands down the best city builder we’ve ever had on Steam .The size of the game is astonishing, by default the game features a 36km^2 map which is almost ten times the size of the map we’re given in SimCity 2013, and with the help of mods from the Steam Workshop, this can be expanded to a mind boggling 100km^2. Even though there are no interactions between cities that are on different maps, it is frankly not necessary, with the help of the powerful yet easy to use building tool, you can build multiple cities on a single map.Despite its humongous size, the developers paid close attention to details, in fact, detail is the word I’ll use to describe this game. From the entire traffic network, down to individual citizens, every aspect in Cities: Skylines are properly simulated. You’ll find lorries, colour coded depending on what they are currently carrying, delivering their cargoes to their designated factories, citizen actually living in a permanent home, and ambulances rushing to accident scenes, then little paramedics will get out of their vehicle, and few seconds later return with a patient on a stretcher.I also love how water works in this game as well as the fluid physics, it is completely unnecessary to have it in a city builder but in this case it has added so much more to the experience. Water has currents and flows, so you'll want to pump water on the upstream and set up sewage pipes on the opposite end, else you’ll start pumping polluted sewage water back into the system. You can even drain a lake dry completely, or accidentally flooding your city because you demolished a dam, playing with water has never been so fun.This is a city builder perfected, and with the support of Steam Workshop, further enriched by the endless creativity of the community. Cities: Skylines is a must buy for anyone who has the slightest interest in city builders."

You can say that this game is community called Sim City 5, because this is more of Sim City that Sim City 2013. It playes well, it runs well, maps are huge and expandable, it's sometimes hard, but as soon as you get used to it- you're good to go. Yet it lacks some non critical stuff, like terraforming in Mayor mode and day and night cycle. I really desire to see those implemented in future updates if that is even possible. Everything else is a mix of SimCity 1 and 4 with tons of cool additions, like districts, resource system, sound pollution, few new services, it's a great mix i must admit.

142,14.9,Recommended, February 13,9,"Never thought such simulator can be so exciting. I tried it for 20 minutes and couldn't stop playing after that.The biggest challenge is city traffic. I didn't have problems with anything except traffic. Traffic dictates what you do in your city: not only you improve your roads but also re-arrange your industrial and business areas.Cons of the game:- auto saves are turned off by default. I lost abut 2 hours of work(game progress) because of game crash.- auto saves when enabled only create one save file. Devs could learn from Factorio.- in-game twitter spams the same messages over and over and becomes annoying fairly fast. But that's a fun feature for beginners- doing curved roads is a pain. When I try to create a curved path from my city street to a highway it is so ugly.- Not enough in-game info on some problems. For example in late game my new industrial areas have no workers for them, but there is enough of residential area around. Forums help. Also the ""Not enough city services"" warning isn't helpful, I still don't know why it happens and how to fix.- It is not clear why vehicles on a 3-lane highway only use the middle lane and pile in a long traffic jam.- Lots of things in the late game need to be investigated on forums, there's not enough info in the game itself, and you wont be able to figure it out by yourself.Some lulz:- To unlock some government building I had to reach ""Average garbage piling of 40 per household"" milestone so I turned off all garbage trucks. That was a huge challenge for my city. Almost devasted it. Population size dropped by 2 times, lots of bancrupted buildings.- To unlock theater building I need to fully fill 5 cemeteries. And I figured this out when I had not a single cemetery but crematoriums all over the city."

With all the mods and assets (for free, by the way) on Workshop for this game, the DLC's are not at all necessary. I've been playing this game for years now (2,496 hours at the time of this review) and have never been bored once. And the only DLC I ever bought was AFTER DARK …. only because it gave me bicycle lanes. I've felt no desire to purchase the Disasters or the Mass Transit DLCs, even if they were dropped to $1.00 each ….. okay, maybe the Mass Transit one if only $1.00.But I've gotten off-track of my point, which is that with all the mods and assets that are free for this game, you don't really need the DLCs.If you just subscribe (it's free) to the First Person Mod by Tony56a, you can have days and weeks of fun just traveling around in your city. As a Cim yourself or just riding along in a vehicle or a Cim wherever they go. The game is COMPLETEY DIFFERENT – and sooo much fun – once you jump down into it and actually look at it from ground level.Frustrated with creating a city? Don't bother to create one --- on the Workshop, you can subscribe to a city of your choice (again, for free) that is already all set up for you, mods and assets, roads, city services, and all, and immediately start playing about down in the city as a CIM yourself. Or you can start from there (with all the frustrating work of setting things up) already done for you. From that point you can play with what you subscribed to or start adding in or removing anything you like from the city.Anyone who hasn't tried this game is cheating himself/herself of one of the most fascinating experiences ever …. and I gotta tell ya, NO ONE could get me to play ANY computer games before I was forced by a family member to sit down in front of this one for one hour and play it. Now I'm hooked and spend almost all my spare winter season hours on it … and, to my shame, some of my summer gardening hours as well.And, honestly, for a vacation into a world you can make into your very own, the initial price is more than worth it. If I lost it and had to start over and buy it again, I'd actually be willing to save up till I had $60.00 US and buy it again, if that was what it cost then. And really, all anyone ever really has to pay for is the initial game, regardless of what the naysayers are whining about."

1,4.8,Recommended," March 10, 2015",51,"[Disclosure: This was reviewed due to a review copy provided by Paradox]After 2013’s debacle that was Sim City it was time some new devs stepped to the table. Cities XXL was a huge miss as Focus Interactive did nothing to improve their terrible running and clunky game so the question is, did Colossal Order (a Paradox dev responsible for Cities in Motion) deliver? Yes, oh my god Yes!Cities Skylines is another game in the long list of city building and managing simulators that have been trying to succeed in the shoes of what was Sim City 4; released more than 12 years ago. From the dev that created Cities in Motion, Colossal Order does something that no other city sim has done and make a truly great game that brings back the feel of Sim City 4 and my favorite of the series, Sim City 3000. They brought it back to its basics which included zones, different building types like electrical, water, fire, police, medical, fun and even the unique landmark buildings.When you start creating your city you start in a small 2km x 2km square that can expand as your city gets bigger and you annex other areas to a possible 25 tile, 100km2 area (with the support of a mod that is already in the steam workshop). The game also locks different building, zones, etc. behind population goals so that it isn’t too overwhelming however there are mods that allow you to unlock everything to start if you wish along with unlimited money. The game will also allow for steam workshop when it releases for people to create their own user content to add to the game which could include more buildings, new modes, user made cities and much more.Along with the buildings and zones there are also the financial and policies that make a city sim a true city sim. They are simple enough and not as annoying as was the advisors in sim city 3000 but they change things greatly including outlawing private traffic in certain zones forcing people to take mass transit instead. What those policies and other specific buildings do is increase the happiness of the people in the commercial, residential and industrial zones. As your happiness increases they are more likely to accept higher taxes and recommend more people to move in causing an increase in desire for residential and other financial zones. I can also say that Colossal Order certainly know how to make their transport lines work and work well because every form of transportation was easy to create and maintain.That being said the roads themselves were difficult to make sure they were right especially having off ramps connect to highways. When I bought my first annex there was a highway running through it. I thought it would have been easy enough to figure out how to implement a overpass/rounded off ramp to have access to the other side of the highway however I had to do a lot of work to get a new one working. First I had to delete the existing off ramps and highway to make way for a 4 way off ramp. On top of that in order to make sure a one way road/highway continues to go one way, instead of detecting which way automatically the roads go you to build the road in the same direction traffic would flow. Took me about 15 minutes to realize this. Hopefully it’ll be something they patch after release because I can imagine it’ll be something some people will complain about.One other complaint, and maybe it is something I’m not used to due to the simplicity of zones in Sim City 3000, I don’t like the way zones sit for “squares” off the road for each road you make. I’m more of a fan of dragging and dropping to make a zone like it was in SC 3000. That is just a personal preference. However all you can do with the roads is quite impressive and though I did play this game quite a bit I wasn’t able to play it enough to truly design a city that looked great.Now this game looks quite impressive and the buildings are quite varied enough to make the cities and areas look unique. Mod support and steam workshop is only going to improve the variety of buildings after release. The engine runs smooth, however capped at 60 fps (not that you really need more since this isn’t a action moving game), and looks great. The UI is clean and they actually made a change to it as I was playing my review copy in the last week.The sound isn’t anything spectacular, however it is there and does work well with what the game is. If you zoom in to roads you can hear cars going by, if you do the same for various areas you hear what you would expect to hear if you were walking on the street. The ambient music also makes it nice to listen to while you are designing away. So nothing over the top but fits quite well.Overall, Cities Skylines, I feel, is truly the best city sim game since Sim City 4 and in fact is better than 4. It has everything that you could want in a city building game; large building areas, variety in design and buildings, unique challenges in building and managing and a great looking engine. This is a must in my opinion for anyone that was looking for the next good city builder especially those that like to play in offline mode.Review with screenshots:"

Little details like the water backing up behind a dam, swaying electricity wires etc make this game look fantastic. It's everything that SimCity should've been and more.The towns look small when you first start, but be rest assured you can grow a city up to 6x6km in a Prison Architect style land purchasing method. This is pretty much rivalling Cities XL in terms of raw city size.Overall, 10/10"
398,34.1,Recommended," March 13, 2015",20,"Everthing about this city builder functions perfectly as you'd expect and more. For instance, one thing speaks to how much thought has and may continue to be put into this game: the ability to close off a body of water with a dam, build pumps in it, and drain it. A short while after draining the body of water, grass soon grows on what was once dirt and you can plop down more city. You can even put sewage pumps along that area beforehand, remove the water pumps before turning them on, and flood your new stretch of city with poop water. If you really hate your citizens, you can place new water pumps in the ruins of your new-ish poop-flooded part of the city and your citizens all throughout your city will become poisoined and die.Sure most of that has little to do with the whole city building thing most of the time but it tells me everything I need to know about their dedication to detail and sandbox mechanics."

353,57.2,Recommended," March 20, 2016",13,"City building, one of the great monuments of mankind. Isn't the blatent repurposing of the earth's bounty for our mundane consumption and shelter the epitomy what it means to be human? Yes it is. And when you play Cities: Skylines you will come to appreciate the craftsmanship and skill involved in such an undertaking.It took me seven resets before I finally got a city running properly; and even then did I throw all my progress and work out the window just because it wasn't perfect enough. City building is strategy game in the truest form. It requires long term planning and foresight. Overlooking any aspect at the start can come back to haunt you later on. Like in my first city, everything was running smoothly until everyone fell ill from polluted drinking water. The tides from the coast weren't very good at disposing the sewage. So instead of fixing it, I decided to throw all that away and found a new city alongside a flowing river instead.With the water problem covered for now a new plague rose up. Power. I had to learn a few tricks from a pretty good youtuber to get the basics down; he showed you could start a city with a single wind tubine and save much more money for facilities. However, turbines are fickle and the wind is their enabler. As a result, it became a structural struggle to provide power for my budding metropolis. Once again, I threw the stuff away and started a new city, besides a river, on a hillside.At this point it should be clear that this game has a significant learning curve. You really need to invest and try stuff to get the hang of it. However, it does turn out to be rewarding, as your city vivibly evolves under your direction. It is welcoming to see a game so strong in visual feedback. A bustling city is more amusing to behold than a dying one, so it is an extra motivator to keep exploring and trying for new stuff.Now I'm in my 5th game and power and water are no longer a problem. The real challenge presents itself when you're expanding. Expanding is hard. You basically have to create a new city from scratch, and you effectively double your resource consumption in the process. Once again, your early choices make all the differences. Depending on how you positioned your first district in regards to the highway can make all the difference for the new stream of inhabitants and commuters. You'll have to consider traffic flows from a very early point to make them work in the long run. And that is how I began my 6th city.So after much trial and error, I am now running my 8th city and it is running like clockwork. I even have a booming oil and ore industry, as well as a modern office district and many options for easy living. At this point it helps to explore the extremely well crafted advisor windows. These intergrated menu screens can give you a direct glimpse into the affairs of your metropole. Fire safety, crimerate, congestion, pollution; it's all expertly depicted with easy to understand colour graphs and real time feedback from the system about current problems. The interface is such a marvel, I think more games could benefit from it.As your city grows, your scope zooms out and you move away from street corner politics and small scale renovations. Your footprint grows and so does your city. is possibly the best city building game ever made. Thanks to its direct feedback from the real time game, excellent interface and amazing graphics, it is a game worth building a city in, and then to wish you could one day live in it.Granted that you don't mess up at the start because no one wants to live in highway congestion. Punishing at the start. It certainly rewards the intrepid frontier's men/women."

This game captures the essence of what has been missing in the genre since the days of SimCity 4 (though 3000 has always been my favorite). The districting tool is fantastic and adds a new element that really makes your city yours. The city details are every bit as good as SimCity 5, but the game is smooth as silk, and the maps are far larger and even more visually appealing. No stupid patches every time I log in or online always requirements here. I cannot wait to see what the community is going to create for this game. The only negative I see is that sometimes there are mismatches between building names and what they look like (e.g. a laminate floor factory is named ""Burger World"" etc.). The interfaces are intuitive and slick, and the city progression will keep any gamer interested in pursuing city growth to higher and higher limits for days if not weeks. Nice work here all around.

It's such a smooth game to play. It runs like a throughly tested, well polished game. The vibrant colors and excellent soundtrack in the game instantly puts me in the mood to build my dream city. The game tools provides one with an abundance of creativity. So much so that I felt overwhelmed with all that I am able to do. I'm only limited by my imagination not the game mechanics which is awesome! Some of my favorite aspects of the game is the simulated people, yes folks each little pixlated person is an indivisual in City Skylines! I love the water dynamics and how they can create a challenge which adds to gameplay and not take away from it. I love all of the transportation options with more types promised in the future. I love the soundtrack and if I had only one regret, it was not getting in on that pre-order offer to get it. But what I love most, is the potential of this game through the modding community. This game is built with modding in mind. Can you imaging the many props and gameplay mods that will flow from the talented modders for this game? I can hardly wait, and guess what? The modders are already making assets and gamemods for Cities as you read this. I honestly can't praise this game enough. If you are interested in City Builders and you've been burned by other games, look no further. Cities will most likely satisfy everything you've ever wanted in a city builder game.

302,24.8,Recommended," April 9, 2016",10,"I was an avid fan of the SimCity franchise all the way back to SimCity on SNES when Will Wright was the developer. I had my pet peeves with SimCity 4 and was very much so looking forward to SimCity 6 (2013) which ended up being an EXTREME disappointment and should have been called SimTown instead. I was finding myself completing a City in less than 2 hours, and got so frustrated with the game that I took to their Facebook page and left a rather lengthy post that hundreds of others seemed to share the same feelings in regards to the lack of attention put into the game.Then comes Cities: Skylines. My girlfriend actually purchased a copy for me as a gift and I had my eye on it for awhile, just never made the purchase because I didn't have time to play (full-time developer).I can honestly say this is everything that SimCity SHOULD have been, or at least what EA Games promised us it would be.-> [ Steam Workshop ]The steam workshop is the HUGE seller for me. Almost any building, tool and mod is available to integrate into the game. I have well over 200 addons packed into my game, and almost an endless supply of buildings I can place, which ensures my city doesn't look the same everywhere. This is probably my FAVORITE thing about the game, is the huge support for this game through the workshop.-> [ Detailed Building Tools ]Everything from the terrain tools, the different types of roads you can place, and the ability to toggle the grid system on/off makes it possible to pretty much create anything you want. No two cities should look alike if you truly utilize the tools you are given.-> [ Sandbox Mode ]When I play these simulators, I don't like going through and playing the scenarios and having to watch my money. This game gives me the ability to have an unlimited source of money, and just build away.-> [ Game Engine ]Everything is beautiful in regards to the games appearance and performance. FPS is extremely smooth, and the entire city looks amazing (especially at night with the lights on). I haven't ran into any bugs, and I can pretty much crank the graphics up to ultra for everything, and the level of detail is very very real.-> [ Traffic ]It is relatively easy to control traffic in this game. You just have to map out where your dense traffic is going to be, and adjust accordingly with the right roads, and the other methods of transportation are great as well! (Bus, airport, tram, etc).I did find one minor annoyance. It appears that Sims get sick quite frequently, especially in a highly populated city. Theirs almost never a moment where I don't hear an ambulance screaming past me where I'm building. In fact one time, I was just browsing the city, and one of my main busy roads had 17 ambulances one after another, going to different calls... that's a little excessive.... I don't even see them that much in Los Angeles...Overall, it's a great game, and definitely worth the price. I think the DLCs are a little over-priced for what they provide, but that's certainly not a reason to not buy the game.It looks like EA Games is no longer the king of City Simulators.Regards,Richard"

Best decision I made that week. My friend taught me the basics and my city went from strength to strength, which made my friend jealous because it beat his.When I was younger I loved playing Sim City 4, and still want to play it from time to time, but Cities is an improvement on that game. I no longer find myself looking at Sim City and needing to play it, if I want to build a city I'm drawn to Cities now instead.HOWEVER, some of the unique buildings require you to do badly, even being in the negative money. So I had to go from 4.5million to -1 which was harder work than it really should have been.

217,83.2,Not Recommended, February 6,20,"This game is a very disappointing city simulator. The economic simulation is extremely shallow and it is pretty trivial to make tons of cash and nearly max out the quality of all the zones. Every issue that plagues real cities is completely absent from this game, such as homelessness, poverty, corporations given tax breaks to move in becoming a services burden, farmers rights vs developers, etc. You can completely zorch whole districts and nobody complains and there is no popularity to keep up. There are no difficult scenarios where you have to make difficult choices to pull some city out of hell. There are districts you can make and assign different municipial laws to them and they sound important, but the only change some thing by 1~3% and are completely unnecessary for managing your city successfully. Even SimCity 3000 did this way better.This is more like a very easy to use CAD program for city scapes. If you have some city layout utopia you want to build up and take screenshots from tons of angles, and buy DLC to take screenshots while its night, raining, or snowing, go for it."

This is the worst development oversight I have ever seen.It is like they expect you to build the city 1 building at a time. (which is impossible, the industry will shut down if there are not enough people)They keep you ""in the dark"" as well. You see sick, and dying people icon's, but you will never know what the cause is.At least the community is helpful. I found a mod that randomizes the age, and someone gave me a few tips to help minimize the ""death wave""."

I've enjoyed this style of game since the first Simcity. The bugs dont appear right away with a smaller city as such everything seems fine at first and the game is enjoyable. After spending hours building your city up is when the issues start to become apparent. Some people have managed to make a large city without issue but many have not so its hard to say where the problem lies.(different windows versions, certain DLC, etc) This may explain all the positive reviews as most havent played long enough to have this issue and some were lucky enough that the issuesnever manifested on there system. After spending hours building your city up is when the issues start to become apparent. I have spent a lot of time on building multiple cities trying to narrow down the problems and insure that it wasn't my city design. The first and main issue is garbage. There is a great article in the forums on how its handled called ""Garbage is Rubbish"", however all those issues aren't game breakers. As your city becomes larger the incinerators send out less and less trucks. There is no logical reason for this to happen. Many have suggested poor traffic layout is the issue but even if it were (its not in my case) it still has no logic. ""There is a traffic jam across town don't send out any garbage trucks across the entire city but pay everyone for the day."" Traffic is another whole issue that could take up a paragraph but again its not game breaking just unrealistic, annoying, and somewhat limits any creativity you may have in your city design. With average happiness running close to 90%, traffic efficiency averaging around 90%, and 20 times the required incinerator capacity there shouldn't be any issues but it breaks somewhere between 150,000-300,000 population every time and garbage trucks just stop running across the entire city and of course the entire city collapses. Crematoriums seem to have a silmilar issue but I've never had them get to the point of complete collapse. Mods were added to see if any of them would help but they didn't. Tech support was of no help and of course denied there was any issue.While experimenting with the garbage issue I noticed something else. Your net income isn't entirely based on fixed game factors and adjusts itself. I can only guess this is an attempt to maintain some semblence of difficulty and 'balance' so you can't let your game run for days to have a large bank account even if you design the perfect city. At first I thought it might be my city design and management that my profits were never very large but as a lot of time and experimentation went on there is more to it. The best example which was tried several times with different cities is that a good size city ran for a couple (real) days without making any changes and though the weekly income bounced around slightly it averaged out at pretty close to $0 and the overall bank account hadn't really changed very much. A mod was added that quartered the garbage costs, the mod doesn't affect any other game mechanics and no other changes were made. At the time garbage costs were around $200,000 so they quartered to $50,000. In theory after this the net profit should average out to $150,000 but this wasn't the case. Initially the profit jumps up to close to this amount but after a short while it settled in around an average profit of $15,000 and then stays there. It seems no matter what was done it would never maintain anything over $20,000 average net profit for more than a short burst.It's unfortunate that all my play time was basically beta testing instead of just playing and enjoying the game.In closing this game has so much going for it and most of the issues it has are minor and could be overlooked if they could only fix the big issues."

All the ones that I actually like are pretty dated, and the older UIs usually prevent me from having any fun. Cities Skylines is different. Most the strategy comes from road building where traffic is your major enemy. This makes prudent planning vitally important and means you can kind of skip over the micro-managing (if you wish, but there are plenty of options too). I've spent hours in a sandbox-city with infinite money just designing highway interchanges and had fun doing it!The game is beautiful, and with the workshop integration the possibilities are endless.

110,113.7,Recommended," August 1, 2015",5,"The defining experience of the city-building game, the level of detail in Skylines. Every last citizen (or ""Cim,"" in a nod to the Cities series' inspiration) is modeled; every last car or truck on the road carries a Cim or else cargo for a defined destination. Busses pull up, and individual Cims board and depart. They drive, take the train, or even walk to their destination. It is this level of detail that truly defines the transit side of the game: if one of your roads is clogged with congestion, there are very specific reasons why, and your options for dealing with it are vast. Add more roads? If so, which type? Would a bus line help? Probably not if it's all truck traffic; maybe a cargo train station? Hell, if it's all one factory that's causing the congestion, which can be checked by clicking on the individual trucks as they come and go, maybe you could even destroy the factory.But outside of the transit side of things, the game is just ridiculously easy. As a veteran of SimCity 1 through 4, the defining challenge of that game -- the fact that you're always broke -- is gone here. My second city was generating such insane amounts of cash by the time it hit 10k citizens that money stopped being a factor altogether, letting me do completely insane things like putting entire interstate highway systems underground or putting subway stops in every insignificant little suburban area. Things like crime and health require very little attention to manage. Your town's buildings are apparently made of gasoline-soaked cardboard and are constantly catching fire, so you need something like 5 fire stations for every police station, but again it's not a big deal since money is a non-issue. Your city's expansion is limited by your ability to do all that tedious R/C/I zoning.Well, that and your ability to manage your city's transit. It's like all the rest of the game is just an excuse to frame the devs' real interest: creating an intricate transit simulation, with every last train, plane, ship, bus, truck, car and scooter simulated individually. So while the series pretends to be the offshoot of SimCity, it's actually the offshoot of Cities in Motion.But whatever the shortcomings are, it's certainly better and far more fun than the dumpster fire known as the latest SimCity.

Replace the entire broken simulation engine with something that actually works and scales well. Make the map bigger and massively expandable. Throw in a whole bucket of small ""why didn't anyone think of THAT before?"" features that aren't quite transformative but deliver enough of an impact to get you grinning ear to ear.Oh, and divide the launch price by two. Voila! You have Cities: Skylines.While this is not quite a genre-defining, groundbreaking upgrade over the 12-year-old SimCity 4 (it still lacks region play and inter-city trading), it manages to build on most of that legendary title's major milestones while also replicating almost entirely the presentational charms of its botched sequel. The game has its fair share of mild annoyances, most of which involve the way its massive piles of data are presented to the player, but it speaks volumes that one of its greatest issues is how difficult it is to praise it without comparing it to SimCity.Maxis is dead. Long live Colossal Order. A tiny studio from Finland (with a hilarious CEO) has accomplished a feat that previously eluded more illustrious development teams for more than a decade. Cities: Skylines is a must-buy for genre newcomers and SimCity veterans alike, and it will likely go down as an instant classic and the new high water mark for urban planning sims."

It's sold at a reasonable price, it has huge scope, & the modding community is awesome adding an enormous amount of content for free.I do have a few gripes however...Traffic becomes a real pain as your city grows. It becomes a major frustration trying to solve your cities traffic woes. Adding other means of travel has little effect as roads to & from your airports, harbours, & train stations often just moves the issue from 1 place to another. Trains themselves become a real headache as there's only 2 entrance & exit tracks on the map. The problem is that your cargo & commuter trains share the same track. You can split them once they enter your city, but they enter & leave your city on the same track. This causes them to back up which has a knock-on effect on the cargo & people aboard. Things are fine at low density, but as soon as you add high-rise high desity the traffic just really starts to go pair shaped.Another issue I found was the death rate. I don't know whether ibola is hitting my city, but whole blocks die off in a matter of in-game seconds. I live in a town, & in the 12 years I've lived there only 1 person has ever died. I keep pollution right down & clincs & hospitals abundant. It must be a balancing issue.All in all it can be a fun game, but as the city grows the game begins to irritate me.

It's exciting to keep up with what your city requires: houses, shops, factories, electricity, water supply, transportation, education and more! It does take quite a while to understand the game. When you get used to it, that's when the fun starts. The hardest part of the game is not what and where to build things, but how to maintain the people's happiness and well-being while the city expands.Pros:- beautiful graphics- detail-oriented- incredible gameplay elements- great and surreal sound effects- has many map choices with different difficulty- doesn't slow your game down when the city expands (another city-sim game I've tried does slow the game when the city is large)- achievements and card drop available.Cons:- No tutorial, so you just need to play and learn from the tip and try to experience by your own.

Furthermore, the sheer fact that it was a city builder and being aware how good Cities in Motion 2 was (350+ hrs I've put into it...) I was extremely excited but I guess you could say I was a bit aprehensive too.That apprehension is long gone. This game is an instant classic, on par with the likes of SimCity 4. Let me tell you why;Built to be moddable, at the time of writing (72hrs post release), there has been a staggering 6000 submissions to the Steam Workshop with some fairly advanced mods, it's not just the cosmetics.No more towns- up to 1,000,000 people can be simulated. They all have their own homes, workpalces and families. No more GlasBox nonsense from EA here, this is the real thing.There are obviously some minor hiccups here, nowhere near as bad as SimCity and no DRM or online nonsense either. Day/Night cycles are gone and so are tunnels but the latter has already been planned as the first DLC for Cities: Skylines. Also, seeing as CO are a small team, the mod community are working tirelessly to work on the superb foundation CO have set for us - the vanila expereince is amazing but the sheer flexibility and moddability of this game will see this title have a life cycle similar to that of Sim City.

245,5.8,Recommended," November 30, 2016",7,"Cities: Skylines is one of the best city builders out there. In my opinion it's not the best but it's still very good. Sim builders are subjective so this game may be very good for a player or boring depending on how you like to play builders. The reason it doesn't appeal to me is because this game concentrates more on management than simply plotting down buildings. There are some buildings and items you can plot down like DLC content, parks, emergency buildings, schools, water and power management, etc. But skyscrapers, houses and other common buildings you can't pick from a menu and place it. Most of the building area is managed by zoning off areas (residential, commercial, office, industry). In other words, depending on how well you run your city will determine how many buildings and homes your city residents build. If you don't have enough educated people or zoned neighborhoods then businesses will not build up. If you don't have enough jobs people will move out. If either one is neglected too long then buildings shut down and you have to demolish them to make your city appealing. I will say that the road customization and mechanics of the game is pretty good. Some of the DLCs look very impressive but I've not bought them. The Natural Disasters DLC looks like it'd spice up the games some.In a nutshell: If you like city management and like the city to build itself then you'll love this game. If you like to pick buildings and other structures from a menu to place at your heart's desire and not worry so much about the management stuff I recommend Sim City from EA.Pros:Great city builderRoads cusomizations are on pointManagement - for those who like a challengeGood graphicsWorkshop itemsUnlimited money option - for those who just want to buildDLC contentSteam cloud save - if you get a new PC you'll be thankful for this!More of a management game, not enough picking structures from a list and freely placing them.Music could be better.Sometimes the game goes after you about one problem and it seems nothing fixes it. For example, I felt like I had to keep building schools because my citizens were uneducated. After about a dozen schools I was done...just over it. And my city was still very small. My first game had a similar problem, public health. Had to keep building more and more clinics. This could be a problem without unlimited money turned on."

461,26.0,Recommended," April 9, 2017",5,"Cities: Skylines is one of those rare city building simulation games that actually does everything perfectly. All the game mechanics just fit into this game like clockwork, which is why you can get so immersed and play countless hours on end.City Planning - Be aware that you should plan out how each part of your city should be built. For example connecting public transport lines, roads or even power grids might involve destroying certain buildings which can have a negative affect on the population happiness.Districts - These can be used with the brush tool, you can then add a district policy on a housing area for example, which might focus this area on recycling more.Natural Disasters - This DLC is worth while and allows you to prepare for and counter any natural world disasters that might occur by planning things like evacuation routes.Global happiness - Like most strategy games, the overall happiness of your population is always an important factor to monitor. Build things like public transport, provide them with basic services like education/healthcare as well as basic needs like jobs or natural resources and you won't have anthing to worry about.Overall, while Cities Skylines has a bit of a learning curve for beginners I highly recommend you pick it up simply for the immersion, my final score 8/10 :)"

3,335.5,Not Recommended, March 29,21,"Cities: Skylines recived many praise due to EA's Sim Cities being a failed game. If Sim Cities was better, this game would have been shuned by the most part of it. People are giving this game way to much credit.To begin with, the vanilla game by its self is mediocre at best. The gameplay is okay but the vanilla textures are an eye sore. And half the texture are just reused from their older, more transported based game, Cities in Motion. Sure it maybe a good idea to reuse but the textures just don't look all that great. People realy give this game so much credit because of the mods, not the vinilla game. But the more mods you have, the slower the game runs thus having to limit your mod intake.I bought this game when it was only $16.99. Once the developers saw the profits they were making, they raised the price on us, an EA move. Once they saw we bought their first two DLC's, they began to create more and focus less on giving us free updates. Half of the DLC content should have already been in the game. A day and Night cycle, above-ground metros, season, etc.I'm just saying, the game used to be worth it when it only cost half of what it was. If you do buy it remeber, you are realy only paying for a quarter of the game, keep in mind that EA... I mean Colossal Order, just wants your money."
41,"1,535.8",Recommended," January 15, 2016",16,"First time review but felt compelled to about this game. If you are a fan of the whole tycoon, city building genre then Cities SKylines is for you.The support of the product through the workshop is like a treasure trove filled with replica buildings, unique designs and detailed assets which allow you to craft almost anything you can imagine within your city.The mods can be a little bit frustrating and dangerous to your save games but handled correctly (I'd highly recommend reading about the mods you are thinking about using in the workshop before downloading any) they add even more oppotunities to develop the gameplay, fixing minor frustrations and adding more simplitic and unique controls.If you are new to the genre then this is an excellent game to start from. Great value, it was only £22 when it first came out, and an even better workshop, this gane will suck you in for hours."
18,717.2,Recommended," May 20, 2017",16,"The problem with this game is that you really need a lot of mods for it to look any good and play in a way that is entertaining. In my opinion, it would have been wise if the developers had made buildings that looked more realistic as base buildings and less garish, then fewer mods would be required. Now, however, with each update I find that with about 200 assets/mods downloaded, one will always corrupt my files. This is so very annoying, I feel as though I waste my many hours given to this game if it all gets corrupted. And the answer isn't as simple as ""don't play with mods."" Quite honestly, the game is pretty much crap without mods. It's flat and lackluster as it isn't much more than boring and repetative tasks with few rewarding acheivements (buildings and the like) or gameplay progression. Frankly, a rework of the base buildings pack is in order. We've seen what this game capable of - meet that expectation Paradox. All things considered I have definitely enjoyed many hours of this game (500 hours or something crazy) - I'm a pretty devoted fan, but I'm starting to feel dissapointed. Haven't tried it yet, but the Mass Transit expansion seems like a great move. Regardless, the game is worth a try. If you find you don't like it in the first hour, return it, but if you play more than that then I guarantee you'll get your moneys worth."

547,68.1,Not Recommended," February 22, 2016",59,"Yeah it's a bit late for a review - but I'm glad I'm writing one now as had I written it at release it would have been full of praise as a must buy game...Thing is, almost a year later this game still has a ton of irritating bugs that you absolutely must install mods for. I could deal with that - except the mods are poorly supported and very frequently break with patches leaving you with useless save games.I could even deal with that - if the patches that the developer was putting out were fixing major issues. Thing is..they haven't. CO seems to have forgotten about the many annoyances of this game and been happy to let the modding community sort them out.Unfortunately it seems that many of the issues that this game suffers from just have not been adequately addressed by mods. Traffic is a complete nightmare with the AI behaving oddly and as such designing a high density city is incredibly tedious as you will spend 99% of your time fighting with traffic.Ok - fine, we can say that the traffic is the core challenge of skylines as really beyond that the game is trivially simple - but even that turns into hours of frustration as the tools you have for building roads are amazingly clunky. Some of the most popular mods are ways of disabling pillars, road intersection angle limitations and slope limitations for roads - but even those mods are tedious to use as you have a very clunky interface for building roads and no built in teraforming tools. The mods that do exist are clunky to use or result in incredibly ugly and unrealistic looking roads.These are all issues that have been listed from day one - so where are we a year later? Same place of course! CO has released a pair of unimpressive DLCs which are mostly cosmetic and at times annoying. After Dark does not add much except tunnels that is of any use and the night mode is just another layer of frustration as building at night is difficult - unless you get that mod that lights up your mouse cursor. Snowfall adds trams which are basically expensive buses with no other advantages that I can see - there is effectively no real reason to use them besides aesthetics as metro and buses get the job done better and easier. Heated pipes offer little change in the game.So here we are - a year later and the game still feels like it needs ~30 essential mods to enjoy and even that enjoyment is basically fighting with the road building system for 2 hours to build a single good looking and working highway off-ramp.I really want to love this game but every single time I play it I feel more drained and frustrated by it than my day job."
345,13.0,Not Recommended," February 4, 2017",79,"Even though this is a negative review, it comes with a caveat. I want challenge and simulation out of a strategy or management game, and Cities: Skylines does not provide that. If you like just building a nice city then you'll love Cities: SkylinesSort of like Planet Coaster, Cities is basically just a map painter. You can't literally do whatever you want but you would be hard-pressed to come up against any challenge beyond screwing up traffic configurations. You'll never run out of money and never run up against a fail state that you either didn't bring upon yourself on purpose or that you didn't see coming a mile away.I'm really disappointed in this title. Lots of people love it so I'm assuming that I made a mistake in not reading into the game enough before purchasing it. However, I just want to warn anyone who is looking for a good challenge to stay away."

1,195.7,Recommended," July 9, 2015",31,"OverviewCities: Skylines is another contender in the city simulation/building management genre. It plants its roots among games such as Sim City and Cities XL to name a select few. What Cities: Skylines does is take those games, turn them upside down and offer a fresh new perspective on a dated genre. To say the game surpasses previous games of this type would be an understatement. The game pulls ahead of the race and never looks back. The developers wanted something new and exciting and Cities: Skylines has it in spades.The overall gameplay is much the same: you start out on a pre-defined landmass with a stack of cash and only your imagination standing in your way. It's your job to name your city, form your plan of attack and make your city thrive (or fail if that's your thing). Much like previous installments in the genre, you'll have your selection of various densities of residential and commercial business, as well as industrial zoning. Cities: Skylines adds to that, offering you the ability to specialize areas for specific purposes with city ordinances - farming and forestry, higher taxes, lower taxes, pollution control, heavy traffic bans, legalization of marijuana...you get the idea. Rather than just zone an area and let it grow, the game offers a deeper look in balancing out wants and needs of your city.Aside from zoning and city ordinances, Cities: Skylines delves into other noteworthy favorites: Emergency services, schools, recreational and public transportation (roads, buses, trains, airports...etc). While most items don't have much involvement aside from adjusting budgets, you are given the ability to create a multitude of transition lines and customize the stops, name them and change the vehicle colors. It helps keep everything neat and orderly.Where the game really shines is within its ability to create mods and custom assets that can be implemented into the game by the community via the Steam Workshop. This takes the vanilla game to a whole new level, introducing new buildings, cars, parks, landscapes to build on, monuments or something entirely brand new. Without the workshop, the game is still pleasant and quite enjoyable, but there is a lot missing in terms of diversity. The workshop gives you that diversity, practically slapping you in the face with it. It takes Cities: Skylines from a great game, to an outstanding game.Now, like all games, there is always room for improvement. While I feel the game is great and I've thoughly enjoyed my time playing it, I feel it falls short in some of the deeper city management aspects. Taxes, for example, don't often need adjusting outside a very fine line unless you want to go bankrupt or have your citizens moving en mass.Once you get your city off the ground, it's very difficult to ""lose"", if you will. You'll be making money hand over fist unless you crank up the difficulty, which then makes budgeting more of a necessity, especially in the beginning of the game, but less so later on as long as you don't do anything drastic that puts you in the red. Since there are no natural disasters as of this review, and fires are localized to just the building on fire (mods do change it so they spread), widespread epidemics aren't a threat, making the need to prepare all but nonexistent.I feel the game is wonderful for what it offers, but feels too easy at times. However, I don't feel any of those negatives negate the enjoyment the game offers.Overall, Cities: Skylines is a great city builder. It's something I had been waiting for since I played Sim City 4 into the ground back in 2004. If you're into the genre and looking for the right one, Cities: Skylines is, in my opinion, one of the best games out there at this moment. I highly recommend it."

196,33.4,Recommended," July 4, 2016",10,"I've never played a city simulation game before, but this one is apparently considered one of the best, and I had fun playing it.You can be anally involved in the tiniest details of traffic organization, or spend the entire game in god-view 1000ft above the city. At first you will mess up and make rookie mistakes in city planning, but helpful tutorials and obnoxious pop-up messages will have you learning quickly. There is a downside to being successful though. For the end game buildings (Monuments), you must build a variety of Unique Buildings, half of them only being awarded to you for being bad at the game. For example; high unemployment, massive trash buildup, high crime, poor health, and many abandoned buildings. You must deliberately ruin your city to get these last buildings, which sucks. The rest of the buildings however, are simply unlocked from population checkpoints.When you're not worrying about handicapping your city, you'll be scratching your head on how to solve the various problems that crop up, two examples being trash and pollution. See, citizens need trash services, but these buildings only cover a very small area, and create pollution. Thus, you have trash burning facilities inside the neighborhood- which cause people to get sick from the pollution. No matter how many Health services you have near the area, people still get sick and die, and there's nothing to fix it other than by creating gaps where nobody lives. Now mind you, mods can fix these inconsistences, but the devs punish you for using any mods by locking you out from earning achievements entirely.In conclusion, Cities:Skylines is a competent and fun city sim. It has some problems, many of which can be fixed by mods, but in doing so you are not allowed to earn achievements. The progression in end-game is flawed, but the rest of the game is steady and engaging.Also, apparently the Deluxe Edition doesn't come with ANY of the DLC."

It is lacking in terms of finer controls and mid to late game changes, but the modding support has been great and the game is only going to get bigger with future content and DLC.If you're looking for something incredibility difficult to build and maintain like in Banished, Skylines isn't it. It's more about sandbox play and letting the player do what they want, but again all that could change with DLC and continued support. This would also be a great entry into city building or something to show kids the basic steps of city management and planning."
11,213.9,Not Recommended," April 3, 2015",8,"It's more of a road network building simulator than a city simulator. All of the zones you zone and all of the buildings you build are there to drive traffic in & out of your city. 90% of your planning and building and organizing goes towards the road network, to the point of micromanaging and obsessing. 90% of the problems you will face when laying out your city will be road related.Building the city just involves dragging zones with a paint tool and plonking down service buildings like hospitals and schools. All the cities end up looking and feeling very, very similar. The cities are very easy to build and grow. The only real challenge you ever face is designing a road network that flows and is not chaotic. This is fine. This can be fun. This can be interesting, and challenging. But this does not qualify as a city simulator."

690,325.8,Recommended," March 20, 2015",6,"Finally, a good city builder after all these years! Cities: Skylines seems to handle very well everything the other recent city builders couldn't. For starters - it works. I'll admit the game did crash once for me, but it seems to have been an isolated incident. After playing 26 hours, this one crash is the only negative I can come up with. The game seems to squeeze all the juice out of my system in terms of CPU and GPU usage (Intel i7 Quad Core 2.67Ghz, 16GB RAM, Geforce GTX465), but in return it gives me a smooth and enjoyable playing experience! Unlike the competition, you can build large cities, but there are no slowdowns, no stuttering and no need to restart the game every 30 minutes.As of now, to my knowledge, Cities: Skylines is the only good city building game available. The other two I'm aware of (Simcity, Cities XXL) don't even come close, as they have too many problems."
34,10.6,Not Recommended, March 19,83,"I enjoy games like this, and this is probably one of the best games i've ever played for its kind. If there was a ""Semi-recommend"" option rather than just the ""Recommend"" and ""Not Recommended"" option, i'd choose it. The reason for it being not recommended is that some of the features in the game are not very well made or ""Optimized"" for it; traffic is the best example. I wont explain traffic because its a common problem explained in MANY other ""Not recommended"" reviews that explain its flaws way better than i can. My biggest problem is the DLC; Most of the more expensive DLC are quite literally features that should be in the base game alone, it doesnt make sense (other than to milk your money from you) to put them behind a heafty paywall. After Dark, Snowfall, Mass Transit, and Green Cities should be in the game itself in the original purchase, not DLC. Natural Disasters could be argued weither or not it should or shouldnt be in the base game.I would recommend it if it was on sale, but the DLC isn't something i ever intend on buying since it seems like stuff i shouldnt HAVE to buy in the first place, it should be free or already in the game."
36,76.0,Recommended, February 16,6,"Summary: Cities: Skylines is possibly the greatest city builder ever made, but that does not make it perfect.As stated in the summary of this review, I do think that Cities: Skylines is one of the greatest city builders ever made. There are a lot of small details that make this game a cut above everything else, and the level of detail put into the environment and the lives of the people in your city make this game the most detailed city builder ever made. Surprisingly, this game runs beautifully despite this insane level of detail and very pleasing graphical design. There is a lot of replayability in this game, and you can easily sit down and lose track of time taking care of your cities. These factors alone make this game a recommendation for me.However, despite being one of the best games in it's genre, Cities: Skylines has a lot of problems. My first issue with this game is something that the developers love to bring up when talking about this game: the traffic simulation. Generally, the simulation is pretty good, but cars will almost always run into each other, and cars are happy to change 3 lines at once and stop all traffic along a road right before they need to turn off of a road. I have had 4 lane freeways rendered useless because cars will all jam up into 1 or 2 lanes, leaving the left 2 lanes completely empty and the right 2 lanes completely clogged up. Thankfully, because the developers support the modding community, there are mods to help fix some of these issues, such as mods that allow you to customize what lanes cars are allowed to go into at certain areas of a road, and mods that allow you to remove unnecessary traffic lights at an intersection. The simulation is pretty good, but not perfect.Secondly, I think the DLC's cost too much money and do not provide much content to prove worthy of the $13-$15 pricetag. This isn't a big issue, as the base game is so cheap and regularly on sale, and content such as the day/night cycle are added to the base game, but I wish the DLC could just be cheaper or provide more content.My final issue with this game is that, at least in my experiences, the game is not fun to play unless you are in Sandbox Mode and have Unlock All/Unlimited Money on. The roads, buildings, and utilities that the game let's you start with are so small that you pretty much have to build an ugly ""money generator"" every time you start the game to keep yourself from going bankrupt and having to restart from scratch. The starting cash of $70,000 is nowhere near enough money to get yourself going, and I have found myself at balances of $10,000 after building all the essential roads/infrastructure of an ugly ""money generator."" From there, I just have to wait until I have enough funds and people to where I have unlocked all of the core roads/utilities/buildings and to where I can actually design a good looking and functioning city. Going into a sandbox game with several mods installed has been my favorite experience while playing this game.This being said, the developers have made a great move by adding Steam Workshop support and an in-game asset/terrain editor. Accepting the modding community is one thing that has made this city builder so much better compared to terrible city builders such as the most recent SimCity. You can find new roads, new buildings, new maps, new themes, and pretty much anything else you could ever want, on the Steam Workshop. The community has really accepted this game and helped improve it from it's already great state. Therefore, despite my negatives said above, I recommend this game to people who love management games, to people who enjoy city builders, and to people who generally have a lot of time to spend tweaking, creating, and restarting cities."

No. She would seek out and consume cat poop and begged at the table when we tried to have dinner, but I didn't care. She was an awesome dog and I spent hours playing with her.Near the end of her life, her liver shut down. She started to♥♥♥♥♥♥and puke in the house, and even started to snap at me; she was in a lot of pain. In the end the vet suggested we put her down. It was a sad day. I had lost a best friend that I had for years, but it was for the best.Later we got a new dog. A Yellow Lab/German Shepard mix named Milo. Milo was not Sparky, but he is still an awesome dog. Playful, good with kids, cutely vocal and a big lump who's good for hugging. He isn't perfect either, he sheds like crazy, but that doesn't make him a bad dog.Why did I ramble on about dogs?The Sim City Franchise is Sparkey, with 5imCity 2013 being her post liver-failure. A game series I remember fondly as the stuff of my childhood, willfully editing out what happened at the very end.Cities: Skylines is Milo. A new dog, a different dog, but an awesome dog.If you are a fan of city building games at all, you are going to want to pick this game up right now. It is only $30 AT LAUNCH. That is not a sale price, that is the full undiscounted price and it is worth double that (which, by the way, is what 5imCity 2013 cost at launch).

611,79.0,Recommended," March 16, 2015",4,"If you're one of those people whom, like me, was let down by the release of SimCity 2013, this game is for you.If you're one of those people whom was pleased with SimCity 2013, this game is for you.If you enjoy city builders, THIS GAME IS FOR YOU.Let's begin.First, why is this game for those of us let down by simcity 2013?This game harnesses what made the older simcity games great and adds on to it the way I expect a sequel should have added on to the previous major installment, SimCity 4. There is no online DRM whatsoever, the map sizes are initially restricted to a 2x2 km square like SC 2013 but can be expanded up to 6x6 in any arrangement, or modded to 10x10 km (25 plots of 2x2 land). That's a lot. That even matches up with the ""huge"" cities XL franchise, and I feel like it may even surpass it at times as ALL maps are capable of reaching this size.This game brings back features that some may like, some may not - power lines, water pipes, some of the busywork we found ourselves doing in older simcity games. Despite having no in-game terraforming, the game does have a map editor that uses easy-to-use terraforming-style tools you would use in simcity games, as well as supporting heightmap importing and exporting allowing you to easily create real world locations to build in, or make your own and export them to the steam workshop for others to enjoy. An asset editor, much like the old urban renewal kits, allows you to modify buildings or add new ones, as well as upload them to the steam workshop again or download ones others have made.As far as straight up gameplay features, you will be happy to see the return of mass transit on a large scale that SimCity 2013 removed most of. You'll have trains, boats, planes, buses, subways, and highways to manage, as well as being able to create lines for each that add to the realism and also control of the game rather than plopping stops and letting the mass transit roam free. You'll also find that while there is no regional play, you instead have cities within cities - districts, you can say. Each can have their own ordinances/policies, their own tax rates, and be specialized differently than other districts or the rest of the city. Zones find the addition of a new type of zone, Offices, which act as a form of clean industrial zone. You'll also find yourself now dealing with the dead, and having cemeteries and crematoriums to send them to.Why is this game for those of you that LIKED simcity 2013? (repeats a bit)First of all, the graphics in SimCity 2013 were without doubt the greatest a city builder has ever seen. This game matches, and in some ways, surpasses what SimCity 2013 was capable of in the graphical department. You keep the tilt-shift effect which appears to have been improved, and texture work is beyond amazing.Now, you won't be finding any multiplayer or regional play in this game. However, what you WILL find is mods. A lot of mods. Hundreds of mods, maps, and addons on the steam workshop already at the time of this review. They're easy to obtain, and you can turn them on or off within the game itself. You'll also notice map sizes are far bigger, which means you have so much room you can effectivelly still do your regional play - cities the size of that in SimCity 2013 were 2x2 km in size, and this game allows you to get 9 such plots by default, 25 plots with a mod. That's 25 spaces that could be used however you want, all linked to one another not by a preset highway, but by you and how you want them to be connected. It's also likely that anyone who's played SimCity 2013 has played a previous simcity, and you will find every feature of those old games - minus the regional play and neighbor deals as a direct result - in here. You will also still find city specialization in a different style than that of SC2013. Rather than placing individual buildings, you will instead create districts (cities within cities, each having their own taxes and ordinances/policies) and specialize them to agriculture, oil drilling, ore mining, or forestry. The industrial zones you place within these districts will then switch to utilize your chosen specialization, replacing their buildings with ones suited for what you want. This allows you to create far bigger specialized areas, and far quicker and with more ease. In the event you require resources that would otherwise be extracted from these specializations, such as to run coal or oil power plants, they will be automatically imported through trains, boats, planes, or simple road at no extra cost to you - just keep the traffic flowing so the delivery trucks can reach their destination.If this sounds easy, it's not. This game can bite you alive several hours in. You will find it far more challenging than simcity 2013 or cities XL ever has been, and that's without activating the built-in hard mode mod. At first, it will be easy - that's due to you building in a small area of land with limited building availability. It's when everything is unlocked and you're sitting there with 100,000 fully simulated citizens running around their daily lives that all hell crumbles down on you.Do you enjoy city builders? You play tropico, or cities XL, etc? Play this.I'm going to skip the basic stuff and say it straight forward. Anything you can do in Cities XL or Tropico (in regards to city building, I'm aware tropico has dictator stuff going on that you won't find here), you are more than capable of doing here in a much easier way. You have more control over customization, more control over the city, and all taking place in a game that looks better and has one of the best developers and publishers out there at your back for support with the steam workshop throwing hundreds at the time of this review, THOUSANDS in the near future, of mods, maps, and addons in your direction to play with as well as letting you make your OWN with ease. That is all.I grew up playing SimCity, and soon found myself playing other city builders in the form of Tropico and City Life. Cities XL was a game I tried to like and just couldn't due to how unplayable it was, and tropico is re-releasing a similar game every year with little effort to innovate anymore like PopTop used to back in the day. SimCity 2013 looked promising in trailers, but upon its' release I tried my hardest to like it with 130 hours of game time but I could not make myself like it. It was simply too small scale and too easy, and I just missed everything you could do with the older simcity games. Modding was so easy for SimCity 4, and the cities were so much more fun to make, that upon going back I wondered why I had ever tried to like SimCity 2013 in the first place. I even dug up my old SimCity 2000 and 3000 discs and got those running, and since I'm not old enough to have experienced SimCity for the SNES when it initially came out, even got myself a cartridge for that off of amazon and gave it a whirl. Each gave me hours and hours of enjoyment that 2013's verison never could. Cities Skylines I was rather worried about actually, as I thought they would focus too much on fixing the city sizes and offline to actually add anything worthwhile or fun beyond that and this game would end up along the lines of Cities XL for production value. I have never been more wrong and I am really, REALLY pleased to say that. I owe an absolutely massive thank you to Colossal and Paradox for making this game in such a fantastic state. They have managed to bring a childhood game back for many of us in a fantastic way.This is the greatest city builder in over a decade to be released. Colossal Order and Paradox Interactive have stated that more content and updates are going to be on our way for years to come, so we can only expect it to get better from here. Also, did you notice the game is only $30? Why are you still reading this...GO AND BUY THE GAME ALREADY!Recommend: YES. YES. YES. SO MUCH YES."

92,76.3,Recommended," September 27, 2016",4,"I know that this game has got a lot of love in terms of mod content. If I talk about negative points in this game or positive ones they can be fixed or enhanced with mods. If you do buy the game you should try them out.I love how the game provides you the freedom to do whatever you want. You need water,sewage power and roads and from that point you can start building districts and creating your own city without any restrictions. If you don't consider slope a restriction, it shouldn't be considered as one because you can terraform. I noticed while building my cities that I still didn't use all the buildings that are available in this game that's because there are so many options. The transport options in this game are also pretty elaborated. You can build airports, trainstations, harbors, tramstations and busstations. The game also provides a good dose of challenge if you are willing to expand your city a lot. Starting from 60000 population, which is a truck load of people and can't be done in a day, you unlock monuments. For each of these monuments you have to complete challenges to unlock the building itself. Some of these challenges really require you to screw up your city and survive, for example lower your taxes to 5 procent and survive for 5 years. If that isn't enough you have to get back to the point that you were at before the challenge and then save up around a million. If that isn't enough challenge I don't know what is to you.Although this a pretty good game there are some important downsides. Starting with traffic as the main issue. First off the highways leading to your city are way too small. It prevents you from fixing traffic without bulldozing as much of that highway as possible. They are very inefficient, if they were bigger they would be more useful. Another way how traffic clogs up is the bus system. In one city I made around 200 buslines, which is many but it was an experiment, half of my traffic was bus because each line had like 30-50 busses driving on it. I find it unrealistic and unnecessary to have that much busses on a line. I think setting a maximum to 10 per line, or even 5 per line, is definitly enough. Second we have the income system, not that it is something general it is more a visual issue to me than it may be to you. You see next to your money amount how much you earn per week but you gain money daily and I don't get why. It is way easier for the player to understand what is happening when it's either gaining money per week and seeing how much you earn per week than doing the two combined for some reason. Another thing I find unfortunate is the limitation. You start of with 1 plot of land and you can only expand 8 more plot, which is not a lot to me.Overall a good pickup to play once in a while with or without mods."
611,79.0,Recommended," March 16, 2015",4,"If you're one of those people whom, like me, was let down by the release of SimCity 2013, this game is for you.If you're one of those people whom was pleased with SimCity 2013, this game is for you.If you enjoy city builders, THIS GAME IS FOR YOU.Let's begin.First, why is this game for those of us let down by simcity 2013?This game harnesses what made the older simcity games great and adds on to it the way I expect a sequel should have added on to the previous major installment, SimCity 4. There is no online DRM whatsoever, the map sizes are initially restricted to a 2x2 km square like SC 2013 but can be expanded up to 6x6 in any arrangement, or modded to 10x10 km (25 plots of 2x2 land). That's a lot. That even matches up with the ""huge"" cities XL franchise, and I feel like it may even surpass it at times as ALL maps are capable of reaching this size.This game brings back features that some may like, some may not - power lines, water pipes, some of the busywork we found ourselves doing in older simcity games. Despite having no in-game terraforming, the game does have a map editor that uses easy-to-use terraforming-style tools you would use in simcity games, as well as supporting heightmap importing and exporting allowing you to easily create real world locations to build in, or make your own and export them to the steam workshop for others to enjoy. An asset editor, much like the old urban renewal kits, allows you to modify buildings or add new ones, as well as upload them to the steam workshop again or download ones others have made.As far as straight up gameplay features, you will be happy to see the return of mass transit on a large scale that SimCity 2013 removed most of. You'll have trains, boats, planes, buses, subways, and highways to manage, as well as being able to create lines for each that add to the realism and also control of the game rather than plopping stops and letting the mass transit roam free. You'll also find that while there is no regional play, you instead have cities within cities - districts, you can say. Each can have their own ordinances/policies, their own tax rates, and be specialized differently than other districts or the rest of the city. Zones find the addition of a new type of zone, Offices, which act as a form of clean industrial zone. You'll also find yourself now dealing with the dead, and having cemeteries and crematoriums to send them to.Why is this game for those of you that LIKED simcity 2013? (repeats a bit)First of all, the graphics in SimCity 2013 were without doubt the greatest a city builder has ever seen. This game matches, and in some ways, surpasses what SimCity 2013 was capable of in the graphical department. You keep the tilt-shift effect which appears to have been improved, and texture work is beyond amazing.Now, you won't be finding any multiplayer or regional play in this game. However, what you WILL find is mods. A lot of mods. Hundreds of mods, maps, and addons on the steam workshop already at the time of this review. They're easy to obtain, and you can turn them on or off within the game itself. You'll also notice map sizes are far bigger, which means you have so much room you can effectivelly still do your regional play - cities the size of that in SimCity 2013 were 2x2 km in size, and this game allows you to get 9 such plots by default, 25 plots with a mod. That's 25 spaces that could be used however you want, all linked to one another not by a preset highway, but by you and how you want them to be connected. It's also likely that anyone who's played SimCity 2013 has played a previous simcity, and you will find every feature of those old games - minus the regional play and neighbor deals as a direct result - in here. You will also still find city specialization in a different style than that of SC2013. Rather than placing individual buildings, you will instead create districts (cities within cities, each having their own taxes and ordinances/policies) and specialize them to agriculture, oil drilling, ore mining, or forestry. The industrial zones you place within these districts will then switch to utilize your chosen specialization, replacing their buildings with ones suited for what you want. This allows you to create far bigger specialized areas, and far quicker and with more ease. In the event you require resources that would otherwise be extracted from these specializations, such as to run coal or oil power plants, they will be automatically imported through trains, boats, planes, or simple road at no extra cost to you - just keep the traffic flowing so the delivery trucks can reach their destination.If this sounds easy, it's not. This game can bite you alive several hours in. You will find it far more challenging than simcity 2013 or cities XL ever has been, and that's without activating the built-in hard mode mod. At first, it will be easy - that's due to you building in a small area of land with limited building availability. It's when everything is unlocked and you're sitting there with 100,000 fully simulated citizens running around their daily lives that all hell crumbles down on you.Do you enjoy city builders? You play tropico, or cities XL, etc? Play this.I'm going to skip the basic stuff and say it straight forward. Anything you can do in Cities XL or Tropico (in regards to city building, I'm aware tropico has dictator stuff going on that you won't find here), you are more than capable of doing here in a much easier way. You have more control over customization, more control over the city, and all taking place in a game that looks better and has one of the best developers and publishers out there at your back for support with the steam workshop throwing hundreds at the time of this review, THOUSANDS in the near future, of mods, maps, and addons in your direction to play with as well as letting you make your OWN with ease. That is all.I grew up playing SimCity, and soon found myself playing other city builders in the form of Tropico and City Life. Cities XL was a game I tried to like and just couldn't due to how unplayable it was, and tropico is re-releasing a similar game every year with little effort to innovate anymore like PopTop used to back in the day. SimCity 2013 looked promising in trailers, but upon its' release I tried my hardest to like it with 130 hours of game time but I could not make myself like it. It was simply too small scale and too easy, and I just missed everything you could do with the older simcity games. Modding was so easy for SimCity 4, and the cities were so much more fun to make, that upon going back I wondered why I had ever tried to like SimCity 2013 in the first place. I even dug up my old SimCity 2000 and 3000 discs and got those running, and since I'm not old enough to have experienced SimCity for the SNES when it initially came out, even got myself a cartridge for that off of amazon and gave it a whirl. Each gave me hours and hours of enjoyment that 2013's verison never could. Cities Skylines I was rather worried about actually, as I thought they would focus too much on fixing the city sizes and offline to actually add anything worthwhile or fun beyond that and this game would end up along the lines of Cities XL for production value. I have never been more wrong and I am really, REALLY pleased to say that. I owe an absolutely massive thank you to Colossal and Paradox for making this game in such a fantastic state. They have managed to bring a childhood game back for many of us in a fantastic way.This is the greatest city builder in over a decade to be released. Colossal Order and Paradox Interactive have stated that more content and updates are going to be on our way for years to come, so we can only expect it to get better from here. Also, did you notice the game is only $30? Why are you still reading this...GO AND BUY THE GAME ALREADY!Recommend: YES. YES. YES. SO MUCH YES."

Congratulations.This game managed to overcome Sim City 2000 and Sim City 4 combined, two of my favourite city manager simulators ever. In Cities: Skylines you'll start building your city from just an intersection coming out of a highway in the middle of nowhere, manage your budget, expand, make some decisions (not enough cash, do I build a fire station or a hospital?), expand even more, watch as your small poor village in the middle of nowhere becomes a gigantic metropolis that people from all around the world come to visit.All in all, Cities: Skylines managed to be everything SimCity's reboot failed to be. The only con I have with this game is that it somehow lacks introduction, there are small tips here and there, but the complicated parts you have to discover pretty much by yourself (or search for tutorials on Youtube, lol).Now excuse me while I lose some more hours of sleep expanding my city. ):"

114,131.0,Recommended," March 15, 2015",4,"A fantastic citybuilder, my favourite since SimCity 4.Since the most likely points of comparison here are SimCity 2015 and Cities XL, I'll break it down into quick points:Compared to SimCity 2015:-Game's fully offline. The only online aspect is the integration with Steam Workshop.-Deep modding. Game include's both a map editor and an asset editor. Workshop is already bursting at the seams with stuff.-Giantic room for constructing cities. You start with a single 2x2 km square, and you can eventually purchase 8 more squares. There's already mods allowing to purchase all 25 squares a map has (that's 100 sq km).-Cims (Skylines' version of Sims) are fully simulated and actually make sense.-Traffic simulation is incredibly deep (though there's still some issues with cars accumulating in a single lane sometimes).-No building upgrade.-Specialization is not as deep as in SimCity, but the District system allows you to essentially create individual cities within the same map, with their own laws, taxes, and industrial focuses.-Several info overlays are almost copied from SimCity, even in their presentation.-Skylines is less colourful than SimCity, but also a bit more realistic.-Music isn't bad in Skylines, but SimCity's better.-Map are just a little bit smaller (Cities XL has 110 sq km, Skylines has 100 sq km with mods, 36 sq km without).-Zoning is much, more comfortable, particularly with curved roads.-No lag (although large cities can be taxing depending on your computer). Brisk road building even for huge tracks.-Graphics are somewhat similar.-Interface is far more user-friendly.-Traffic simulation is orders of magnitude more interesting.-Road variety is more or less the same (just in terms of types. Skylines' free-form roadbuilding allows for pretty much unlimited road-building methods).-So far, I've encountered not a single memory leak or similarly wrecking bug.Overall, the game is great. It is true it is in some aspects less deep than SimCity 4 and it does have some usability nuances (such as zoning not always looking exactly the way you want, though this is the price we pay for free-form orientation, I suppose), but it does so much stuff so great that you quickly let that pass. Traffic itself is so well done that it becomes a game unto itself (which is no wonder, considering the game was developed by the same people behind Cities in Motion).Modding support is also excellent. Though the base game comes with a somewhat limited variety of buildings, ten minutes in the Workshop will land you with several dozen new structures that will seamless integrate into your cities, and new stuff is being made faster than we can check it.Some of the missing stuff, such as tunnels, is already being considered as free DLCs in the near future.10/10 game. This is both the citibuilder we wanted and the citibuilder we deserved."

The citizens will ask for it when they need something without being too demanding.The simulation is very accurate.

Aligning roads is super tedious and no undo button. So it didn't appear quite how you wanted to? Too bad, tear it down and try again! No matter how hard you try to make a nice even grid there will always be gaps.Possibly the dumbest thing about this game... there is a twitter simulator build in that constantly chimes in with annoying comments that I can't figure out how to turn off.. only put a hat on it. wtf.Try to put a train station near existing roads and rail lines, I DARE YOU.Seriously I hate this game.

24,33.7,Not Recommended, January 26,207,"If I had to summarise Cities Skylines in one word, that word would be frustrating.I really wanted to love this game. A city builder surpassing the classic Sim Citys in both scope and detail. I've seen the wonderful things others have built, and I want to join in on the fun, but the game is just too frustrating. I've come back to the game a few times, each time thinking this time would be the time I really get into Cities Skylines. It has never happened.Just starting a city is an ordeal. Before you can start having fun you need to connect your city to the highway, which sounds simple, but if you're a perfectionist like me it's about the most frustrating experience you can have with a creative game. There's no way to connect your town's roads to the highway in a way that looks orderly without tearing most of the highway apart and rebuilding. It's a sysiphistic effort of demolishing and rebuilding roads just to get to the good parts. I've literally spent over an hour doing this multiple times.Placing roads is very finnicky, and getting them to curve the way you want is a skill I wasn't able to master despite putting hours of practice into it. I can consistently get a 90 degree turn, but that's it. Building a curved road feels like trying to sew while wearing oven mitts. I can get the broad strokes of it, but the details are seemingly impossible and require tons of tedious fiddling. Trying to get to parallel lanes of a highway an equal distance apart along a curved path is a nightmare. Even when they're striaght it's not as easy as it should be. And all this happens before I get into actually building my city.The worst part of road building is there's no universal grid to build on. It's great that you don't have to be confined to a grid, but having the option for a universal grid would make city planning much less frustrating, especially if the highways enetered on that gird. There is a sort of grid system, but it's based on existing roads only. You need to build a bunch of temporary roads to act as a square and ruler, then delete them later. If you want to roads on opposite sides of the map to be parallel, you have to build a giant road between them first. It doesn't sound so bad, but do these things hundreds of times in a row and it gets infuriating. The features for building roads in line with your existing roads have improved since I bought the game, but it's just not good enough.The bulldozer tool feels especially clumsy. There doesn't seem to be any way to drag a bounding box (probably because there's no grid). Just a series of clicks. You can sort of drag the mouse around, but it's unreliable. And you can only bulldoze one very short section of road at a time. Nodes along the roads are about two road widths apart, so when you build a long curved highway, but you don't like it, you must individually bulldoze a dozen separate segments. Again, and again. Why don't I just ctrl+Z and try again, you ask?THERE IS NO UNDO FUNCTION.This is the thing that ruins the experience for me more than anything else. Even MS Paint on Windows 95 let you undo three actions. I've heard there's an undo for terraforming, which is nice, but it doesn't help me when I accidentally demolished the middle section of a bridge. If you delete one segment in a long curved road, you may as well delete the rest and start over, because there's no easy way to get that road the way it was before. You'd think there'd be a built in tool to create a smooth continuous curve between two existing roads, but I haven't found one. Getting parallel bridges to have matching supports and uniform height takes considerably more work than it's worth. You can't even edit existing roads without mods.Speaking of mods, the game is far too dependent on them. For basic functions even. It's also much too dependent on user generated content in general. The default premade highway transitions will never have the lanes the same distance apart as the highways on your map. The game only comes with about a dozen maps. I understand the appeal of a whole steam workshop full of maps, but most of them suck. It's Sturgeon's Law. Even the good ones aren't going to be what you're looking for. They're all either too flat and dull or have such complicated topography that building a city in them is more like tetris than city building. Spending an hour browsing the workshop looking for the right map isn't something I want to do every time I start a new city, I just want to get to the fun part. There's just not enough content. Unless you want to scour the workshop for assets, every hospital in your city is going to look identical.I've seen people do amazing things with this game, but I just don't have their patience. This game is work.Bottom line, there's just too much in the way of having a fun experience. If the game ever gets a sequel with an undo function and a universal grid, I'll buy it day one. But until that happens, Cities Skylines isn't worth the tedium and repetition.I'd only recommend this game if you're okay building sloppy and like the simulation aspect, or are willing to put in an inordinate effort to do something creative.Ah, who am I kidding, I'll try to get into it again in a few months."

But the game was more than terrible, the citys where way to small, more bugs than you could count, the first 0,5-1 year there was no singleplayer option this way the servers keep crassing, etc.Then a few years later I heard all the good stories about Cities Skylines and I gave it a change, I'll never regret ths decision. Yes the grapics are terrible in comparison to Sim City, but the gameplay is way better; bigger cities, customizable maps, mods, and of course the steam workshop witch makes this good game a great game. I played this for over a 200 hours and I still love it as if it's the first time i'm playing the game."

598,212.9,Recommended," October 14, 2016",9,"Much as I like to give every distraction remain focused a chance to affirm, certain diversions request examinations. By ideals of Cities: Skylines, planner Colossal Order has obviously demonstrated its excitement after SimCity – not only the key thought and procedures for building and keeping up a duplicated city starting from the soonest arrange, yet a phenomenal part of the look and feel as well. In like manner, on fundamentally every check, Skylines considers insistently to the past driving figure of the city-building kind. It is, truly, the best of its kind to arrive in an entire decade – a remarkable, adaptable, staggering, and all-around marvelous reenactment that permits you to gather sprawling, single-player urban regions to your heart's substance. Building must be its own reward, regardless, in light of the way that the nonappearance of eccentric occasions or catastrophes leaves the control of running these towns feeling drained and wise.Having influence pioneer, part god-ruler with the ability to subjectively bulldoze your reenacted local people's fantasies and make schools with a tick, building a city with no arranging is for the most part standard: set down roads with the simple to-utilize contraptions, dispense zones for private, business, or mechanical structures, give utility associations, secure the cost help, then rehash the cycle with new stuff that has been opened by your making individuals hitting new points of view. Horizons finds an all things considered chipper medium between the multifaceted plan of SimCity 4 and the relative straightforwardness of SimCity 2013 by method for in this way adding zoneable zones to paths as they're laid, yet meanwhile getting a handle on mandatory busywork like laying water channels. Those stray pieces are all attempted and genuine - you couldn't have a city-design without them - so it's required that they be done well. Urban districts: Skylines does that.The crucial way this sim pounds it out of the excitement center is in its scale. Every preoccupation starts as misleadingly little, contracting you to a four-square-kilometer zone (a misty size from a SimCity design, by fortunes I'm certain), yet rapidly permits you to purchase access to a near to plot of place where there is vague size. By then it does this seven more times, for an aggregate conceivable space of 36 square kilometers. Suffice it to say, there's an extensive measure of room. Recalling that you can't especially modify space while you play, there's an included guide supervisor where you can make any land mass you pick before you skip in - or download one from the unmistakably combined Steam Workshop mod support.With such wide urban zones, it's extraordinary that Skylines licenses you to depict and organize runs exclusively. Basically paint a lump of your city with the District instrument, and you can not just name it so you can spot it effectively on the guide, however give it novel procedures that control everything from advising smoke locators to lessening fire dangers (at a cost) to supporting recreational prescription use for lower wrongdoing rates, or banning highrise structures to make depicted downtown and common zones. In mechanical zones, you can sharpen the relationship to misuse a guide's normal assets in the region to mine metal, enter for oil, create on rich land, or collect trees for officer advantage. You can even make constrain motivations for a particular kind of zone inside every zone.We ought to zoom in for a minute: we can see specific people strolling around the paths, going to work or school, sharing in beguilement works out, or returning home by the thousands. They drive autos, take arranges, and even walk pooches. (You can openly name them, yet I propose naming them Waldo, in light of the way that there are various to the point that in the event that you watch that particular one again you I say you essentially win.) This is the place you appreciate the time scale persuades the chance to be ludicrous. On the slowest speed a day endures 10 seconds – three and a half on the speediest – which deduces the excursion to work could most recent a week. Regardless, the nonattendance of a day and night cycle proposes time doesn't appear, in every way, to be an excessive amount of unnatural, however rather a reflection, making it hard to serve the speed at which things are made and charge exchange streams out.Mass travel is a sketchy savage. It's missing to set down transport stops and get prepared stations; you need to plot out courses freely, or nobody will go wherever. It's unquestionably not hard to lose all capacity to peruse a compass in that, particularly as courses begin covering and it's dumbfounding to get your vehicle stop set on the privilege half of each obliged street. Nevertheless, there are a considerable measure of choices, and the endorphin surge from making a red advancement information overlay turn green makes everything upheld, despite all the burden.Close, structures are awe inspiring and point by point, direct down to little improvements like housetop fans turning. A slider in the choices menu gives us control over the measure of essentialness of-field obscure connected with inaccessible structures when zoomed in, which mirrors SimCity's drawing in diorama influence. Horizons doesn't sort out the graphical method for SimCity, nevertheless, and given the goliath numbers we see them in they don't correctly have the assortment foreseen that would keep most neighborhoods from emitting an impression of being vague.More than anything, Cities: Skylines is about the crucial satisfaction in building. It's a truly magnificent and as regularly as would be prudent staggering reenactment, where a bewildering number of virtual individuals continue ahead over a huge swath of land. Getting in and making something is direct, however acing it will require wide research on social event wikis to comprehend why progression is vexed regardless of when you address your subjects' prominent concerns. Try not to expect strengthening conditions or sporadic occasions, yet do plan to be awed by the scale and different moving parts of this city-build.(All reviews are retrieved from the Internet and piped through a succession of synonym tools three times both for humour and to save time.

470,13.4,Recommended," March 16, 2017",9,"There’s a lot of tools and a lot to learn. Across the bottom of the screen is a toolbar that contains all the stuff you need to create your city. Initially there is only a limited selection for you to play with. As your population grows more tools become available and the pacing is just perfect.Features like global policies that can reduce power consumption or increase fire safety are introduced at a rate that never feels like a bombardment. The same goes for buildings and services. Rather than a sit down and read endless pop-ups style tutorial features are gradually introduced so that only small explanations are needed at each stage. It really lets you get hooked even during those often tedious early learning stages. Another reason Skylines is so fun straight from the start is that each and every tool you use is so effortless.There’s a zone system used that is very similar to everyone’s favourite Sim City game. But again the tools are there for you to make your life easy. Streets come ready equipped with grids attached that you can either paint one square at a time, use a paint brush tool or even a fill tool to create entire blocks easily. Then waiting just a little time everything comes to life as buildings are erected and citizens go about their daily lives.All this simplicity isn’t to imply that Skylines isn’t complex. Underneath the user friendly interface there are a set of menus and tables that reveal some of the numbers that lie beneath. Finances, happiness, healthcare, education, crime and transport are all detailed enough to make Skylines worthy of any city building fan.The only thing that some may not like is the slightly sandbox style, especially later in the game. Once the learning curve and introduction of tools is done with there are very little objectives to give you direction.- Cities offer room for expansion- Beautifully detailed miniature village style looks- introduction and learning curve- Great tool designed- Lack of objectivesDISASTER | BAD | MEDIOCRE | OKAY | GOOD | GREAT | | MASTERPIECE"

This game also earns a plus on a near flawless release(when compared to its competition), and I have confidence that it become more than what Sim City 4 had became, in less amount of time(Sim City 4 does have a decade+ of development).My only complaint, and it's merely opinion oriented, is I wish this game used a darker saturation for the color of its buildings and vehicles. I personally wish they would have used a similar color scheme as Cities in Motion 2(for realism). However, with the mod community, you are able to change this.

278,157.1,Not Recommended," November 29, 2016",54,"TLDR:The games as a whole feels unfinished, lacks proper tools and objects. Without mods its quite boring, and you fell like you don't have much to see here after 2 hours. Devs are lazy and greedy, releasing DLCs that costs a lot of money but don't change much, and they are basically relying on modders work. Every new DLC makes mods ""out of date"", and no longer usable.This is ridiculous - making life harder for people who actually make your product worth using.Don't get me wrong though - this is a very good game, but unmodified CS is far from perfect.Full story:Pros:+ great graphics;+ quite well optimised;+ unlimited replayability;+ making basic roads is fairly comfortable;+- water physics (acts weird sometimes, but overall works fine).Cons:- without mods allowing prop placement (such as More Beautification) your cities feel lifeless, and spaces between homes / businesses are empty, making them look ugly;- if you want your roads to look realistic, its nearly impossible to build them without such tools as Move it!, Precision Engineering and Road Anarchy;- without mod like IPT, controlling public transport is very basic, and thus not fun at all;- limited graphics configuration options;I keep saying mods, mods, mods... but just think about it - some VERY BASIC things in the game has to be improved by modders, just to operate ""smoothly"". For example, why don't we have an option in game menu to:1. Disable Chirper;2. To disable clouds / fog (especially important for lower end PCs);3. Building demoliton mechanic feels like its designed for tablet / smartphone game. Why do I have to demolish every burned or bankrupt building? They could just implement tickbox ""automatic demoliton"" in base game, if you like to move around your vast city and click like maniac, its your call;4. Placing props while playing, like in ingame object editor;5. Disable ugly pollution texture;I may sound rude, but in my personal opinion, modders make better job at keeping this game fun to play than devs. The game itself seems to be just a frame, designed to be improved by community with no effort of the company that made it."
59,67.3,Not Recommended," August 4, 2017",246,"There comes a time when you cannot ignore the big issues in the game and after dealing with them for so long it really makes you think if this game is really worth your time and money.Price tag 27,99€All DLC(s) more than 40€It loves to milk you for stuff that should've already been in the game.When you first start out its all fun games until you reach a certain population and you start to encounter the random bugs.One of the most annoying game breaking bugs that hasn't been patched yet (I don't think it will ever be patched either) is ""Garbage has piled up"" and ""dead person waiting for transport"", Even if you have 50 cemeteries and Landfills there will only be about 2-4 Hearses/Trucks out of 15-20 that will be used even if you bump up the budget for healthcare and garbage disposal.(Has nothing to do with road condition or accessibility)(It randomly starts happening then doesn't stop until you restart Cities Skylines, same with the other bugs, you have to restart but it doesn't always work)(There is a ""FIX"" for the ""dead person waiting for transport"" (and it's hardly a fix) the key is to not to zone to many homes and buildings at the same time or the so called ""Deathwave"" will come and ruin your city, but there is a huge con to that and that is slow growth, really slow growth)If you've made it through the Garbage and Cemetery bugs then just wait, You have some more challenges just right ahead, Crime and Fires will go up if you have traffic jams (Not avoidable unless you fix your traffic, which btw most of the time is not possible) and if that wasn't enough then here comes the artillery, Sick citizens, cause? sound of traffic even if they live in a skyscraper or in a area with roads that have trees for the soul purpose to damp the sound from the cars and trucks passing by, but it can't even do that right.And lets not forget the traffic problems, oh lord the traffic problems..For some odd reason cars only drive on one lane at the highway which creates a massive huge pileup of cars and problems with goods not being delivered or recieved. (HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH EXITS BEING ON THAT SIDE)Those are the biggest game breaking bugs in the game but lets go to the head scratchers.You can put the taxes up to 29% but everyone is going to complain and as far as i know its not possible to go more than 18% even if the land value is up the roof and everyone is happy.Your citizens will always complain.Water physics, yea they don't exist and dont get me started on building a hydro power plant, just dont do it or you will 100% drown your city because water is wet and dogs say woof.Now to the performance part.The graphics are MEH compared to Sim City but for some reason the game runs slower, I believe it's becuase of bad optimization but im not sure, Im not alone with this problem as alot of other people are having the same issues even though they have better PC's than me.I start to suffer at a population of 20k with a maximum of 50 fpsAnd at a population of 400k thats when we are talking 20 fps maxNot will you just take a performance hit but the time will go slower and progress will ""stall""(It won't actually stall but it will take longer for stuff to respond to the changes you've made)My setup: i5-6600k (3.80GHz) with a Sapphire RX480 Nitro+ (8GB) with 16 GB of LPX Vengance RAM (3200MHz)So to wrap this up by saying, this is just a tiny portion of the bugs i've encountered but there still is alot more but these bugs stand out the most to me, Would i recommend this game, at the current price HECK NO, but i would recommend waiting for a discount then get it i guess, but only if you're ready to face everything i've mentioned and alot more.EDIT: I was wrong, it wasn't just 40€+ it was '79,91€ Add all DLC to Cart'"

Knowing we will get flooded with new content, patches, mods and whatnot, this is Christmas for gamers addicted to city builders and simulation games. It was easy to learn, fun to plan, not as easy as it looks, you always want more, it's a toxic sleep killer. Finally we have a real successor to 2003's SimCity4 with a lot of similarities. As if SC4 was now Cities Skylines (the policies, the districts, the neighbor plots, etc). Oh and I'm able to play on my 2 year old laptop, without a hickup, it played well instantly. This is a winner and the game will be even better down the road. Don't even hesitate to buy this game."

Well here goes:Road capacity in Truro (Cornwall) is really bad.Cities Skylines solution: Use the road upgrade tool to widen road or make road one way. Traffic flow improves, tax revenue improves and happieness increases.Local council solution: Remove a lane and make it a bus lane! Traffic gridlock, buses cant get to bus lane due to traffic, happieness decreases, business revenue decreases, then council scraps bus lane at a cost of £60k.If only they had played this game maybe they could have got it right............."

The designers added extras (some free, some to buy), which added more content, more scenarios, and improved the gameplay.What is also fantastic: is the workshop - here many dozens of players have added their own content: ""Mods"", which enhance the game. ""Assets, like buildings, trains, trees, beach huts, the Big Ben .. whole Brooklyn neighbourhoods. You name it , it is probably there.

All this stuff is just to much. I am older and do not like to be nickle'ed and dimmed to death. I grew up in a generation of games when 1 X-Pack contained all the stuff listed in the DLC for this game. I bought After Dark and then Snowfall, they were not worth it and I regret doing that. It looks like their publisher Paradox has a DLC fixation with all games under their umbrella. I suggest buying the standalone game and just use the community for mods. I cannot recommend this game based on the current traffic lane problems & routing which have not been addressed. You can make a road parallel to another road going to the same place in the same direction and one road will be jammed the other will be empty. SC4 is still the champ."

46,243.0,Not Recommended," December 4, 2016",87,"My first week I was very into Cities:Skylines. But then I quickly realized this game is not a city sim or even city builder/designer game. No, its pure traffic sim. You will lose yourself for hours trying to fix the idiotic AI that is Cities:Skylines traffic.Drivers will only drive in the center lane near an exit ramp. This creates chaos. They will come to a dead stop with two other clear lanes but no one will drive in the other lanes. I'm convinced this is not by design, but a bug due to poor AI. Why have six lanes or a three lane highway if the sims are not going to utilize the lanes during heavy traffic. Also, a town of 50,000 is not going to have enough population or demand to clog up a 3 lane one way highway(total of six lanes), let alone the 2 connecting highways on my map, and then a third highway I built.To add to this chaos, garbage collectors, cops, firemen, hearst drivers, etc, do not stay in their own area. They will abandon their area and go clog your highways while your citizens near the service home suffer. There is no AI to make them only stay in their area. Even if you have every area covered they will still go across your map.The only challenge to this game is making an entire city with no traffic stops - nothing else is a challenge. Even with well executed roundabouts you're still going to have extreme highway challenges that all orginate from 1) too much traffic being spawned despite a low population, 2) poor AI because sims do not utilize highways correctly. At first, I found it fun to try and beat the traffic, until I realize I've spent hours on it, and have noticed the sims erratic, pointless driving. Its just poor AI. I'm sure there are other traffic sims that have proper AI, not that I even wanted a traffic sim, I was hoping for a city builder/designer. So, unless you want a frustrating traffic sim game, with a bity of city builder thrown in I would say only get this if its on sale. And do not bother with the overpriced DLC. If they fix the traffic AI, then it'd be a fun little game.Also, another unrealistic aspect is you can follow a car, and in good traffic it will take this car days to reach its destination. In bad traffic it will take weeks... C'mon. Regardless, just a poor traffic sim game."

363,46.9,Recommended," June 25, 2016",8,"Cities: Skylines is currently the best city building simulator. It sure isn't difficult but extremely fun. The game has so much content to offer so just let your imagination do the rest and build your own dream city. Besides, if you want to add even more variety you're always free to download mods and assets from the steam workshop. Things like unique buildings, props, vehicles and other additions will enhance your gaming experience by a huge amount. In my opinion, I'd say that the game isn't perfect but you can make it near-perfect by using different mods to fill the gaps. For example, the traffic management is so tricky and poor that sometimes you feel like playing traffic simulator but with the help of mods you can solve this problem much easier.The maps are enormous and can be increased in size even more via mods. It may take dozens or more hours to finish the city, especially, if you're making it look pretty and pay attention to small details and not just the population. Speaking of details, the game looks polished in high-up view and even while you're zoomed in all the way (or using first person camera mod).I've been nagging about mods the whole review, meaning, that the incorporation of workshop was the best approach to make this game by far the best city building simulator that you can currently get.

The graphics are very good and the game itself is amazing, it's such a well executed game! It costs a lot but in some sales it goes down to arond£9.00, you can get it cheaper online though. Its very good as it doesn't force you to do anything, on your first city it gives you tips but in general they just leave you alone to play! Its quite realistic and has lots of ideas which you can relate to in the place you live. The new snowfall expansion is sounding very promising, released on 18 february! The after dark expansion is great, it doesn't add much for the price but adds a new element by adding the prison and taxi service. btw the after dark expansion doesn't add the day and night cycle, its already on the game. (it advertises this on its page!) I especially like trying to control the traffic as it is difficult to keep it flowing; if your traffic flows your city flows!

259,226.9,Recommended," October 25, 2016",3,"Picking up in a world where good city builders are far and inbetween, Cities Skylines has a lot to offer. Much of the complaints about Sim City 2013, world size, always online drm, limited modding, are one of the top selling points of this game. This game has a massive moding community with not only tons of vehicles and buildings, but also gameplay altering mods that change how traffic behaves, adds more roads, and so much more. This game is a great addition to the city building genre, but there are some critisisms in mind that I wish this game did better. The challenge in this game is often lacking, once you build up any kind of positve cash flow, the game turns into a city painting simulator with minimal management necessary. I also wish the game handeled some aspects of it more like Sim City 2013. Education in Cities Skylines tweaks how often sims burn down their house, and what jobs they tend to go to. In Sim City, education would make industrial zones cleaner, people wealthier, and more, along with with Cities Skylines already has. At the end of the day, both games have their stengths and weaknesses, Sim City has a stronger city manager game, and Cities Skylines is a great tool for people to sculpt their perfect cities with ease."
294,675.5,Recommended," June 24, 2017",3,"Beautiful, addictive and enjoyable city building experience. Or as someone once put it, a traffic management game with a city building side-quest. Although fully matured, it's still in active development, with free updates every year and DLC packs which really add a lot to the graphics, gameplay and features.Reading the other reviews, there's some dissent among players about the cost of DLC. As a developer myself, I can confirm that we do need money to feed our families and pay our mortgages.But even without DLC, the base game is the best of its kind anywhere, and good enough that you don't really need the extras."

BUY IT!There's no way an ordinary♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥is going to write a review to top Mayor Todd's, so, instead of the usual review that compares this game directly to similar games, here is a list of some fun things you can do in this game:1) Play offline, with a smooth framerate and a sensible interface2) Build beautiful, sprawling 3D cities (rather than 2D grids or absurdist skyscraper hamlets), and view them with a few different color palettes3) Get Steam achievements4) Follow individual cars, trucks, buses, trains, and airplanes fromorigin point to destination5) Micromanage public transportation, as in OpenTTD (which is free, btw.)6) Build or download highway interchanges, with ramps, bridges, and tunnels (like the double-paperclip interchange)7) Watch as trucks pile up in one lane of a six-lane road, causing fury and hair-tearing on your part(this is one of the few cons)8) Build ultra-modernist, utopian phalansteries that would make Le Corbusier proud9) Build facsimiles of older, Southern European cities (using ""European-style"" maps)10) Join the urban farming movement, only to watch your semi-realistic gravel roads get clogged with absurd numbers of tractors11) Cause disease due to sewage contamination, floods that disable buildings, and floods of contaminated sewage that causes disease and disables buildings, thanks to improper water management (water physics in this game are somewhat believable)12) Build a surfeit of fire stations, incinerators, and crematoria (or watch your people suffer)13) Build OP monuments that give massive amounts of electricity, universal (cheap) health care, universal (cheap) education, huge land value increases, and other crazy benefits, after torturing your city to meet arbitrary/sadistic production requirements (e.g., health care satisfaction under 20%)14) See a whole bunch of generic Scandinavian buildings and vehicles that kind of look like they came from a kid's train set15) Speaking of train sets, this game lets you set up digital dioramas involving trains and transportation, and view them with Simcity 2013-style tilt shift shader (don't worry, you can turn it off if you don't like it)16) Make your own maps and interchanges using the built-in tools (or decorate existing buildings)17) Rename people, houses, businesses, and districts (or, for that matter, abuse eminent domain) to get the perfect ""feel""18) Make your own hiking trails and place trees manually along them for aesthetics19) Build huge, attractive residential zones, only to find that, forty years later, all the people there get old and die, thus overburdening your deathcare system, which spreads disease, which causes more death, which causes economic collapse, which causes industries to fail, which causes commercial zones to whine about not having goods or customers, which causes power outages when you bulldoze the commercial zones, which cause all the remaining citizens to pack up and leave.20) Spend 100 hours straight building one city, and forget about your family, your school, your job, and your overheating graphics card (until the game crashes and you lose your city... NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!)1) Play offline, sometimes with a choppier framerate2) Build even more beautiful cities, using EVEN MORE SPACE, and view them with a variety of different shader effects (such as ambient occlusion, edge detection à la Borderlands, ""godrays,"" and Dynamic Resolution)3) NOT get Steam achievements (unless you install another mod)4) Follow individual vehicles with a first-person view--and, for a greater challenge, reduce their speeds to make for realistic traffic congestion levels5) Micromanage public transportation a bit more (including dedicated bus roads, bypass passenger stations, public parking garages...)6) Build even better highway interchanges, with better lane controls (seriously, I've spent hours doing this)7) No mods to fix this one yet, though some help mitigate it8) Build post-modernist tract housing (à la suburban America), brutalist slums/housing projects, British row houses, and trailer parks (or ""caravan clubs,"" for you Brits out there)9) Build insane skyscrapers that tower unrealistically over pieds-a-terre and hipster-infested coffee shops, and then surround them with statues of evil hamsters and giant blobs of metal10) Make farms that kind of look like farms11) Cause tsunamis and massive floods12) This one's still a problem; why can't one or two crematoria be enough?!13) Build community-designed monuments that may, or may not, be overpowered14) Download tons of vehicles and growable buildings from the Workshop (from Coca-Cola trucks to Winnebago RV's to -esque shanties, complete with Nuka-Cola machines), and spice up your roads15) Did I mention that are available on the Steam Workshop?16) Make buildings, mods, etc., and upload to Steam Workshop (for more adventurous types)17) Clone growable buildings to get the perfect aesthetic (believe me, this is cooler than it sounds)--or, better yet, place individual props yourself18) Make your own hiking trails, place trees with Tree Brush, and hike the aforementioned trails19) Do that, but without the incessant Chirpy tweets of ""#movingout.""20) Spend 150 hours building your city; run into 65,536 object limit in game after getting to a population over 200,000...

62,99.7,Recommended," September 4, 2016",3,"95 hours of gameplay and I have only one city that is thriving. I almost reached to 100k people yet there is alot more to do. The achievement system, in my opinion, is great. For example, after increasing your population by, lets say 5000 people, new buildings unlock. These buildings help you build even a bigger city. To be honest though, it's slow and boring in the beginning. You can buy new square lands and increase the size of your city as your population is increasing. The economy isn't as hard as it is in SimCity so you can easily gain money. My only complaint is that you cannot buy all of these lands but fortunately there is a mod that can allow you to do that. Also, there aren't natural disasters but now they will soon add it as you can see from the DLC list! Can't wait for it!Enjoy and have fun building your own city!*Hint*: Use underground highway tunnels and roundabouts and connect them to another roundabout on the ground level so your traffic wont be so jammed. Also, dont make intersections so close to each other so there wont be frequent jams."
31,135.7,Recommended," June 6, 2016",3,"The best description of this game is a ""City Sandbox"" than as a city simulator. You'll notice many people who really love the game love design and have felt hampered by requirements imposed by other city games. If you are looking for a realistic simulation then this isn't for you. Unless you are talking about traffic. Road network flow is actually quite accurate and you can spend hours trying to figure out how to design a proper road system, or how to mess it up.The game is beautiful, the cities are fun to build, playing with the water tool is fun, seeing each simulated character using your transit system is emjoyalbe. All opinions, mind.The biggest drawback for this game is probably the lack of difficulty/accurate simulation. If you are looking for something that attempts to respond as a real city, you won't find it here. Basically, the game is very very forgiving. I've been able to get almost every achievement on my vanilla starter town, even the hard 'evil mayor' ones. In fact, the largest difficulty I've had involved getting everyone sick to get the landmark, then building extra hospitals and buldozing half the city's polluted water supply to try and get back afloat. All admidst my population dropping to about 1/8 of what it was. Coming back was really hard but also really fun. There is potential for things to be difficult, but you usually have to make it yourself.Same with an accurate simulation. You can't reinact Pittsburgh by cutting the school budget to pay for a football stadium and see the uneducated aftermath - in fact all education in this game seems unreal to me. People are happy with water, power, and a job. It is a difficulty figuring out how to make them unhappy! Again, it's a city sandbox. The game tries really hard not to force anything on you. I think there are pros and cons to this method, but this game is good at what it sets out to do.Tons of mods. Not everything can be changed but much can, which is really fun. I'm planning to learn some C# to edit some things about this game, and possibly add more depth to the simulation.TL;DR, when making your decision, remember:City Sandbox not City Simulatorand make your decision based off of that.8/10"

However, there are a few things I would like to mention.I have encountered a bug where dead people are not being picked up and taken to a grave or crematorium, just left where they are, even if said facilities are nearby.It would be nice if you could make it so you can fit small paths between houses so you don't have to destroy them. Plus, if a path or road being placed would change the housing setups, it should say. Normally it does but sometimes it will distort the road causing some houses to be destroyed.It would also be good if parks could be custom build, such as drawing them into holes within groups of housing, and gaining access to these parks with the better paths mentioned earlier.Last of all, but also probably of least importance, who expects you to provide your own cities power; there should be a way to plug into the national grid.Despite these, I have really enjoyed playing, and I plan to continue doing so. Well done on the great game!"

Also the game itself looks nice and offers a good usability for players. The interface looks nice and most things in the game are already balanced.But now to the greatest part about this game: It's going to get further developed with and even a chance on which would mean that SimCity is going to be completely useless.With an growing community and even an subreddit ( ) this game is a great start for game industrie into the new year 2015."

372,207.6,Recommended," March 15, 2015",3,Although I haven't played that many city builders this one is definitely the best I've played so far. It's making me spend too much time playing it when I should be doing other things....Extremely enjoyable and the modding support just makes it even better. This game has a big future.
260,85.1,Recommended," March 14, 2015",3,"I keep calling this game SimCity inadvertently. No, not in reference to the misfire from 2013. Instead this game brings me back to the kind of fun I had playing the SimCity games of the past.Five days in after buying the game and I'm st ill building my first city. After spending 18 hours (eep) I've expanded its borders as far as it will go, I've built a couple of the big unlockables, and I see no reason to stop with this city for now.There are issues with the game but it's phenominally good fun, intuitive, pretty good looking (even if not as polished as SimCity '13) and most important of all: there are no gamebreaking issues. This is the best citybuilder in over a decade, and it continues the genre in fine tradition.Back to the issues...It could use more anti aliasing and the tilt-shift effect isn't as good as SimCity '13s. These are minor quibbles.Road traffic doesn't seem to effectively use all lanes but once you learn some tricks to laying out your roads you can mitigate some of the traffic issues. In this regard it's still better than SimCity '13.Rail traffic seems to be the wonkiest thing I've encountered. Trains keep getting jammed up and stopping without any clear indication of where they're trying to go. I may have made mistakes in laying out the tracks and stations so I'm still trying to figure out if this is something I've caused but something just feels off.Dealing with dead bodies and trash takes some getting used to, traffic can hold up their removal (and police, ambulances and firetrucks). Abandoned buildings are also a bit of a nuisance because you are encouraged to bulldoze them, but they also seem to take care of themselves if there's demand for growth (they'll get torn down and rebuilt automatically). That said leaving them up if there's not demand reduces the happiness/land value of the immediate area so bulldozing is a good idea unless they turn around quickly.TLDR: This game is $30, awesome fun, works great, active and extensive modding community. BUY IT!"

The ability to create your own parks/buildings/etc, Great modding support. Map 9x bigger than SimCity 2013 (potentially bigger with mods!).This game is awesome. A few minor things I would like to see improved (easier planting of trees in clusters instead of one at a time, as an example.

I can safely say this 30$ game will keep me occupied for years to come with it's immensly large building areas which can be even further enhanced with mods. The custom maps, one which I found for Portland Maine. Which I frequently visit, inspire me to create themed masterpieces. Or I could just make a city in the shape of a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥....

219,83.0,Recommended," March 11, 2015",3,"Surprisingly solid and refined game that is fun, has depth and feels very accessible. Lots of stuff to dig into, especially considering the price.The game is not perfect (a bit on the easy side, lack of building variety, needs some events and/or disasters to break up the later game a bit), but still lots of fun - and mods already start addressing some of the problems and the developers are already promising free content patches.Even in its current state, it's well worth the price of admission and a good city builder, the future potential is just the extra cherry on top."

Great game, nothing annoying, no complaints."
185,19.7,Recommended," March 16, 2015",3,"Fantastic game!Anyone who's played SimCity before will have an idea what to expect here. Start out with a small town town, slowly build it up, generate funds and expand your city. The game is immersive straight off the bat, with a gental learning curve. It's the sort of game that will suck you right in, with hours going by without you noticing it. You'll spend your day thinking about modifications you're going to make when you get home. It's really that good.The game works by permitting development through the zoning of land. Different zones will permit different kinds of development. It's all held together by a road network (and later on a subway/train/plane network) that you'll constantly have to plan for and tweak. Services such as sewerage, water, electricity as well as services such as garbage, police, firefighters, ambulances, morgues, parks and education are all accounted for. It's a game of balance, a bit of that here a bit of that there. As the City grows, the game rewards you with more zones, services, buildings, etc, slowly dripping you the goodies as you progress rather than overwhelming you at the start.The game is super accessible, and whilst punishing earlier on, is rather easy once the ball gets rolling. My girlfriend had a go and succsesfully set up a city on her own.Whilst the game is super amazing, like every game it has it's minor problems. There is a lack of an endgame. Once you hit a certain point, it feels almost like a last section of the game is missing. Super high residential, mega-matropolis expansion pack please, with plenty more features! Furthermore, whilst I view the easy difficulty as a positive, many will feel the lack of challenge once the money starts to roll in. Roads play an important part of the game, but feel very volatile and hit/miss when placing them in complicated patterns. I feel like these things will likely be addressed over time as the game matures and mods set in. The workshop is already looking plentiful despite a recent release.Must-buy game, definately will be top 3 games of the year, especially with all this AAA+ trash that gets released these days."
303,52.8,Recommended," March 15, 2015",3,"Very enjoyable game, 4.5/5 or 9/10.+Nice enough graphics give enough realism.+Zoning works well with fill, square or circle.+Hundreds if not thousands of models so even the tiniest zones can be filled.The negatives are mostly nitpicks, but it must be brought to the attention of you, the reader.-Motorways/Highways. So if you have traffic backing up onto a motorway, why do people who do not want to come off there stay in the 1st lane? I'm sorry, but you are an idiot if you sit in lane 1 in a queue waiting to come off at a later point.-General traffic flow. As a Brit, I set it so traffic travels on the left, but it applies to both. If you're on the outside trying to turn to the outside, and they are on the inside trying to turn to the inside, YOU CAN BOTH GO AT THE SAME TIME!-Six lane roads. Similarly to above, traffic in lanes 2 and 3 stop if someone wants to join lane 1. Just use One Way 2 Lane roads, they work much more effectively. Also, if you have a road joining to head northbound, it does not interrupt southbound.-Roundabouts. Everything about them. As above, people in lane 2 wait for someone coming into lane 1. Traffic annoyance.-Proximity. Again, these are nitpicks, but they need to be sorted. If you have your 9 2x2km chunks all in a line and have services (for example, ambulance) at both ends, why do the ambulance drivers from one end even consider crossing through the busiest city in this instance of game to help someone with a cold at the other side? I have caught ambulance drivers crossing over 3 chunks of land to get to a midly ill patient when the patient lives NEXT DOOR TO A HOSPITAL! We need proximity priority!As I said, these are nitpicks. However, when you want to create a well-planned city and the only thing dragging it down is the fact that people can't go from left to left and right to right on the same junction at the same time, causing the entire motorway to clog up all the way out of your city boundries, it's rather annoying.I would still recomend the game though, because it's just plain damn fun. Let's not forget the game is still in early access and even if this guide is putting you off buying, get it none the less so the devs can fix the bugs earlier!"

If you liked Cities XXL but wished it wasn't so flaky and unstable, this is for you. It takes the best bits from recent City builder sims and pieces them together to make a really enjoyable experience, if you've played this type of game before you'll feel right at home almost immediately. But even if you haven't, you'll pick up the basics in no time. It's not perfect, no, but the devs have many plans for the future and support seems very good, unlike the Cities XL games."

100,284.8,Recommended," March 11, 2015",3,"Excellent!. Ive extensively played every single Simcity that came out with at least 100 hours on each title. Up to 400 on SC2000 and about the same on SC4, except SC2013 which was, after playing 4 hours, so worthless that i ditched it.I have been playing quite alot now, mainly working on 1 city and changing/altering it and trying out new things inside it.It is a great city builder!It looks good, feels good and plays good. The interface is neat and intuitive.Some people whine about having to place electric cables and sewage/waterpipelines.... i love it! Finally its back, i have to build a network of pipelines and cables to make sure that electricity and water comes around properly. What SC2013 did was ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, you lay down roads and automatically there power and water? give me a break.The only thing i kinda miss is some more depth in the economics, those feel a bit flat and shallow. The districtpolicies-system tries to adjust that but gives only few options and isnt satisfying enough (for me).Colossal Order does a great job already at bugfixing and is actively involved and interested in making their game even better. This is their 3rd title and also their biggest. A title that they claim is something theyve always dreamt of making so the support from them is expected to be big, especially with over 500.000 copies sold so far and rising.Other than that, this game comes right next to SC4 and thus becomes its only true heir.Job very well done by Colossal Order and Paradox.A must-have for any city-building afficionado, its pricing is excellent.

62,99.7,Recommended," September 4, 2016",3,"95 hours of gameplay and I have only one city that is thriving. I almost reached to 100k people yet there is alot more to do. The achievement system, in my opinion, is great. For example, after increasing your population by, lets say 5000 people, new buildings unlock. These buildings help you build even a bigger city. To be honest though, it's slow and boring in the beginning. You can buy new square lands and increase the size of your city as your population is increasing. The economy isn't as hard as it is in SimCity so you can easily gain money. My only complaint is that you cannot buy all of these lands but fortunately there is a mod that can allow you to do that. Also, there aren't natural disasters but now they will soon add it as you can see from the DLC list! Can't wait for it!Enjoy and have fun building your own city!*Hint*: Use underground highway tunnels and roundabouts and connect them to another roundabout on the ground level so your traffic wont be so jammed. Also, dont make intersections so close to each other so there wont be frequent jams."

If you have your 9 2x2km chunks all in a line and have services (for example, ambulance) at both ends, why do the ambulance drivers from one end even consider crossing through the busiest city in this instance of game to help someone with a cold at the other side? I have caught ambulance drivers crossing over 3 chunks of land to get to a midly ill patient when the patient lives NEXT DOOR TO A HOSPITAL! We need proximity priority!As I said, these are nitpicks. However, when you want to create a well-planned city and the only thing dragging it down is the fact that people can't go from left to left and right to right on the same junction at the same time, causing the entire motorway to clog up all the way out of your city boundries, it's rather annoying.I would still recomend the game though, because it's just plain damn fun. Let's not forget the game is still in early access and even if this guide is putting you off buying, get it none the less so the devs can fix the bugs earlier!"

308,53.9,Recommended," March 10, 2015",3,"I have only played a few hours of this, but its the most impressive city builder I have played since Sim City 4. This is what hard-core fans of the city building genre have been looking for since Sim City 4.Gameplay: 8.5/10The gameplay is fun and addictive with a focus towards solving challenges with road systems and infastracture being the core element of the game as-well as being creative, its a very relaxing and fun task to build your city up and never seems to get boring. The weaknesses is its depth, the game does everything well but doesnt excel in any areas in particular.Graphics: 8/10The graphics are very pretty and defiantly up to 2014 standard. It lacks proper anti-aliasing in some areas and I found the blur filter overwhelming in areas.Sound:The sound is very well done and I have no complaints about this."

345,131.3,Recommended," September 28, 2016",3,"Cities: Skylines is without a doubt the best city builder/simulator to date. Just imagine all of the other city builders/simulators you've played now combine the best parts and you get this, plus more.What I liked:User Interface- All of the menus and tooltips are very polished and very legible. Extremely easy to use. Simple in overall design, it won't overwelm you.Great Population Simulation- The simulation is very percise especially when it comes to street traffic. It also exists litterally its not just numbers/math in the background. You can see and track whats occurring in the simulation, The combined functions of health, education, police, etc work extremely well and effect the population with the most realisism in the genre. Funding litterally affects performance by limiting say a hospitals actual resources less ambulances, less beds, less doctors has effects that you can really see in the whole simulation. Traffic effects the performance of all elements the use roads. As resources are litterally transported in vehicles and the longer it takes for them to get there stops functionailty of other systems.Well Balanced Population Needs- The creation and coverage of services/leisure correctly influence the land value and allow the population to upgrade its businesses and homes in a detailed and sensible fashion.Excellent Power and Water Grid Simulation- When not enough water/electricity is being generated the furtherest structures based on the distance of connections through other building and powerlines/pipes are the building effected by it. Meaning that the grid actually exists rather then just being production minus requirement.Procedural Appearance/Connections- There is no grid that strictly defines where structures and roads are built. Instead you can draw curved roads that have correct appearances. Building built on curves will connect visually to the nearby structures and roads accurately. Intersections and changes to road types merge well.Policies- you can have global policies and specific policies. You can mark your own custom areas for the specific policies. Many of the policies actually have useful effects that also are shown in the overall simulation.Information Views- Selecting a service in the menus or specifically activating the contextual informative view has a complete full 3-D and statistcal analysis that is easy to understand.Dynamic WeatherTerraforming- The tools for changing the ground itself are also easy to use and the terrain has a very detailed mesh so hills, etc look very smooth.Water Physics - The water bodies actually feature flowing water. Terraforming and Canals will manipulate water flow. You can flood your city. This is also import when it comes to building dams as water has a rate of flow based on the terrain its flowing through.City Specializations- Resources are fully simulated. As in they are not extracted for a single purpose/objective. Normal industry actually needs the materials to function. Industry will either import resources from outside of your city or get it from within your city. Resources can only be found in certain areas in the map or not at all. When you create industry zones over a resource they will need to be specilized using the policy zones. When you've picked say agriculture the industry zones will become farms. The farms performance depends on the quality of the area. The normal industry and commercial structures will use generated resources. If you produce more than your city needs the goods will be exported out of the city.Continuing Development- The game is being expanded upon through dlc paid content and some free patches. Getting seasons gameplay is a paid dlc while the canals and terraforming were added for free. The paid dlc adds seasons, new Night related simulations with new commercial options, and a new public transportation option. The free patches added; road conditions and servicing, dynamic weather, terraforming and canals, stadiums, custom themes and other specific buildings. Do remember if we want to see more in the game they can't do the work for free.Mod Support- Mods are fully supported allowing quite substantial changes. Some could be considered cheating, but for the most part many of them are graphical changes and upgrades. The most useful Mods that are not cheating are very helpful. Things like deeper traffic analysis and tracking, Manual road Intersection options, custom road speed limits, protractors for drawing roads, along with many others. Many of the things missing from the vanilla game can be found as mods as well as nicer graphics to change up the look of things.Things I disliked:Engine Bottleneck- Eventually you will have such a large city that the simulation will become to much to process. Observing the hardware however the engine is making full use of the processor. Your maximum city size without taking a performance hit is determined by your processor bottlenecking if you don't have a good one, but eventually you will start losing performance regardless.Performance/Graphics- The graphics are okay, but when you start getting a lot of structures in your city. The graphics card usage gets unreasonably high for what you get. Your maximum city size without taking a performance hit is determined by when your graphics card bottlenecks. The default appearance of the game colour wise is very dull. Theme mods get you past this.Broken Tourism- After Dark has rendered tourism useless and even without After Dark seems to have very little useful functionality. This has been the case for quite a while now.Final Summary:The developers are releasing patches to optimize the engine along with new features. Optimization aside you will still find the game very playable. Even with broken tourism its still a lot better then the competitors in its current state. I'm sure you won't regret supporting the games further additions and fixes if you pick it up today.(I will remove or change the negatives if they are resolved)"
467,51.4,Recommended," September 12, 2016",3,"Cities: Skylines is much better than vanilla SC4 or SC3000 and even better than SC4 with NAM and other mods. Here's why:1. Skylines' has truly amazing moddability - there are quite a few really nice mods out there, especially ones that deal with transport - with them you can create and manage different bus, metro and tram lines, manage road signs, speed limits, traffic lights, signs, and much more. You can even manually control the traffic lights to prevent congestions. I can spend quite a lot of time doing just that.2. Other cool mods involve first person view, automatic buldozzing of abandoned buildings, SC4 and SC3000 music, building themes, and a cool mod that allows you to place different props on the map.3. It's more stable than heavily modded SC4. I rarely have any crashes, even with hundreds of addons.4. The graphics are way better, no competition here. I really like the oldschool look of SC4, and I even enjoy SC3000 every now and then, but this is something different. And better in my opinion.5. You can check every citizen in your city and see where he or she lives, works, and what his or her current destination is. The city really feels alive thanks to this.6. Pathfinding is really good - routes that citizens take are logical and there is nothing like in the newest SimCity where sims prefered dirt road to a highway if the route was shorter.7. There are many different buildings available, especially with addons, and they also have many additional elements to provide more variety - mainly different ads on the buildings.8. Healthcare also includes deathcare in this game which is a nice touch.9. I like the soccer (football) feature - you have a stadium and your team has the higher chance to win the more spectators will arrive - which obviously depends largely on how well you can organize the public transportation.10. There are quite a few laws to customize your approach to different things, such as drugs or penalties for criminals, although I hope that there will be more of those in the future.11. There are many, many different vehicles that you can download - cars, buses, planes, trains - anything you want. It looks great to see many real-world brands in there.Now to cons - there aren't many of them and nothing frustrating, but I think there are some:1. I liked that in SC4 you could create a whole megalopolis with many cities interconnected. In Cities: Skylines with proper mods you can build a rather large city, but you won't be able to build a multi-million metropolis.2. Buildings seem to have way too few households, even with mods that are supposed to provide a more realistic number. Perhaps this was necessary for the sake of balance or whatnot, but cities in SC4 seemed more realistic in this regard.Overall - if you want a decent city-builder, look no further. This is the best game for you."

It took me a while to get used to this game and actually started to play this game ""right,"" although I don't think there is a right way to play this game, because in the end it's really your choice how the city will turn out in the end. I really recommend this game, because it doesn't really hold your hand throughout the game, so therefore you are not restricted at the start of the game.

254,97.5,Not Recommended," August 17, 2017",529,"I would recommend this game if the company behind it didn't try to milk DLC so much. A majority of the DLC they released should have just been included in the base game or in free updates. I can't support a game with such a bad business model.I certainly enjoyed this game but I got more enjoyment out of free mods than any of the DLC they have released. This game is just not worth its asking price when you include DLC, not even close.If the base game had included the DLC as updates I would completely say it's worth the price, but it's just not.Still a great sim, just milked by a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ company. So if money isn't a problem for you, great buy it. If you worry about money like most people you might find it hard to fork up $15 so you can have lights and tourism. Both things that should be in any city sim.Just buy the base game and wait to buy the DLC when it's on sale, In it's entirety it's not the worth the price."
48,25.0,Not Recommended," April 6, 2016",79,"Cities Skylines is not so much of a game as it's a sandbox in which you can build a city.Granted, there is a lot you can build, and the city is very soon very beautiful. The problem is: there's no challenge. Sure, there are the usual problems with traffic, but any of those problems are made by the player, not that the game tosses a wrench into the machinery. You don't even have the usual problems with pollution or disgruntled people, because as long as there is a pretty even mix between industry, residential and commercial zones with a park or two placed, no one will ever be unhappy - I even got a prize for the most beautiful city, and I didn't even aim for that - I just plonked down a couple of parks.The graphics is fantastic, the music fine and the sounds... kind of annoying, especially the sirens that you will hear a lot. There are no bugs that I can think of, so technically speaking, this is an awesome game, but only if you don't want to be challenged, just building a city. And for me, that doesn't cut it."

102,9.4,Not Recommended," January 26, 2017",63,"I feel very rude and it frustrates me to write this, but I do not recommend Cities: Skylines unless it is at a good sale price.I love simulation games, but this one grew stale and was not for me.The first several hours were really enjoyable and I even went as far as to get the After Dark DLC at a sale price since I anticipated I'd be addicted. But only a few hours later did I realize I wasn't enjoying the game anymore. There are no ""scenarios"" to play, adding actual goals to the game, unless you get the Natural Disasters DLC (and there are apparently very few). You're just left to endlessly build a city with intricate micromanagement. If that sounds like your type of game, buy it! If that's all you want, this game will be perfect.My major complaints that led to me stop enjoying the game began with the lack of customization. For the first while, before your city's population adds up and you unlock more features, there's not much to add personalization to your city to make it feel like your own. Different types of roads and other customizations are blocked off arbitrarily in the early portion of building a city, and you'll only get access to these by boosting your population by a stated amount. It makes sense! It really does, but it made the first hour or two of starting a new city absolutely boring. I feel the game would have benefitted from loosening these restrictions.... and to follow that up, you may say ""there are mods, though!"" Yes, there are, and I was very excited to try them. However, the community proves that there are troubles with every update. Mods become incompatible, unsupported by the developers, and as a new player, lots of research will go into finding out how to use these mods and have them appear in your game, like custom buildings or styles. Many times, just trying to make sure custom content appeared in the in-game ""Content Manager"" would crash the game just after a few items. I thought it was just because I originally ran the game on an external hard drive, but I eventually tried it on my internal SSD, and the mods just seemed to hamper the game.If you have a lot of patience to learn the sciene behind the custom content of the game, and don't mind the aimless city-building with not much else to look forward to but ""more, more and more"". This is a sandbox game for you, no question.I understand why some people like it, but after the amount of time I played, I just feel exhausted and need a long break. The pleasure of growing my city sort of numbed itself."

They have made the game wonderfully accessible and deceptively deep if you love the micromanagement side. I won’t list what this game does right and what others fail to do as others already have, all I will say is this game is well worth your time.It amazes me how a small team of six (I believe fourteen now) can make this wonderful gem of a game that will no doubt become the next pillar for city builders meanwhile at EA and Maxis they mess up so badly.

470,70.4,Not Recommended, February 7,9,"When I bought this game I thought I would be getting a ""complete"" experience. Sure, for that price, maybe not a really big game, nor a polished one, you get what you pay for after all.What I surely didn't thought I would get was a plateform for DLCs which now costs more than 100 euros if you want the ""complete"" experience, until they add even more DLCs that is.First gripe, DLCs should be for additional content, NOT basic game features that should be there from the start, like, you know, day/night cycles or TRAFFIC, in a city builder.Second gripe, now the game costs more than a AAA game, and people keep defending that. I guess small publishers are no better than the big ones, and I wonder if things would have been different if Colossal Order was an indie studio. At this point it just seems like they're milking their fanbase.I'd prefer to pay 60 bucks for a finished product instead of having to wait for a pile of DLCs to get basic features. I spent 70 hours trying to build a city with a functional traffic system, even installing mods to fix the problem, starting over several times, then gave up and saw the devs selling Mass Transit as DLC.

145,176.6,Not Recommended," November 22, 2015",595,"Well this game is a strange one. To sum it up: If you only want to design a nice looking city you'll probably like this game. But if you want to build a city and to deal with challenging problems in this city you'll probably be bored very soon, because the game mechanics are too simple and not challenging at all. In my point of view this is mainly caused by the following issues:Traffic: Probably the only challenging problem within your city. It's ok or even a little bit too low within downtown but much too high in industrial districts. Furthermore traffic jams are often caused by the stupid AI. You'll spend much time optimizing it by building additional roads, railroads, bus lines and so on. But then again - there are almost no penalities for having a bad traffic system. Only if the traffic becomes too bad growables won't get enough resources, which again causes your citizens to abandon them.I could still continue with this list for a while. But at least in my view the above mentioned flaws within the game mechanics are the most important ones. So I'll stop here. There are also some minor issues with the graphics (scales of growables are wrong) and with the GUI (placing roads and bus lines often becomes tedious). But I could easily forgive those issues if the basic game mechanics were better."

43,56.0,Recommended," March 18, 2015",4,"This game is very nicely put together, and I hope to continue to see the game grow and advance over time.The game RUNS PERFECTLY FINE on LINUX!However, to do so, there are a few things you must ensure before trying to play the game.1. Have UPDATED video drivers. Nvidia 345+ is required. Lastest version of flgrx and intel video drivers are also REQUIRED.2. Ensure your audio system is updated (pulse, oss, etc).3. Ensure the following are fully updates: kernel, util-linux, sed, and coreutils.I am on Fedora 21 and the ONLY problem I ran into playing the game, was the loading screen would 'freeze' and sit there while game sounds played in the background upon loading a world. Clicking off-program fixed the screen, until you re-focused into the game and then it would show the frozen screen again.To fix this, DISABLE the steam in-game overlay, and run the game in borderless-window mode (on steam, use launch option -popupwindow, and set in-game display setting to windowed mode, relaunch client, problem fixed)Occasionally my sound driver would break and play very staticish sounds for the game, after a short time they would fix themselves. Updating coreutils and pulseaudio fixed this for me.Overall I was skeptical to try the game due to the overwhelming amount of negative reviews from Linux users due to performance and playability, I caved in and tried it anyway and was not dissapointed in the slightest. I am quite impressed with the game overall, and have not had any other major performance issues, I now have a 40k population city and still do not lag or have FPS drop, tho occasionally, you should save game and re-start client as it will get a tad laggy, but I experianced the same issue on Windows 7 aswell.System Specs:OS: Fedora 21 x64CPU: AMD FX 4300 x4 3.8gHzMB: ASRock 880GM-LE FXGPU: EVGA NVidia 650GTXRAM: 16GB non-ecc Corsair 1666HD: Hitatchi 6TB hard diskKernel version: 3.18.8-201NVidia Driver Version: 346.47"

308,3.8,Not Recommended, January 21,7,"Don't let my in-game hours or review fool you. I love this game and I want to recommend it to those looking for an extremely in-depth experience with a city builder like Cities: Skylines; however, one thing prevents me from giving it a full recommendation in my book:Paradox Interactive's business practicesLike most other games developed or published (CS is published by Paradox), you aren't going to get much out of the core ""vanilla"" experience. Features that should be commonplace within a game like Cities: Skylines or to help alleviate commonsensical things like traffic are locked behind a paywall. This is apparent for Paradox's other games like Crusader Kings II where if you want to have an enjoyable experience, you are either going to need to mod your game extensively (which may or may not be always easy or coherently understandable) or pay quite a bit for what would be considered ideal and/or a complete experience with features that should not have been cut from the base game. I'm all for supporting this game and the developer; however, I have an issue when an experience is intentionally muddied by inherent greed or milking players out of their hard-earned monies.Again, don't take this review has me hating the game. I love Cities: Skylines. It's a nostalgia trip for me as I grew up playing a lot of city builders and poured way more hours into them than I should have. The game has tons of replayability, has an extensive modding community, and is extremely visually appealing; however, what holds this review back for me is the less-than-ideal business practice that seeped its way into the game. A few DLCs here and there are fine if you are wanting to add more content for the player; we overstep that boundary when some of the DLCs are essentially mandatory to have an enjoyable and not as frustrating experience as they have content or features that should have been placed into the base game. My recommendation for anyone looking to get into Cities: Skylines is that you should wait until the game and some of its content goes on sale. It may not be as expensive as some games on Steam; however, you are still going to be paying in quite a bit for the full experience at full price."

As the population of your city grows, the game unlocks buildings, monuments, new sources of power and city service buildings to help you craft your city. The best aspect of Skylines, took no more than a few days to take off- the modding community *slow clap*- you guys will continue to drive longevity and replay value by adding new content, imported buildings from past Sim City games, and mods to enhance our experience. Great work so far. Not to take anything away from Colossal Order. These guys fixed a lot of the bugs found in the first weekend in just 4 days.

30,139.9,Recommended," January 3, 2016",10,"My simplified game review after my first major capitol city. I want to keep it simple because of the lack of hours however, here I go for the new players =DPros: 101. Very nice balance you have to integrate in your cities' design between the residential (low/high density) vs commercial (low/high density) vs industrial.2. Day and Night cycle affects the functions of cities which is new for me. Ex The sound pollution at night in a leisure district affects low density residents. There are many more examples.3. This game doesn't spell anything out for you besides using the basic functions of zoning, road connecting, traffic etc. You have to experiment for yourself to see how policies, roads, crime, or new building work together. If you are a cookie cutter gamer, you might not like this pro.4. The economy is how you control your city. Its the lifeline. IF you have no money all you can do is raze structures, rezone, tax higher, redistrict. No more city buildings to aid your zones.5. Land values increase your taxes, if you design your city well to meet individual needs, equity goes up.6. Graphics are fantastic. It makes it easy to get lost in your creation.7. Rename businesses, districts, citizens, buildings.8. Workshop content keeps the game fresh once you break that last few achievements.9. You can create your own maps to build your own cities in if you dont care for default variants.10. Set paths for buses and metros to combat the terrors of the common enemy in cities: rush hour.1. The Zoned buildings will be repetitive.2. Puting in water pipes can feel like busy work.3. No natural disaster to spice up the game once you are satisified with your creation(possibly a future mod or expansion I hope).4. Traffic lights = Inefficient. No other way of putting it. Combination of timing with lights and the AI pathing the vehicles.Conclusion: If you are into building cities, Get this game. Its relaxing, interesting, and stunning. Be creative and be the next Robert Moses (New York), Hippodamus of Miletus (Ancient Greece), or Georges-Eugène Haussmann (Paris) of the modern world."

A mode that would allow you to lay out the city in advance without any costs incurred. This would have helped with basic zoning and planning. Instead, I end up spending nearly all of my starting budget on ROADS...just to chart the damn city.It's a bit annoying at times. Especially that fake twitter thing.

I could see my ""sims"" walking around the town, so do the vehicles.- Nice feature (district, making power line, need pipe for sewer and water)- Easy for moding- Can create our own map!- The trafic flows perfectly- The budget is usefull in this gameCons :- There are some annoying bug (my pipe drain couldn't work although there is power. Need to replace it until it works)- The game pace is too fast. I could get new land at although my city is still small.- The price for buying new land is too cheap. How can new land is cheaper than my drain pipe.- Some traffic's flow is annoying. The decision for choosing side of road by driver is just for the direction for next intersection.- Stll lack of variety of model. Especially, when building is high level.So far it is great city builder game in market. You could design your own city freely. Tools of making road is userfriendly and the UI is so minimalize so you could get all information fast.

49,152.0,Not Recommended," March 1, 2016",34,"I will start off with saying that I can't recommend this game. Which is a shame.It just isn't a finished product in my opinion. You will get something that resembles a release ready product if you choose to use the Workshop and download assets and mods. This will however prove to be an unwise decision as when a new DLC+patch comes, you can most likely say goodbye to your city. You will at least have a very hard time getting it to run like it did the day before said content was released.Many are praising the game for its water dynamics, I won't. Actually I think the water is really bad. Build a dam? The water will have none of that and start flowing upstreams just to get away from it. I would had been excited over the water if you could add streams when creating maps in the editor. Like drawing a stream with a special tool to tell the water which direction to go and intensity.Let's talk about powerplants.There are seven of them to choose from, two of which are windpower and two which you most likely will never use. Those two would be the dam and the solar power plant. The dam is useless because of how water functions in the game, no it is not me that is incompetent. I have done a lot of testing in the editor to try and get it right for a dam, and honestly it is such a pain to get it to work that you are better off just plopping down windpower or any of the rest. Even the solarplant would be better. Nice clean energy to power your city, right? No. Nighttime was added to the game, and for some reason in the universe this game plays out in, they have not invented any method to store generated extra power. So when the darkness falls, there will be no tv watching or showering for your cims, as the plant produces 0 energy for the duration of the night.Did you read somewhere that they where introducing weather in the newest DLC+patch? Did you also hear them saying that the weather was cosmetic? Well...it isn't. Apparently the ""cosmetic"" fog will block out the sun and lower the effeciency of your solar plant. ""Cosmetic"" rain will make the temperatures drop so your cims use more power to heat their homes. Doesn't really sound that cosmetic, does it?All that is fine, this is what happens in real life with weather, but the cluelessness of the publisher stating obvious wrong facts in interviews is not. So with the nighttime and fog, you might just want to skip that solar power plant.The AI in the game is horrible. I am sure you have heard about it on forums and such. The cars will force themselves into one or two lanes instead of using the full potential of the roads. Emergency vehicles will patiently keep behind the other drivers and so on.Another thing that is quite annoying is the complete lack of developer presence on the game's forums here on Steam. In my opinion, if you choose to release a game on Steam you should also be bothered with the big community it will gather there. I think that the sole reason for Cities: Skylines ""success"" is that people where desperate after something else after being let down by Simcity: 2013.If you decide to buy this game you will get some fun out of it at the beginning, but you will with no doubt get more and more annoyed later on when finding more and more stuff in the game that simply does not work, or works in a very odd way.Defender of the devs need not comment about this and that, if this is the best game in the world for you and everything works like a charm then go and make a positive review and enjoy your game."
356,50.4,Recommended," March 24, 2015",4,"The city builder everyone has been waiting for since SC4 is here. Thank goodness.The original SimCity wasn't called a game by Will Wright, it's designer. It was called a software toy. That's because there was no winning or losing beyond some pretty basic functions (like not losing money) but was a matter of how you wanted to create your city. How do you want your citizens to get to work? Do you want to create a city where most everyone walks through parks and forests? Do you want to create an ultra-dense metropolis? A suburban community?Now Maxis built on that formula and ultimately created the very complex and enjoyable SC4. It wasn't really a software toy any more though. It was a simulation.Skylines takes it back a bit towards the original SimCity. Whatever your dream is, you can pretty much create it in Skylines. This is the type of game where you can spend 30 minutes just building one intersection or do it in 5 second. You can spend hours crafting that new walking path or add 50,000 people to your city in that amount of time. They've added a host of options - road types, pathways, zones, policies which allow you to create most anything you can imagine. It's a ton of fun and harkens back to that Software Toy designation.Now it's not perfect. At times the game isn't challenging enough. You'll find yourself making tons of money and no real problems in your city (besides traffic). Traffic remains a stubborn problem sometimes no matter what you do. Since traffic impedes city services like fire, garbage and so forth it's not always an easy fix. But beyond that there's little challenge. In SC4 it was very easy to mess up the balance of a neighborhood and watch it crumble into decay. Skylines is much more forgiving and the lack of challenge is probably the biggest flaw.At the same time, you play a game like this simply create and have fun. You can create a small town or a massive metropolis. And unlike the Cities XL series, this one has personality. It's cool just following a vehicle around your city. The day/night cycle is interesting. I find the art style cute and the music charming. But what I like most of all is that you can really tailor the game to your goals and then drive forward towards those goals. And when you want to do something different, the game gives you the tools to pursue those new goals. I'm not just plopping down another generic neighborhood. I'm crafting a new development complete with walking trails around a pond. Or I'm crafting the majestic entrance off the freeway to my stunning metropolis. Or I'm crafing a self-sustainable logging community in the foothills, isolated away from the rest of the world. The choice is yours.The Steam Workshop integration helps too. You have many mods, buldings and other options to choose from and that kind of community involvement gave long legs to SC4. Thus Skylines is perfect for all ages and something that most gamers will greatly enjoy."

89,319.6,Not Recommended," November 24, 2016",17,"It lacks the depth and realism of the old SimCity series. This game is very easy, build any common-sense city and you will be rolling in tax income with no budgetary, social, or infrastructure problems whatsoever. The buildings and vehicles are cartoony and look like candy. Certain mechanics are poorly thought-out, such as the optional day-night cycle disabling solar power plants and the ridiculous six-lane roads causing more problems than they solve. The DLC packs add one or two useful features, usually transportation-related, but are padded with otherwise useless content. Public saunas, really? This is not stuff real city governments are concerned with.Still, it's an impressive engine with some surprisingly intricate modeling, such as the waterworks and traffic simulation. But if you were expecting the next-generation SimCity 4 with countless hours of challenges, urban intrigue, and entertainment, prepare to be disappointed. It's a mildly interesting antfarm that happens to be the only city-building game on the market right now."

It came out soon after sim city failure so i guess you know why it got so popular. I've played it for a while and i'm disappointed. There's no target of this game. You can get highest tier of city in no time, money is very easy to get and it becomes boring after a while. But the game itself is good. It's very friendly for mods(which are cool) you can make a nice city but i'm really missing a target in this game. someone could say that you don't need a target in game like that... well... true but if you played a very old game called City Life(there's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ remake of it on steam) you know that trying to get everyone happy, employed and get every group of people is very fun. That game was making you strugle to get that 1% of snobs and so on. in Tropico 4 you also have targets and it makes it a fun game(would be pretty boring without it). so you get me by now. its just a pointless city builder. it's not even economical game(like a lot of city builders). So building cities. it's pretty good. you have to provide water, electronics(not by making a building but with pipes and wires), you have to take rid of trash, road traffics, you've got airports, buses, metro(or tubes ya british ♥♥♥♥♥♥s), pretty much everything.So in overall - pointless but very good city builder 6.5/10(just for being pointless)"

I even remember the teacher showing kids how to play the game. What better way to teach kids the value of well funded schools?This game exists mostly because under the ownership of EA the Simcity series has really faltered. Major technical issues and limitations and lost opportunities and hurt the series.This game is easy, much easier than any Simcity game I’ve played. Some of it is easier because things just work better, like the water pipe systems. The economics are just a lot easier. I actually think this is more realistic. I live in California, and here government funding isn’t really an issue, the issue is that throwing money at problems doesn't really help a lot. Traffic isn’t an issue of money, it's an issue of what to do. Same goes for crime, education, and especially water, or even pollution. City skylines emulates this, money isn’t a big problem, but planning and management is the heart of the challenge.ProsGreat aesthetics. Night time is absolutely beautiful. The city looks great.So many options as far as roads, zoning, utilities, really fun variety.I like the easy economics which let you just focus on city building.Steam workshop and lots of mods.The size of the maps is amazing. As your city grows you will unlock more and more land, faster than you could fill it. It really puts Simcity franchise to shame."

9,13.1,Not Recommended," November 27, 2017",47,"I can see why people might love this. There is an almost manic level of detail going on in terms of the simulation. The thing is, this isn't like the old sims. You're basically a network manager and nothing more. You create the infrastructure then let the game go. For the most part it is sitting watching the little guys fiddle about with their lives whilst you snore peacefully until a milestone is unlocked so that you can add new structures or until you have the budget to buy up more squares.I really found this very dull and very easy. Once you get to grips with the controls for roads/intersections and bridges and once you realise a little forward planning is required then it really is pause, set up, play, pause, set up, play and those sections where the game is playing are utterly dire.I much prefer the likes of Tropico with events and charachters as well as the user picking their own buildings and choosing where to put them. It's a miss for me."

It’s very easy to spend hours/days/months on a single map and fine-tune it to your liking, which is a tremendous value. The fact that it supports a map editor and Steam Workshop is all the more reason why the price tag is more than generous. Some may see “Cities: Skylines” as a “SimCity” clone, but honestly, who cares? If we put aside the fact that the former does things the latter doesn’t do, there aren’t enough stable and fun city-management games out on the market, so why complain? I, for one, am finally grateful for a current-gen city-builder that not only actually does the job correctly, but goes above and beyond my expectations.""Full Review: http://www.dadsgamingaddiction.com/cities-skylines/---"

149,192.7,Recommended," March 18, 2015",5,"Can't...Stop...Playinggggg!!!!Arrragh!I have to be honest that I pirated it before I purchased it. The reason is simple: I was skeptical whether a team consists of roughly 10 people would be able to deliver a game matches its price. You know, think about EA's SimTown...And that infamous Cities XXXXXXXL...Not trying to make excuse anyway. Just don't want to be let down.And after log into the game and start playing, it's like time slitting away from my palm. Normally in SimTown as long as you cover the city limit with buildings there will not be much point keep playing on it and in Cities XXXXXXL long before that it's going to lag to unplayable. So generally I will not be absorbed in it and will eventually lose interest and get a life.However in Cities: Skylines I have already obtained ""Metropolitan"" title and the city just looks astounding. There are much, much more buildings in my metro than you can ever build in SimTown or Cities XXL, nevertheless the game is still smooth like hell. I mean it. I'm using a Core i5 and GForce 750M laptop and the fan is blazing, but any camera pan/ rotate will be in order immediately.The mechanics is similar to simtown. Nothing can be blamed since simtown has already got a pretty good system, yet of course the bloody ""seperate township“ has to be excluded. Notable differences include the induction of ""Noise"" and power grid, etc etc. The power grid system is a bit unrealistic since as long as your suburb is extended to the point you would like electricity to flow into you don't need to pull high-voltage wire to connect it to the power plant. Clearly it can not be achieved otherwise we'll not see utility poles around in our daily life. (Sorry to be pedantic but I'm doing electrical engineering :(You can open an economy panel and tune tax rate/ policies however this bit is oversimplified IMHO. For instance there is not much noticeable effect if you change the tax rate for houses except your income.The graphic is not bad. You can complain it to be rough and undetailed, but I would rather want smoothness over a bit of detail, since with the game itself lag like s*** nobody will ever interested in zooming in to examine the minutiae of the city.Tweeting system is freshening but annoying in late game. Developer might want to expand the dictionary.This game is even equipped with a tool to form the terrain your city will be situated on. Even with a tool to enable importing of geographical data to automatically generate height offset! You know, I am currently using double screens, with google map on one screen and the game on the other, trying to create a city of Melbourne. And after terraforming, I am going to copy the city of Melbourne, street by street, building by building, onto it.What if you can't find the exact building in the game, you may ask.Create it then. This game has building creation tool. Pretty much like it in Spore.See, the replayability is vast. How amazing will it be, if you duplicate your hometown onto it, and do a bit of experiment on it maybe? Blast your home away from it? Merge this road with another to see the impact on traffic? Do whatever you like. It's your city.20/10TL;DR : BUY IT."
132,83.3,Not Recommended," October 15, 2017",5,"As it is with almost all Paradox Games at this point, I have to begin this review with saying that Cities:Skylines is a fun game to play. It is more flexible compared to other (city) building games and revived the old genre somewhat. Now to why this game recived a negativ review: DLC-Policy!!!To me it is incomprehendable why Paradox keeps going with the way they release DLCs. Either they live in their own bubble, where they keep recieving praise for there DLC or there are enough people falling for there scam..The game was released in 2015. Since then little chanced in this game. As it is typical for Paradox there were occasional ""free"" patches acompanied with a somewhat expensive DLC compared to what you acutaly recieve. Mayor free Changes where the Night-Day-Cycle, Weather and upcoming ""Green Cities"". All of these mechanics where- to put it nicely- a nice addition to your game, above all it increased the immersion. But then there are the DLCs.Paradoxs DLC-Policy was always somewhat questionable but with Cities:Skylines it almost feels like your part of a big scam!There is almost zero subtance to all of the published and to be published DLCs. Don´t get me wrong there are mechanic hidden in the DLCs but it is content that should have been in the game in the first place.All you get when buying one off the DLCs is a new building here or a new specilization for your districts there (like leisure or tourism in after dark) . Other existing mechanics get more fleshed out. The upcomig DLC ""Greener City"" will finally feature the possibility to handel the sewage! What a revolutionary feature!"

""Quick Look"" is our short impression series of various games.Cities Skyline gives the player everything you would expect from a proper modern city builder game. It has expansive maps, detailed cities and population, intricate micro management, yet it's accessible and easy to pick up.Graphically the game is a looker. With detailed models, atmospheric filtering effects, and all the little things happening when you zoom in, the game look and feels alive. The audio design is immersive with the hustle and bustle of the crowds and traffic pulling the player in. Though the music seems over dramatic and on default settings it's strangely loud, but it does the job at keeping the player company.Mechanically the game can get deep when you learn all the details, yet the basics to get going is pretty easy. With that said, the game still requires a degree of self research as all the finer details in it's mechanics aren't always fully explained.Overall Cities: Skylines is a very enjoyable city builder, and at it's core, every thing I wanted from a modern Sim City.Pros:- Easy to learn- Lots of fine detail to micromanage- Great looking, very immersive- Supports mods- Huge map to build onCons:- Finer detail mechanics aren't always explained well- Some quality of life issues could use smoothing outCities: Skyline hours played at recording: 22Completion Status on Cities Skyline: N/AThis copy of Cities: Skyline was purchased on Steam"

It is by far the best city builder I've played. much better a sim city. can strongly recommend buying this game if you want a creative city builder with many good mods that make the game much fun
218,23.5,Recommended," April 8, 2015",2,"SimCity is more expesive, mods break the game and the so called 'cities' are tiny. This is where Cities Skyline have done Steam well, as mods/maps are implemented into the game through Steam Workshop, making it safer for the game and easier to install them. The 'Cities' can be made to look like a city, instead of a square town. The graphics are impressive, they may not have the same amount of detail as SimCity but who cares, graphics are not everything, yes they are nice to have in a game, however they are not needed, for example MineSweeper's graphics are not the best but the game is fun and annoying. What I'm trying to get at, is that this game is perfect, even the graphics IMO. The only thing that does get annoying is traffic. That is part of the fun of Cities Skyline, trying to figure out how to sort the problem. I've only had this game for around a day, bought it on the 8th of April 2015, I put way too many hours into this game for it to be healthy in the past day.

So the focus is transport and you can build the city as you want because the game is almost to easy. Is easy to get money but your city will suffer from a chain of problems that you can address by adding resurces, reshaping roads and smoothing trafic. Anyway no metter how many problem the city does have is almost inpossible that your citizen become unahppy; and because criminality is linked to happyness police is not really necessaty. I suggest to give a try to the vanilla game before installing any mod/mapModsThe mod can already totally reshape the game experience: you can download tons of additional buildings both ploppable or growable, you can change the point of view to street level, alter the colur scheme and resolution, alter the interface (tranforming Chirpy in a scroll text just like the one on SC4), alter games rules to increase or decrease the challenge.Maps are also great: usign the site terrain.party you can download a map from your favourite location in the world, and since the map in the game is preaty big you can recreate a small city and its sourrounding. The water simulation express its true potential when you try to add a river in your custom map.TL:DRA great Game, maybe non perfect and not particularry challenging, but surely a great platform with a lot of potential for modding or expansion"

243,361.1,Recommended," December 23, 2017",2,"This is by far my favorite game, and the way I like to spend a decent amount of my free time. This is one of those games that can be played for many hours on end without any chance of boredom. The base game is fantastic and finished, allowing you to create any city you want. The DLC is the way DLC is supposed to be: it adds to the already complete game. Plus, with every major DLC release, the base game gets big updates as well. Importantly, the modding comunity is massive, letting you add in any building you want, change out cars, tweak settings, manage transit, improve Cim AI, and so much more. I cannot reccommend this game enough!"

The price can't be beat, and they've already pushed out free content. That doesn't even begin to touch on the amazing mod community.

270,296.1,Recommended," March 22, 2015",2,"*Edited for patch 1.1Unlike the disappointment that was SimCity 2013, Cities: Skylines is a real city simulator/builder.

You can watch them leave their home, take the subway to the bus stop to take the bus to the mall, and then do the same in reverse to go back home.As someone who fell in love with SimCity when the original came out as shareware in 1989 and have played every Will Wright game since (as well as some of the none-Will Wright followups), I highly recommend Cities: Skylines to anyone who likes city builders. This game is what we wanted from a new SimCity game, without all the bad decisions EA made.The game isn't perfect, but it's pretty damn close. It makes building truly massive cities fun and possible, and with the right hardware the cities look pretty good too with an incredible attention to detail. Building a succesful (profitable) city is fairly easy (easier than SC4 that is), but getting past the 50,000 resident mark, while dealing with traffic, water, power, garbage, and sewage is the real challenge. Getting past the 100,000 resident mark requires some creative thinking in the construction of intersections, highways, and bus lines, but it can be done and you can keep expanding your city until you run out of land to purchase.While the game is a true simulation, it has no natural disasters and if you can keep your city from dying to polluted water or choking in traffic jams, then you can continue building until the budget can't cover it anymore.Traffic has been improved greatly since launch and is now much easier to manage. We've gotten tunnels and the ability to build roundabouts and any other kind of road or rail at any level above and below ground, and the game continues to have some of the best mod support of any game ever released."

Definitely pick up a copy, you won't regret it!"

30,155.5,Recommended," March 12, 2015",2,"Addictive game. Reminds me of the promises from the first concept art we saw from Sim City (2013) that Maxis' team was unable (or unwilling) to bring to fruition. Collosal Order, you guys are rock stars! I'm beholden to your talent, and I hope we will get some future expansions to this game from you. I also can't wait to see what the modding community will surprise us with.Also, I love the art style of this game. It looks like a photorealistic miniature toy train set, especially with the tilt-shift effect. The freedom I have to place roads, bridges, and pathways is amazing, and they always join naturally and fluidly. Also, you can place objects very close together, so the result is tidy and compact, and very natural looking."

Transportation, plumbing, city zones, electricity, noise controlling, all of these are problems you will face when planning your small town, or a big city if you can play it for dozens of hours. Plz note that the RAM requirement for this game is high. Only if you have at least 8G of RAM will you have a fairly good experience of the game.

Get a job moochers, and cough up the price of a movie for new content, in of the best games on Steam. Or don't, and just enjoy the game you have!Jealousy, entitled whining, and access to a keyboard is a hell of a trifecta.

167,303.2,Recommended," March 13, 2015",2,"The city builder we've so desperatly craved for a while now. Or at least I know I'm not the only one who did. An addictive game that sucks the hours straight from your soul if you're not careful. It will take a try or two to get the hang of how to build your city, but once you do the mere size of what you can build is immense.It takes some effort to build a city to last, as it will get increasingly busy on the roads once it starts growing. You will probably spend hours on trying to make a traffic-network that isn't too clogged with all those unique people with their own schedule, car and life .. And somehow have a lot of fun doing it.A small downside to me was that, once you've build your immense city up to a certain size, you can get a bit lost on what to do next. There's only so many buildings to unlock and once the city runs, it runs itself. You could probably step away from the computer for an hour, come back and find that the only thing that has changed is how full your garbage dumps, cemetaries and wallet are (Might I add, that I find it hilarious that dead people and garbage have the same mechanic behind it?).The pathfinding for traffic still needs to be tweaked quite a bit too, but overall none of these things take away any of the fun you'll have if you enjoy city builders! Added bonus that, besides adressing the things mentioned above, the developpers have already announced so much shiny stuff they're working on for the future of the game.A hearty two thumbs way up.PS. I'm still convinced that they've added that gorgeous, gorgeous water engine just so that IGN would tell them they've got enough water."

64,520.6,Recommended," November 27, 2017",2,"Honestly my only concern is that when I've modded it too heavily my computer has a minor stroke loading in the 8000+ mods and assets. But the game holds together even with ridiculous amounts of extra content. Cities: Skylines is really and honestly a masterpiece its no BS, you get more than what you paid for, good fun with endless content made by extremely talented modders to fuel the already stellar base game. The DLC is never too expensive and delivers something new and unique adjusting how you play and offering plenty of new content. There's never any gimmicks or filler content. It's just good and that's not something you see too often these days. I highly highly recommend this game for anyone from the casual city builder to the ones who like to go in and hand build dams or airports or whole cities road sign by road sign tree by tree. Its just a really well made game."

It was definitely worth the weight (*khe khe* because GabeN) and I've loved every minute of it.

I'm sure my hours in it worth the fun, although there are some issues still.Graphics are good, but frame rates are quite low, the 'Fullscreen' mode most likely is windowed boardless, which has higher performance impact.The gameplay is a load of fun, there is almost everything you will want and if not you can create one new yourself also makes lots of interesting experiences.Sound effects are quite good, nice tracks and noisy streets.After all I would like to give a rating of 8/10"

From this point forward it's 70% traffic management, 30% city building.After 50,000 residents, it is 100% traffic management. You can't fix it without a degree in traffic control systems.It is fun to watch the subways vomit people on to the streets with each passing train, though."
132,66.7,Recommended," May 31, 2016",2,"8/10, would recommend to buy at full price.Cities: Skylines is a game that, for me, is an extension of my younger gaming expiriences. The best way to describe it, without giving the basics (its a city builder/sim), is that I believe this game is the logical continuation of the ENTIRE genre of city builders. What I mean by this is that Cities: Skylines fills the hole left behind after the release of the last major city builder.... Sim City 4.If you grew up on city building, and love the idea of a slightly more technical approach, this game will satisfy. That said, gamers new to the genre, or gamers looking for a city builder with little learning curve, Cities: Skylines can also be a good fit.All in all, a very well made city builder, which runs smooth and with good graphics and technical gameplay, and is also not too hard to learn."
67,11.7,Recommended, February 9,2,"I have had this game in my Wishlist for a while now. This week it happened to come up as a free weekend to play. I'm thinking why not, I have some time. So I download the game. It's now 11pm, and I think to myself ""What the hell, I'll fire it up and just see what it is all about, play for a couple of minutes, and see if it is something that I want to purchase."" Fast forward to 2am. 3ish hours have gone by and I am addicted, despite having the restrictions of using a controller for my first play attempt. Are my citizens dying because the water is contaminated? You bet. How's traffic you might ask? L.A. looks like a marvel of traffic engineering by comparison. If there were a statistic for road rage incidents, I am sure it would top the charts. Crime, fire, medical emergencies? My roads look like a fireworks display of emergency lights, compounded by the fact that they are all stuck in bumper to bumper traffic. Step aside Chicago, there is no way you could reach my homicide rate. One might think that I would be frustrated at this point. Not at all. I've never built a city before. But since I bought the game immediately after my 3 hour binge of how not to build a city, I will have plenty of opportunity to try to do it right. Or maybe, I want to see my virtual city burn..."

319,8.8,Recommended," June 2, 2015",2,"I've always been a fan of sim games, including all of those sim city games that ended up being massive failures. Cities: Skylines is exactly what I was looking for. It's fun, has hidden humor (ever tried following the hurse around?) and you don't need a degree in order to start playing. The price can't be beat, and they've already pushed out free content. That doesn't even begin to touch on the amazing mod community. If you're tired of paying for overpriced city building games, I would certainly reccomend Cities: Skylines, it's hard not to be addicted."
5,211.5,Not Recommended, January 4,2,"MACOS HIGH SIERRA USERS - STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAMEI have a high-end MacBook Pro, and this game used to run flawlessly on my Mac before updating to High Sierra. After updating, the game has become unplayable. It is extremely slow and laggy. I have contacted Paradox multiple times regarding this issue to no avail. They simply don't seem to care that the game does not run for a good number of their customers. I spent $40 on this game (I got the Deluxe version), cannot play it, and the developers seem to be in no rush to fix the issue - that leaves a pretty sour taste. I cannot recommend this game, not only because it no longer works, but also because of the customer service I am getting from Paradox. I tried to refrain from writing this review by contacting Paradox first, but it has been months since I have been able to run the game. I will be staying away from any Paradox titles in the forseeable future."

I only bought this late yesterday afternoon. 11.3 hours later with boggled eyes and nowhere near enough sleep for a middle aged man.........I gambled on buying this no entirely sure that my PC would even run the game (i5-2310 2.90Ghz, 8Gb RAM, GeForce 560SE) I was suprised to find I was able to run to quite a high detail level. No doubt the bigger a city gets, the more PC power I'd need, but it's trade off I'm more than happy to do. Even at lower detail the game is georgeous.The game is massive and the editor is easy to use. (Oh the water!!!!!) Click on the supplied, in game, Mod to play without running out of cash and you've got a sandbox mode. Pure joy.I recommend the first person view Mod from the Workshop aswell.Score out of ten? I don't know. Poison me with dirty drinking water, take me through traffic chaos to the city hospital and hope I don't end up at the crematorium... ask me then!!!!!!!!Top job, totally recommend, for once the hype was right"
270,296.1,Recommended," March 22, 2015",2,"*Edited for patch 1.1Unlike the disappointment that was SimCity 2013, Cities: Skylines is a real city simulator/builder. Every single resident in your city has a home, a job, an education (if you build schools that is), and everyone has somewhere they need to go. You can watch them leave their home, take the subway to the bus stop to take the bus to the mall, and then do the same in reverse to go back home.As someone who fell in love with SimCity when the original came out as shareware in 1989 and have played every Will Wright game since (as well as some of the none-Will Wright followups), I highly recommend Cities: Skylines to anyone who likes city builders. This game is what we wanted from a new SimCity game, without all the bad decisions EA made.The game isn't perfect, but it's pretty damn close. It makes building truly massive cities fun and possible, and with the right hardware the cities look pretty good too with an incredible attention to detail. Building a succesful (profitable) city is fairly easy (easier than SC4 that is), but getting past the 50,000 resident mark, while dealing with traffic, water, power, garbage, and sewage is the real challenge. Getting past the 100,000 resident mark requires some creative thinking in the construction of intersections, highways, and bus lines, but it can be done and you can keep expanding your city until you run out of land to purchase.While the game is a true simulation, it has no natural disasters and if you can keep your city from dying to polluted water or choking in traffic jams, then you can continue building until the budget can't cover it anymore.Traffic has been improved greatly since launch and is now much easier to manage. We've gotten tunnels and the ability to build roundabouts and any other kind of road or rail at any level above and below ground, and the game continues to have some of the best mod support of any game ever released."
167,303.2,Recommended," March 13, 2015",2,"The city builder we've so desperatly craved for a while now. Or at least I know I'm not the only one who did. An addictive game that sucks the hours straight from your soul if you're not careful. It will take a try or two to get the hang of how to build your city, but once you do the mere size of what you can build is immense.It takes some effort to build a city to last, as it will get increasingly busy on the roads once it starts growing. You will probably spend hours on trying to make a traffic-network that isn't too clogged with all those unique people with their own schedule, car and life .. And somehow have a lot of fun doing it.A small downside to me was that, once you've build your immense city up to a certain size, you can get a bit lost on what to do next. There's only so many buildings to unlock and once the city runs, it runs itself. You could probably step away from the computer for an hour, come back and find that the only thing that has changed is how full your garbage dumps, cemetaries and wallet are (Might I add, that I find it hilarious that dead people and garbage have the same mechanic behind it?).The pathfinding for traffic still needs to be tweaked quite a bit too, but overall none of these things take away any of the fun you'll have if you enjoy city builders! Added bonus that, besides adressing the things mentioned above, the developpers have already announced so much shiny stuff they're working on for the future of the game.A hearty two thumbs way up.PS. I'm still convinced that they've added that gorgeous, gorgeous water engine just so that IGN would tell them they've got enough water."

81,63.0,Recommended," March 11, 2015",2,"An amazing City Building game that takes personalization to another level! There's a lot of content, enough to have you playing for hours and hours. Most people viewing or playing this game have been introduced to SimCity so I'll break it down. There is more content in this game than in SimCity and it's also HALF the price that was at launch. The Map Sizes, with the current mod, can be up to 25 times the map size in SimCity, most computers cannot handle that though so it's a do at your own risk which is fine. The graphics are great and it runs flawlessly on my i7 4790k. The content for this game has unlimited potential in the future. Basically if you like City Builders and Simulators than this is the game for you, it's what SimCity and Cities XXL should have been, hands down (: Also there really isn't any bugs, at least none that I've experienced so far."

This is my first City-Builder. It's so much fun to see all the different parts of a city work to keep life functioning."
715,76.5,Recommended," March 11, 2015",2,"SimCity was one of the very first games I was ever really hooked on. I vividly remember building cities in black-and-white on my dad's office Macintosh. Since then I've jumped on pretty much any game that claims to be city-builder-ish.And not since SimCity 4, over a decade ago, have I had this much fun building a city from scratch.The scale of the space you can build in is great. Starting with 2km x 2km and eventually expanding out to 9km^2, you can build truly massive cities. What makes that scale even better is you can really divide up your metropolis in a number of ways. From districts that can have individualized govt policies (legal pot, smoke detector ditribution), to localized city services that aren't connected to the larger grid. The game gives you a ton of room to experiment.The one big challenge though you'll face is transportation. Building an effecient city grid of roads, public transit, trains & subways that doesn't have terrible choke points is difficult. Use of elevated bypasses, rail corridors etc are difficult to plan as you don't get access to them until an hour or more into a game, so you may find yourself abandoning your initial city area to build up things ""properly"" in a newly opened plot of land, then going back and bulldozing your original downtown to start it over again.Beyond the traffic challenge, it can at times be difficult to know why your city isn't growing. Sometimes demand drops to 0 for no apparant reason, then 5 minutes later skyrockets again. There's obviously something going on that's pushing down demand, but as a player it's hard to figure out some times. A few patches to improve UI and reporting will no doubt solve this issue.In the end, the traffic planning and the simulation feedback issues are pretty minor in the face of what's probably the most fun city sim since the glory days of Maxis. And at what I'd consider a ""budget"" price point, if you're a fan of the genre, this is a must-buy game."
159,24.0,Not Recommended," June 26, 2017",2,"Cities Skylines rose when SimCity fell. SimCity was a disaster at launch and was anti consumer with the always online DRM and lying to its customers that it couldn't be turned off. People turned to Cities Skylines and the game sort of became the saviour of the genre.I definitely recommended this game at first but not now. It's gone out of hand with all these DLCs. Even with the sales on, the DLCs cost £55. Significantly more than the game itself. Does this ring a bell? It's just like the EA games. Oh yeah, and without the sales, the DLCs total to around £75. And the game is £22.99.Its become a DLC simulator. You gotta pay for night, pay for a bit of snow, pay for some music update, pay for a special building, Pay for certain transports and disasters and a bunch of different looking buildings.All of those should have been included with the main game for free. Before DLCs were a thing, these were called updates. And updates were free. To top that off, those REALLY are minor upgrades to the game. If you compare to Witcher 3's expansion pass which is another 30-40 extra high quality hours of content on currently on sale for £10. Skylines DLCs really cringe.I don't recommend buying this at full price. Its currently (20-Oct-2017) on sale 75% off, so grab it now if you will. But dont buy anything from them thats not more than 75% off."
147,12.3,Recommended," March 28, 2015",2,"This is the next-generation SimCity that many of us have been waiting for. Strangely enough, it isn't SimCity, and instead is a title made by a team of fewer than 12. It's a great game in many regards. My only complaints would be that traffic is overly complicated to control, and that visual building diversity is lacking."
143,355.7,Recommended," March 10, 2015",2,"The game is very immersive. My first taste of the game sucked me in for a few hours and unlike some games it will entice me back for more as there is plenty to discover. If you're a fan of city builders then you're in for a treat here. Don't expect perfection though as there are a few bugs to iron out (i.e. burger joint signs on drug stores, Fire Engines disappearing off of the map when they should go directly to the burning building) but be assured these are extremely minor bugs that don't take anything away from the fun of the game. With Steam Workshop activated I'm sure they'll be loads to add to the game in future.The main thing i love is the fact that you can play it anyway that you want to - small scale towns/districts, large scale towns/districts - it even has a sandbox mode (unlimited money) if that's your kind of thing.I haven't even got to the public transport side of things but considering Paradox made Cities in Motion as well I'm expecting good things.One last thing to add, I will not be as petty to compare it to similar games in the genre, however it is great that you don't have to be online all the time to play it and the maps can become huge!!Well done the developers. 8.5/10"

While the ""Sim"" brand will always have a place on my gaming rig (I miss you so much Sim Tower![en.wikipedia.org]), Cities: Skylines delivers on many levels.Current ConsiderationsOkay, lets be succinct: I'm wringing every last bit of playability of the vanilla version for this game before I move on. It's just that good!Cities: Skylines has an asset editor to create your own mods in-game or you can import your own models. The modding community just blossomed within hours of the game release. Without a doubt, I will be using these creative mods in the future and quite possibly creating a few myself."

Simcity used to be the daddy back in the day but has slowly gone down hill over the years and became terrible! Games like City XL tried to pick up where Sim city left off but failed in my opinion. Then this little gem appeared. Pretty much blows away the competition. Easy to use, highly detailed down to the fact you can watch a person leave their home and go to work. The company has endorsed modding so the amount of extra content is mind blowing. From basic stuctures to being about to get into a copter and fly around your city.

169,128.7,Recommended," December 3, 2016",2,"It has some flaws (like trains not working for s*** without a lot of gimmicks) but it's still the best city builder, period.The biggest con though, for me, is that it doesn't have an ""organig"" city growth and administration mechanic. Everything is more about ""city designing"" if you wish. You end up with cities that are always perfectly planned (the imperfections are only the ones you yourself put in). After you know how the mechanics work there will be little or even nothing to ""suprise"" you during game play. The game ends up being more about aestethics than it is about city management.I'd like so much for the cities to have a more realistic growth feeling.On the other hand, the pros are just way too long to list. It's good, it's beautiful, it's fun to design a city even if managing it is a bit lackluster. And the devs are pretty cool. The workshop and the modding community are phenomenal. Defo a worth buy.The DLCs, though... Not so much. They're ok, but mostly insanely overpriced for what you get."

The best way to describe it, without giving the basics (its a city builder/sim), is that I believe this game is the logical continuation of the ENTIRE genre of city builders. What I mean by this is that Cities: Skylines fills the hole left behind after the release of the last major city builder.... Sim City 4.If you grew up on city building, and love the idea of a slightly more technical approach, this game will satisfy. That said, gamers new to the genre, or gamers looking for a city builder with little learning curve, Cities: Skylines can also be a good fit.All in all, a very well made city builder, which runs smooth and with good graphics and technical gameplay, and is also not too hard to learn."

Making your population happy and making money for expansion is a surprisingly satisfying activity.Zoning, districts and council policies are all concepts which are introduced gradually without fuss or complication. The 3D game engine is spectacular, intuitive and gorgeous to look at.I had a two thousand citizen city after just a few hours and spent another couple with the game on 'pause' just admiring my creation.I'm months away from modding the game but already I can see huge replayability and value for money.Congratulations to development team - Cities Skylines is clearly a labour of love.I would recommend this game to everyone, especially town planners.

Although it looks beautiful and extremely realistic, it comes at the cost of lag and lots of crashes (especially if you have a mod and asset addiction like me) unless if you have an extremely good graphics card (I have a Nvidia 750 GTX TI and average 50-80 without mods and max graphics and 24 GB of RAM and with 1257 mods and assets it consumes 21 GB, but has a common chance of not being able to load at all and just crash).

Micro-managers will love the ability to fine tune almost every aspect of their cities, from the names of city districts all the way down to following a single citizen around throughout his day. While there is a bit of a learning curve and the in-game tutorial is rather lacking (a hallmark of Paradox games) there are many youtubers and an official wiki that can help get you up to speed. A great, affordable buy for pretty much anyone!"
61,12.1,Recommended," February 21, 2017",2,Basically Sim City but more modern. I think this game is aimed towards those who like to build cool cities. The actual game play where you start off with no money and progress upwards is pretty easy and not very challenging. However I love to use the unlimited funds option built in and just build what I want. It seems to be a little buggy at time but most of the time it's pretty smooth.
222,5.6,Recommended," July 7, 2015",2,"the only reason why I didnt played much is because of my crappy 1.8GHz i7 4500U CPU built inside my laptop (which can overclocked to 3.0GHz but not sure if it's a wise choice to overclock it or not).other than that, I r8 it 9/10 (-1 for being unable to play it in my laptop yet) :P***edit: I can play it at my laptop yey \o/"
217,103.8,Recommended," March 16, 2015",2,"After playing 9 hours I can definately say this is a great game and puts EA's latest SIMCITY to shame. You can build cities 9 times the size of the ones in SIMCITY. The district mechanic is excellent allowing you to easily name and manage different areas of your city. The transport systems are good, you create bus/train routes and set heavy traffic bans in certain districts. The game looks good and runs smooth as balls and with the support of Steam Workshop I can see this game lasting a long time. If you want a good city builder this is worth full price."

That's essentially what this game is.I definitely found it quite hard to get my head around at first but I've really enjoyed it.

221,18.2,Recommended," March 13, 2015",2,"It's a city builder, you build a city from the ground up using limited options provided to you then as you gain more citizens you then are given more options. There isn't much else to say besides that.oh and Yes, this is much better than that simcity game."

242,60.5,Recommended," March 14, 2015",2,"This is what SimCity should have been. Instead of shoehorning in city specializations to make up for the tiny cities, this lets you build GIGANTIC, sprawling cities (especially with mods), where traffic and transit flow is hugely important. Even with the unlimited money cheat, this game is surprisingly difficult to master, but it always feels like your actions have an effect. The only downside so far is that you can't really see what parts of the city rich people live in vs. which parts are poor people. Still, anyone who likes city sims is going to love this one."
165,82.1,Recommended," June 3, 2016",2,"I had never even been interested in city-building games before I bought this game on a whim. It is awesome fun, for players new to the genre as well as veterans. If you have even a passing interest in city building I would highly recommend this game. :)"
30,155.5,Recommended," March 12, 2015",2,"Addictive game. Reminds me of the promises from the first concept art we saw from Sim City (2013) that Maxis' team was unable (or unwilling) to bring to fruition. Collosal Order, you guys are rock stars! I'm beholden to your talent, and I hope we will get some future expansions to this game from you. I also can't wait to see what the modding community will surprise us with.Also, I love the art style of this game. It looks like a photorealistic miniature toy train set, especially with the tilt-shift effect. The freedom I have to place roads, bridges, and pathways is amazing, and they always join naturally and fluidly. Also, you can place objects very close together, so the result is tidy and compact, and very natural looking."
146,73.7,Recommended," March 23, 2015",2,Excellent Game. Paradox have come a long way and learned alot from thier Cities game series. This is the culmination of learning what does/does not work. Its the most fun I've had in a game like this in years. Definatly recomend it!
43,12.4,Recommended," November 26, 2016",2,"This game is a really fun city builder that I can't recommend highly enough. If you want more casual, relaxing gameplay then look no further. The satisfaction of building your own city from the ground up provides a great experience and if you enjoy the game enough then lots of DLC are available which give an overall more immersive feel to the game. Definitely pick up a copy, you won't regret it!"

243,361.1,Recommended," December 23, 2017",2,"This is by far my favorite game, and the way I like to spend a decent amount of my free time. This is one of those games that can be played for many hours on end without any chance of boredom. The base game is fantastic and finished, allowing you to create any city you want. The DLC is the way DLC is supposed to be: it adds to the already complete game. Plus, with every major DLC release, the base game gets big updates as well. Importantly, the modding comunity is massive, letting you add in any building you want, change out cars, tweak settings, manage transit, improve Cim AI, and so much more. I cannot reccommend this game enough!"

46,10.8,Recommended," March 21, 2015",2,"What an amazing game! Cities Skylines is epic, it has loads and loads and loads of different things in. From Police departments to oil power plants: it is amazing. There is a massive range of things you can do! You can mod it directly from the Steam workshop.Overall Summary:Cities: Skylines is extremely detailed. You have to set up electricity and water plants to make sure everyone gets what they need, and that is not even the start. I am not a fan of city builders, but I am a fan of this one. I think they could add a slight extension to the mods, as you can only have 3.Overall score: 95%"
143,355.7,Recommended," March 10, 2015",2,"The game is very immersive. My first taste of the game sucked me in for a few hours and unlike some games it will entice me back for more as there is plenty to discover. If you're a fan of city builders then you're in for a treat here. Don't expect perfection though as there are a few bugs to iron out (i.e. burger joint signs on drug stores, Fire Engines disappearing off of the map when they should go directly to the burning building) but be assured these are extremely minor bugs that don't take anything away from the fun of the game. With Steam Workshop activated I'm sure they'll be loads to add to the game in future.The main thing i love is the fact that you can play it anyway that you want to - small scale towns/districts, large scale towns/districts - it even has a sandbox mode (unlimited money) if that's your kind of thing.I haven't even got to the public transport side of things but considering Paradox made Cities in Motion as well I'm expecting good things.One last thing to add, I will not be as petty to compare it to similar games in the genre, however it is great that you don't have to be online all the time to play it and the maps can become huge!!Well done the developers. 8.5/10"
137,621.1,Recommended," July 15, 2015",2,"Though my computer isn't the best for this game, it is good enough that I can form an opinion for it. This game is definitely a step up from the SimCity series. I found that the game was more complex that SimCity 2013 and the traffic A.I. is better. I love how the game manages to densely pack the buildings close together, something SimCity 2013 wasn't able to do. I also like the bigger city size, though with all 25 tiles, it might as well be a reigion. The water physics is also a nice touch, as was the map editor.Something I don't like about the game would be the lack of disasters. In SimCity 2013, the disasters added a challenge to the game. In Cities Skylines, the most difficult challenge would be solving any traffic problems your city has. Really, the worst that can happen is a death wave due to disease or the flooding of a low lying areas. Another thing I don't like is the fact that we can't change what the suspension bridge looks like. Also, the game doesn't really have a good amount of different buildings, meaning that there is often the same building side-by-side. Also, I found that the game suffers from some game glitches due to mods (i.e. Road tools disappearing in the map editor).Overall, I would definitely recommend this game!"

It was full price but I heard there might be only online problems so I waited until after it was out and tada, there was problems. So I waited.I waited a while. Still had problems.I waited more, they came out with expensive DLC and finally fixed the always online but heard it still had issues with roads and the cities were so small. So I waited for them to fix that. They never did.Price went down. Still had issues, so I waited.They created a game of the year with all the DLC included, fixed a lot of issues and put it on sale for $20. Was thinking on buying it but then they fired everyone that made the game so I knew they would never fix anything else. So I waited.2 days later Cities: Skyline came out. It was worth the wait."

159,24.0,Not Recommended," June 26, 2017",2,"Cities Skylines rose when SimCity fell. SimCity was a disaster at launch and was anti consumer with the always online DRM and lying to its customers that it couldn't be turned off. People turned to Cities Skylines and the game sort of became the saviour of the genre.I definitely recommended this game at first but not now. It's gone out of hand with all these DLCs. Even with the sales on, the DLCs cost £55. Significantly more than the game itself. Does this ring a bell? It's just like the EA games. Oh yeah, and without the sales, the DLCs total to around £75. And the game is £22.99.Its become a DLC simulator. You gotta pay for night, pay for a bit of snow, pay for some music update, pay for a special building, Pay for certain transports and disasters and a bunch of different looking buildings.All of those should have been included with the main game for free. Before DLCs were a thing, these were called updates. And updates were free. To top that off, those REALLY are minor upgrades to the game. If you compare to Witcher 3's expansion pass which is another 30-40 extra high quality hours of content on currently on sale for £10. Skylines DLCs really cringe.I don't recommend buying this at full price. Its currently (20-Oct-2017) on sale 75% off, so grab it now if you will. But dont buy anything from them thats not more than 75% off."

356,26.6,Recommended," March 12, 2015",2,"I have to admit, I never really got into the whole city simulation genre. I always wanted to tryr out SimCity, but with all the bad reviews of the newest one, I strayed away and never looked back. After seeing some videos of Cities: Skylines I figured I'd try it. I'll say thing. Cities: Skylines is one of the best games I've played in quite a long time.As a newcomer to the genre, I found it easy enough to get a grasp on the basics fairly quickly. Don't mistake that for being easy though. After going for about 10 hours my city went into a chain reaction because my trash collection wasn't up to par. My citizens got sick, died, and then their homes were left abandoned, leading to lower property values for the rest of the homes. Within 30 minutes I went from a thriving and growing city of 60,000 citizens to a bankrupt city of 5000. It was a real reminder that the city you build is delicate, and can be destroyed past the point of no return with a single mistake.Overall, the game makes it easy to understand yet remains a challenge at the same time. The UI is easy to use and has never given me issues. The game also runs VERY smoothly, even when your city reaches large populations.Cities: Skylines is certainly worth a look whether you're a veteran SimCity player or new to the genre."

From this point forward it's 70% traffic management, 30% city building.After 50,000 residents, it is 100% traffic management.

Already tons of mods on the Workshop.-Flow of traffic and people is very smooth and feels very responsive.Cons:-No tutorials, figure it out or find a guide.-City seems to stop growing for a while after you hit a ceartain pop.

Most people viewing or playing this game have been introduced to SimCity so I'll break it down. There is more content in this game than in SimCity and it's also HALF the price that was at launch. The Map Sizes, with the current mod, can be up to 25 times the map size in SimCity, most computers cannot handle that though so it's a do at your own risk which is fine. The graphics are great and it runs flawlessly on my i7 4790k. The content for this game has unlimited potential in the future. Basically if you like City Builders and Simulators than this is the game for you, it's what SimCity and Cities XXL should have been, hands down (: Also there really isn't any bugs, at least none that I've experienced so far."

I find it really confusing and quite finicky to create a bus line.- Another small gripe, but the two different blues used for Offices and Light Commercial are too similar, I often click the wrong one.- Not very...exciting? It's fun to play, its light hearted, its nice to kill a bit of time but after an hour or two I found myself logging out. Some sort of immersion is missing. There isn't that much do apart from expand your city, there's no trade (not that I have yet seen) for example. Maybe having some ""ghost AI"" cities far on the horizon that you can't visit but see could be connecting to your city and then opening possibilities of trade would be really awesome and give more emphasis on feeling that you're part of a connected world.

44,27.0,Recommended," March 15, 2015",2,"A real return to city building greatness.I approached Cites:Skylines with a small amount of trepidation, I have already been burnt by the disappointment that was the most recent Sim City.However Cities:Skylines is no Sim City clone. Rather it takes a lot of the best elements of the Sim City franchise, and puts them into a very a slick, playable and user friendly package. The game is friendly to a new user, introducing new elements and features over time in a gated sense, but don't be mistaken it isn't impossible to fail, on my very first city I managed to bankrupt myself before I had proper infrastructure or even a few buildings because of my complex and excessively ambitious waste management and water system. From the get go there is a lot to do providing an engaging experience, but not so much as to overwhelm. There is enough detail and content to introduce the newer player gradually whilst simultaneously allowing players with more experience new ways to improve and experiment.You start off small, with a few roads and your very most basic amenities and infrastructure for water and electricity. You attract a few hundred people, build a school, and start expanding your commercial center. Before you know it you are the mayor of a town of 50,000, rebuilding motorways, managing 6 lane roundabouts and trying to build a spaghetti roller-coaster of a highway junction to alleviate excessive congestion as traffic pours into your Metropolis to visit your colossal skyscrapers. It is a very satisfying experience, through your own strategy and planning you have turned a small dull field with a few small houses into a buzzing, noisy city with a real character of your own choosing.Despite how enjoyable the game has been so far in the short term, my most considerable worry going into the future is the potential lack of replay value. You build your infrastructure , you grow your city, you put amenities and services. The play pattern every game is pretty much identical, and there are very few randomly generated elements to change this. Combined with the lack of multiplayer capability really begs the question what will keep players coming back for more. However this is certainly somewhat alleviated by the games innate modability and interaction with the steam workshop, which seems to add a lot of capability and even quality of life fixes to the game.This game has such a low price-tag that you could easily get your value for money in a few play throughs, and even if you do get burnt out there is not much to lose. The game also has all of the appropriate attributes to evolve and grow with the release of DLC and steam workshop content, making it a really appealing prospect to come back to when you feel like a spending your time building a city.The game is fairly slow tempo by design, this shouldn't be a surprise it's being a city builder not Call of Duty. If slower simulation games (Civilization, city management games, Rome Total War etc) are not to you preference then I can't really suggest this will do much to change that. It's a great game for relaxing, and thinking, but its not high tempo competitive nor challenging game. Though that does not mean it isn't engaging, there is always something to do and things ever changing as you grow your city, it always keeps the player considering of ways to improve/diversify or grow the city.The lack of multiplayer is a missed opportunity. Had the game had similar multiplayer functionality to the most recent Sim City, such as if there was some way of building concurrent cities that would evolve and change depending on a friend''s decisions in real time would have made for an even more complete experience. At the very least better functionality in terms of sharing cities and visiting cities created by friends would add a lot discussion and interaction, but I imagine these features are possibilities for the future, the game itself is a great platform which could be easily extended to a mutliplayer experience which I feel would round off the experience and add significant longevity.4/5.A very good city building simulation that is very accessible, with a user friendly and functional UI and variable gameplay pacing. The game is simultaneously relaxing yet intriguing, and ultimately leaves the player feel very satisfied.The steam workshop, and other modability means the game may continue to grow, but the static gameplay pattern with very little variability or random events and no current multiplayer make the longevity questionable."
207,695.6,Recommended," March 10, 2015",2,"Best City builder in YEARS! You won't be disapointed if you love city builders. I'm only 3 hours in and the quality over Simcity 13 is apparent from the start. I've seen some people complain about the graphics but they are good. It's the quality of gameplay in these types of games that keep the true city builder fans engaged, The only bad reviews so far are from people that don't know what their PC will handle, hardly the devs fault.

251,47.6,Recommended," March 10, 2015",2,It's early March and I'm prepared to call this Game of the Year right now. It's the SimCity you've always wanted. It's perfection. It's beautiful. It's dense. It's entertaining. It's affordable. I don't think this game will ever be uninstalled from my computer.
1,10.6,Recommended," March 10, 2015",2,So I've played this for 5 1/2 hours straight and can confirm its one of the best City builders out there. It is exactly what Simcity 2013 should have been if EA didnt ♥♥♥♥ up so much. Even though its only launch day I would already rate this as one of the best city builders out there.
288,41.8,Recommended," March 10, 2015",2,"They have actually done it. EDIT: BUT... read the end of the review.To be frank, I was skeptical if this wasn't just overhyped in the wake of the SC13 and CXL debacles, but from what I could gather in the 5 hours it has glued me to the screen tonight, Cities Skylines might be the SC4 successor we have been waiting for. The game is easy in the beginning, but not overly so and traffic and garbage can be a challenge even with 8k residents (although not an unfair one). The simulation is responsive and detailed. The interface is confusing at first but you get used to it quickly enough. They reduced SC4's diagram bloat but sadly some useful ones fell victim as well.Soundtrack is nice but rather repetitive, and the modding community will need to figure out if we can make this as pretty and diverse as SC4 was eventually.I didn't like Skylines' art style from the previews, but playing the game it grows on you. The visual fidelity in the lowest zoom levels is lacking, but you have the reassurance that what you are seeing is actually simulated, unlike SC13. You can see individual citizens, but I sort of miss the traffic flow maps from buildings in SC4RH.Variety is enough to keep me going for a couple dozen hours. I'll update this review once Skylines has passed the test of time ;)EDIT: So, I have played for 25 hours now, and thats it for now. Sorry, but the lack of gameplay depth and seeing the same building 10 times next to the others really won't keep me coming back. Yes there is the workshop, but its an unsorted mess and sifting through the thousands of reskinned buildings to find the occasional new one is exhausting. We need some content curators or new gameplay content fast."
127,56.2,Recommended," March 10, 2015",2,"To me, it reminds me to the older version of SimCity. They take bits and pieces from SimCity 3000, SimCity 4 and SimCity 2013 to make this game. Sure there are a few minor bugs, but nowhere near enough to ruin the experience. If you are an old-school SimCIty player, you will like this game."
260,150.7,Recommended," March 11, 2015",2,"This is a rare gem of a game- the kind that you keep on playing in your head even when you left the computer.City-building at it's finest. Easy to use interface, logical connections and the joy when you see your first skyscrapers building up... or when you complete especially challenging highway intersection and it works. Priceless."
129,60.5,Recommended," March 15, 2015",2,"Best city building game ever... and I don't just say that lightly. It has the depth and complexity of the best of the Sim City games mixed with sleek modern graphics.Your City live breathes and evolves constantly through the game, as you grapple to keep it from falling into enviromental and economic disaster.The only disadvantage to this game is the lack of unique disaster events, e.g earthquakes, that the Sim City franchise featured. However the developer has promised to patch them into the game.With strong features, engaging and complex game play as well as Steam Workshop mod support, Cities Skylines in everything that the recent Sim City reboot should have been."
192,38.6,Recommended," March 15, 2015",2,"Easily the best city builder to come around in a long time. It also does alot to bring new wrinkles into the established formula. Being able to name and customize pretty much anything in the game is fantastic. And also having the ability to create separate districts within the city is a great addition. You can even set different policies within each district. Want an area with no smoking? You can do that. Want people to recycle? Click the checkbox.Only thing I'd say that could be considered 'negative' would be that you can't take any loans out until you reach a population of 400+. So if you get a little overzealous when starting out (like I did), you might find yourself in a bind. You can take a Bailout, but then that disables being able to do certain things.Overall I'm really enjoying the game, and I can see this being a top played for me for awhile."

If you enjoy my videos please hit that like button and consider subscribing!Fans of city simulation games have bore an itch that has not been scratched. I’ve felt that itch as well, waiting for a quality successor to one of my favorite simulation games, and possibly one of my favorite games I had growing up. That game is SimCity 4. Since SimCity 4 came out in 2003, there has been no game that I felt was worthy of being called it’s successor. Games like Cities: XL and even Maxis’s own SimCity (which came out in 2013) have failed to produce an experience like the ever popular SimCity 4.Cities: Skylines (Which has no relation to the CitiesXL Franchise) is from the makers of the Cities in Motion franchise, a series focused primarily on managing a cities traffic. And funnily enough traffic is one of the few things I believe this game struggles with, but we’ll discuss that later.So first, lets just have a quick overview of the game.After a brief loading screen which provides you with a few random tips and tricks, you’ll be presented with your map. And a message, on the bottom right that serves as a basic and unintrusive tutorial.I generally don’t care for pop-up text tutorials, but I think colossal order did a good job, the tutorial is simple to skip and disable, as well as read and understand, and it doesn’t impact your game in a negative way.In order to build anything you will need a connection with the outside world. You do this by simply selecting the road, being presented with another easy to understand tutorial, and clicking and dragging the road to its desired length.Simple enough right? It’s been done this way in nearly every city sim I’ve ever played, it works, so it doesn’t need fixing. I think that is the same approach colossal order took while developing this game. They took everything that works in a city builder, and put it in the game. For the most part they succeeded. And where they may have failed, both in opinion and reality, users are empowered via to the Steam Workshop to create the game experience they want.This is all they had to do! This is all maxis and ea had to do to create an experience that will last a long time. Simply take what people liked from SimCity 4 and move it into the next generation of modern computing. Thats it.Now, this isn’t to say Cities: Skylines doesn’t have its faults, because it certainly does.There are some minor ones, graphically the game isn’t stunning. There are no filters and it’s just kind of grey. Although the included color correction tool in the options menu may change the visual styling more to your liking, it is very limiting only providing you with 4 options. Perhaps this can be rectified with mods, in fact it may have already been, considering there are over 30,000 mods as of this review.Another gripe I had was the lack of variety in buildings. From a distance this isn’t so noticeable, but zoom in to any one neighborhood, and you will be presented with a plethora of identical looking homes. Both in appearance and color palate.Additionally, the lack of any disaster mechanic such as what you’d find in the SimCity series is disappointing. It could have been a great way to make cities more memorable. Which brings me to another point.Often times I’d find myself playing this game for several hours in one sitting, building a city up from nothing, to a thriving megalopolis. Only to abandon the city the next day I play simply because my cities don’t feel special to me. Perhaps its just a failing of my personal style of play, or perhaps its a strike against Cities: Skylines.One of the primary issues you encounter is traffic. Traffic management quickly becomes your primary concern once your city begins to grow. It is unclear to me if this was by design or simply an undesired consequence of how the game handles “agents.”What I mean by agents is that every single moving speck, also known as your citizens, has a purpose or function, they aren’t simply randomly moving around the city with no purpose. Every delivery truck has a destination and source, just as every citizen has a job and a home. What this means, is that without careful traffic management and planning, you can experience bottlenecks, due to either your own incompetence or perhaps just how the game handles traffic, which seems to direct traffic based on the shortest distance available, and doesn’t take into account congestion.There are some other smaller gripes I have, but traffic is by far the biggest antagonist I have seen. Which brings me to another point. Beyond traffic, there is really not any end goal or ongoing metric that you have to manage. Which can turn some people off if they are looking for the game to tell them what to do, which it really doesn’t. There are some achievements or milestones, based on population which unlock new services. But these stop after 80,000 population. Meaning if you’re playing just to unlock everything, congratulations, you’ve just done it.In addition to milestones as an ongoing goal, you can also unlock unique buildings, which are earned by meeting certain requirements. For example, once your city has the airport, you can unlock the Grand Mall, which improves metrics like tourism, attractiveness and entertainment.But again, this is really all there is if you’re looking for a sense of progression. You have to create your own milestones if you really want to enjoy this game to its fullest extent. But even then, you are not experiencing all this game has to offer.The best way to play this game is with mods. There are a myriad of mods, which promise to fix nearly every problem I have encountered.A mod fixed the obnoxious color of pollution in the water and ground. A mod let me correct the direction of my roads without the need to delete and replace them. They have added in game terraforming, they allow me to place roads on top of roads.In short the possibilities of this game, as well as it’s long term viability are essentially endless. Thanks to the modding support provided by the devs, and the catalyst that is the steam workshop, making the installation of these mod files painless.This is the game that may very well dethrone what is often considered the definitive city builder, SimCity 4.Now, there's simply the matter of answering the original question I posed at the beginning of this video: Is it worth it?Despite it’s minor failings with traffic management and building variety, I think I can confidently say that this game is indeed worth the bargain price of $29.99."
7,2.4,Recommended, February 10,2,"Product received for freeBuilding roads in it is just such a nightmare I can't play it. Just trying to connect my city to the highway with proper intersections drives me insane. They hide all the road peicies from you at the start so you can't do anything proper, they unlock very quickly but it just makes it irritating to build efficiently from the start. Even the start freeway intersection they start you with is rediculous. I won't even buy it for $10 after the free trial. I would still reccomend it to others tho, because they probably dont care about the roads as much as I do."

165,47.8,Recommended," March 13, 2015",2,"The new standard in city-builders is here, brought to you by approximately 9 people. BRAVO CO!!!!To those of you wondering if this game is not challenging enough for you compared to similarly-styled games, the answer damn well may be yes. If you want something as ""deep"" as the SimCity series, give the modders a few months to crank out some difficulty adjustment mods and a disaster mod (currently there are no large-scale disasters in the game, just local fires, sickness, etc). For $30, this game is an absolute steal - but it's going to get a LOT better in the next year as the modders dig their teeth in, so I wouldn't blame anyone for waiting til then to jump in."
81,63.0,Recommended," March 11, 2015",2,"An amazing City Building game that takes personalization to another level! There's a lot of content, enough to have you playing for hours and hours. Most people viewing or playing this game have been introduced to SimCity so I'll break it down. There is more content in this game than in SimCity and it's also HALF the price that was at launch. The Map Sizes, with the current mod, can be up to 25 times the map size in SimCity, most computers cannot handle that though so it's a do at your own risk which is fine. The graphics are great and it runs flawlessly on my i7 4790k. The content for this game has unlimited potential in the future. Basically if you like City Builders and Simulators than this is the game for you, it's what SimCity and Cities XXL should have been, hands down (: Also there really isn't any bugs, at least none that I've experienced so far."

293,108.0,Recommended," August 21, 2015",2,"My mayoral skills were impressive. In a short time I'd grown my little hamlet from just a few hundred residents into a gleaming city of 70,000 people. But suddenly, it all fell apart. My garbage collection services ran into a problem: the roads leading to my district of landfills and incinerators couldn't handle the vast amount of garbage trucks coming and going from all corners of the city. An enormous traffic jam started - unnoticed at first - eventually cascading into every corner of the city, completely locking down the road system. Fires raged through the down town high-rises because the fire fighters couldn't make it past the traffic. Sick people started dying in their homes because ambulances couldn't get to their door. As the bodies piled up and the buildings burned down, complaints rolled in and people started abandoning the city as quickly as they could.Where Skylines truly shines is in its focus on transportation management. As my story at the beginning showed, poorly planned roads can destroy your city once it outgrows the infrastructure. Fortunately, you have scads of options to manage your transportation. You can build underground or elevated roads, low or high volume streets (including one-way streets!), bus stations, subways, trains, and more. Mass transit becomes incredibly important as you quickly realize you want to get as many cars off the streets as possible, and you'll find yourself building pedestrian pathways to make it easy for your citizens to walk everywhere. You can easily spend the majority of your time fiddling to find the most optimal traffic solution if you want to - and sometimes you'll need to, as the game will harshly punish you if your traffic infrastructure can't handle your people.The game also introduces the concept of ""districts"". In the Sim City games you were able to enact laws and policies that effected the city as a whole, but in Skylines you can create individual districts and then enact policies on a district level if you don't want them to impact the entire city. This allows you to build a booming business sector with tax breaks for commercial zoning and free public transport while banning truck traffic and high rises in a quiet residential neighborhood.I unabashedly adore Cities: Skylines. Despite that, there are still some issues I have with the game - issues which, granted, have been addressed by mods, but still need to be added as official features.Pedestrian pathways were very exciting to me as a long-time Sim City player. The transportation options haven't ever allowed you to build a ""walkable"" city. In Skylines, while you can build them to allow your people to walk everywhere, you can't place buildings or zones off pedestrian pathways, which means that citizens have to use the path to walk to a road to go to a building. They essentially just allow you to place shortcuts connecting roads and don't let you create any sort of walkable city area.You also don't have any fine-tuned control over your intersections. Given how essential a proper road layout is, you'd expect to be able to designate turn lanes, cross-walk locations, and whether your want an intersection to have traffic signals or not. As it is, intersections are automatically created and you have no control over what exactly they look like. This can be very frustrating if you're trying to optimize your traffic flow.Planting trees is also a pain, as you can only place individual trees - there's no way to place mass amounts with a brush, and it's sorely needed.None of those problems have lessened by enjoyment with the game, and indeed, most of them arose only after spending many hours playing.."
87,12.9,Not Recommended," October 24, 2017",2,"Probably the best city simulator at the moment. The game is complex, innovative and downright addictive. Graphics are pretty and well made. This game could have been really great if it weren't for the dlc's Paradox keeps on releasing. Adding one distinct building doesn't make my gaming experience better in any ways. If they were to release a dlc which only contains one building they should make it free in my opinion. Buy this game when it's on sale and if you're into simulation games otherwise pass and look for another city simulator."

The Cities feel so alive and you might wanna follow someone, and see your citizens driving to work, visiting soccer games, taking the dog for a walk and many other activities.There are many dlcs for Cities: Skylines, but judge for yourself. I only bought the After Dark dlc yet and it sure looks great, but for a dlc which mostly just gives you a day and night cycle, with nice lighting, it's a proud price to pay. A day and night cycle could just be part of the game from start.But also without any dlc the game is great and has a nice modding community, where you get a lot of things to add. Or you might teach yourself to work with the editor and create your own buildings, parks and roads."

63,116.4,Recommended," September 9, 2016",2,"Recommended purchase.The idea behind other city simulations finally done better in every aspect. Additionally deep, but not overwhelming, and complex, but not complicated, with a well designed and easy to use and accessible UI. Simply endless fun.If you are looking for city simulators, you can look at all the others - you found the best one here with Cities: Skylines, no doubt and by far.Now, a year after release, there is even a whole scene of YouTubers, who use the unlimited money mod of this game and spend all their time mainly with the design features of the in-game city editor and who then use the city simulation component of the game only to bring life to the backdrop of their creations - much like building a model railroad, only in your computer and way cooler.If you want to just casually play a few hours and create a small town, or if you intend to go deeper into the concepts, that depends practically only on you, on what you want to do with the game. Both seems to be possible with the game, for one part probably because of the game's accessibility.I've bought it shortly after release, about a year ago, and unfortunately didn't play with it since (only 20hrs seeing if it works), until recently.Now, after a three week vacation, one year and two DLC packs later, I can see bazillions of workshop items to enhance the game, tutorials of varying depth and orientation on video platforms and in written form on Steam/reddit/imgur, that can help mastering the challenges of the game with less experimenting and more method and intent from your side. A lot of people have shared their experiences online, go look..During these past three weeks I've spent about 40 more hours with Cities: Skylines, additionally about 10 hours of reading up on actual urban planning science and watching a number of videos from more experienced gamers. Yes, Cities: Skylines is a game, and because of that it is of course a simplified version of reality. The game's challenges are still very much oriented in the real world challenges of urban planning and you can actually verify your own ideas on how to solve any of these situations of growth and tackle the multicausal nature of your city situation.Also, probably because the game's background simulation is much more complex under the hood than it may seem on the surface, every city you may create is an individual bunch of problems and you'll never find any magic bullet solution for any of your problems anywhere. It's amazing to see how playing the game more systematically can enhance your world view.There's usually far more than one way to do things in the game, the creators seem to have encouraged this by their game design and also seem to have encouraged the community to be creative and enhance the game with mods. Under the hood of the game everything looks fairly modern, my fast i7 4GHz gaming rig is actually doing some work here and I haven't even reached the 2^16 simulation agent limit, yet.Anyway, because of its fine surface polish, low price, peaceful and educationally valuable content, this game can be recommended to anyone anyway. It's a fine game no questions asked, no matter for who or how you look at it. It think there can be not much substantial doubt in this. That's why I thought I'd owe this game at least a review, as it is a masterpiece in every aspect I can think of. And I think it was not just one head who created this game, it feels like many people put their best together successfully to create this game.It's especially recommended for people, who look for more than just a timesink and it can probably easily be like that. I think, I'm learning a lot for my life, like multitasking, making better decisions, being more disciplined - just by playing this game. A perfect gift.There's just one other game I know of that I could easily spend hundreds of hours with, and already did. Cities: Skylines is another one in this rare kind.I'm really amazed by what Colossal Order created here and I'm thankful for their efforts. It delivers on pretty much everything I've been waiting for since 1989 and more. Thank you!"

It is the only game since simcity 4 in 2003 to achieve this excellent of a complete city managing system, and is equally as supported by some of the best mods on steam. I struggle to think of enough superlatives to describe this game.(warning, it is a very cpu heavy game, not on the gpu. It also eats up ram, a large city would easily use 12gb on its own. If you're sitting on 8gb or less, i would strongly recommend upgrading to 16gb as you will see significant frame increases.)Furthermore, For what feels like the $100 game simcity was going to be, this thing's only $30!! Simcity 2013 was the first and last preorder i ever made, and i feel now that I spent the $30 on simcity, and the $100 on Cities Skylines. Because that is what those two games are worth.You would be a fool not to buy it."

Huge maps, the ability to create districts with different governing policies, and the budget management that was lacking in other games exists here. The transit system creation (down to being able to place the lines, and add express trains to busy subway tracks, etc, and the ability to create unique highway interchanges and road paths make this game come to life more than most city building games ever have."

54,303.8,Recommended, March 4,2,"==OVERVIEW==I had never played a city builder before this. But I have a personal grudge with EA so I refuse to buy anything from them so never tried any of the Simcity series.Then I learn of cities skylines and I find that lo and behold its on sale. As I wanted to try a city simulator I bought it to try out. That night instead of going to bed at midnight, I was up to 7 am when I finally went to sleep. It can be that addicting, I would of bought it at full price had I known.So this is a fantastic game, and approaching 300 hours on it I can say its been worth all of it. The game isn't flawless mind you, but its pros far outweigh its cons.==PROS==Ease of use - The game is very easy to pickup. There is an included tips bar for beginners but its pretty easy to intuit what you need to do without it. The interface is clearly labeled if you hover over any button. Not once did I feel i had to consult an online guide until I was trying new an crazy ideas.Sound - Sounds effects are generic and eh, sounds of traffic and the like. But the music is highly atmospheric and while simple its satisfying. Beyond the music there are various ""radio stations"" you can pick with some humorous radio hosts and decent songs, both original and licensed. Normally when building things I listen to my own music but for this game i tend to just listen to the game's sounds.Editors - Don't like how something looks? Need a specific type of road or park? The game includes many content editors build in. I have been making custom road types to fill in the gaps the developers left. And let's be fair to them, there is no way they could every type of road possible without disastrously cluttering up the UI. But you can also import your own models to add, really, whatever you want to the game. The terrain editor is easy to use for making your own maps. There are still editors I've yet to use but my outlook for them is hopeful.Workshop - Made something with the above editors? The steam workshop interface is fantastic and easy to get whatever you made available for others. And its easy to search to find what you are after, assuming of course someone has made it. From mods to buses it lets you expand your game considerably.Mods - I'm no modder so I can't talk about ease of modding the game but as for ease of using the mods, its one of the easiest I have encountered. Simply subscribe to the mod you want on the workshop and turn it on in the game's conent manager, in the main menu. No manipulating files, not confusing setups, just click and done. And the community mods generally fix most of the in game cons.==CONS==Traffic AI - Let's talk about easily the most frustrating part of this game, Traffic. While making the city is great and all but traffic is the lifeblood to make the city function. And the traffic has horrible AI. It picks the shortest route when it starts, and come hell or high water it will stick to the route if the player hasn't removed or changed the road in route. Which means if there is a problem in route it will just back up. You also can't control how lanes connect at interest ions which makes it very difficult to try to direct traffic. All you can do is place roads and pick if an interaction has a light, which sides have stop signs, or if its unregulated. Real life cars have access to traffic reports so they can talk alternative routes, it would be nice to see that in this game. Or if ""residential"" cars were more savvy as to the bad roads the ""new"" or ""tourist"" cars.Annoying Building Requirements - This is more a personal gripe then a real flaw. There are unique buildings you can make in the game, such as malls, telescopes, etc. But they all have some sort of building requirements. Not just space and cost but to unlock them you have to do some, odd tasks. The good news is these tasks carry across all maps so once you do it once you have the building for good. But making this happen... Some are simply, like have X amount of a type of building. Some require a certain event to happen. but the frustrating ones are when you have to have ""X condition for Y amount of time."" And example is to get the Lazert Plaza you have to bring your entire city to low average health, which is a tall order in and of itself difficult without killing everyone, but you have to maintain it for several weeks which is hard as the population dies or leaves the number of remaining people is more healthy, so the average health rises.Chirpper - Chirpper is then in game messenger the citizens use and is an obvious parody of twitter. Sometimes this is useful as it lets you know about problems, like part of the city doesn't have running water. But the vast majority is flavor, like liking or not liking a zoning plan or decision you made. Its amusing to read once or twice, but it never stops. And there is no options for Chirpper other then the hat to give its interface.Mod-Limitation - While i love the modding, you are limited with how many mods it lets you run at once. Just let me run mods and its my fault if I put to many to run. This is compounded by several build in mods, like unlimited money and unlock everything are all separate mods and count as 1 each, so if you want them you cut down drastically on the number of community mods you can run.DLC Prices - While the game is good, the DLC prices can seem a bit obnoxious at times.==CONCLUSION==Yeah its got its flaws. But its a very fun experience which I would recommend to any city simulator fan, or someone wanting to try the genre out."

YesThe base game seems ok at first, then you start to realise how much is missing when compared to other sim city games of the last 30yrs... Want a few disasters to entertain you and murder some civs... PAY EXTRA... want to experience winter... PAY EXTRA... Want to expoerience night time in your city... PAY EXTRA.. want to have a single extra building.. PAY EXTRA... want another building.. PAY EXTRA.When I say PAY EXTRA... we're not talking about a few pemmies or pounds/dollars here and there... here in the UK, we are talking a MINIMUM of £10 for each of the following Winter/Disasters/After Dark and even more for the newest Green Cities... and if you want some extra buildings... PAY EXTRA AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN.I think you get the idea... The base game is in fact a stripped down, not as good as the original sim city of 30yrs ago... poor attempt at a sim game. Every decent idea was removed when they realised they could sell it for extra cash to those foolish enough to fall for their scams.There are some decent mods available from the steam workshop... but many of these are incompatible with updates to the game or require certain DLC's to function at all. So you are left with a game that frequently crashes because you don't have something a mod relys on... Not a good way to play so you end up removing virtually all community mods to stop the random crashes.So... IS IT VALUE FOR MONEY.. NO!!!.. In fact.. F*CK NO!!! You'd have to spend hundreds to get the full game.. and then get screwed again and again as they add new stuff down the road. They didn't even do the decent thing and release a season pass that gets you all new DLC as it's released... Because they know they can screw you more by charging you for EVERY LITTLE TINY EXTRA.Unless you can pick this game up including all of the DLC for less than £15-20 (30 USD) then DO NOT buy it.The devs are simply screwing over their customers, constantly releasing overpriced DLC that some muppets will rush out and buy like the sad little fanbois they are.Instead, keep your wallet/purse in your pocket/bag and save it until such a time as everything is greatly reduced.DO NOT reward greedy, deceitful and underhand practices by gaming devs/publishers because it will only encourage them to continue ripping people off."

Why can't you publishers just release a full game once? or if you release an unfinished game, at least make it early-access and all the buyers from the beginning should get the dlcs automatically (or make them free). i enjoyed this game in the beginning but after the release of the first 2 dlcs, i started feeling i am missing a lot of things and felt pressured to buy DLCs which i didn't ofc, and made me stop playing the game :)"

European capital? Futuristic city? A replica of your town?As of now, they've released two expansions: After Dark and Snowfall. They'll release more, and that's good, but there's no way to buy a game+expansions pack, which means that no one knows the pricetag for the ultimate experience, and you might end up spending hundreds of euros in the game if they keep releasing expansions. You might think ""how is that a problem? If they release more content, I'll happily pay"". Well, look at . Would you pay 4,000€ for the full experience?

If you have a quality PC you should have no issues running this game.You have 9 different maps to choose from. There is no random map option, but there is an editor included that you can create your own maps or download maps from other players. So, you will always have new maps to play on.The game has a few interesting subsystems that work together. The more educated your citizens are, the less trash they will produce. Poorer the neighborhood will lead to more crime. You have to keep your pollution levels down or you could risk tainting the drinking water of your citizens.There are multiple road options to allow you to truly customize the shape and direction of your town.Do you want to build a eco friendly paradise or do you want to build the biggest city that you can? The game gives you the tools for you to decide. Also, with the editors available there should be plenty of options coming from other players.For the old timers who remember Sim City on the SNES (I know it was PC first, but back then a SNES was a few hundred dollars and PC's were $2,000 easy) for everytime you reach a population milestone you level up your ability to add items to your city."

20,579.1,Recommended," April 6, 2017",3,"Cities: Skylines and it's various expansion packs are the tale of an indie developer's dream to create a game that many would assume is impossible for a small group to work on. While it's a great game overall, it's not without it's faults.PROS:From the creators of Cities in Motion, I present to you one of the most elegant transit construction systems in the game. The base game comes with buses, trains, subways (metros), boats, and airplanes. The expansions have added thus far streetcars (trams), taxis, and a variety of emergency air vehicles. The new Mass Transit expansion will add blimps, ferries, monorails, and aerial tramways (cable cars). Building and upgrading roads is a SNAP!Asset creators let you replace vehicles, buildings, and props... Resulting in a massive modding community for a variety of content... Some of it being made by yours truly.CUSTOM MAPS. Do you prefer a city by the bay or the little town in the valley. Are you a fan of small maps like me? The map creator is perhaps the most impressive tool in this game, as it allows you to create virtually any city you want.CONS:From the creators of Cities in Motion, I present to you the most screwball vehicle pathfinding in the game. While buses and the other public vehicles seem pretty intelligent, it's the citizens who can't seem to figure out how to drive around town. Then again, this has been a problem that has plagued the city-builder since the days of 3D games.Many people often state that Cities: Skylines is the ""real city-builder"" to SimCity 2013... As some one who has played both games for a very long time, I honestly say they are two different games that show the ultimate problem of the city-building genre.But as for Skylines, let's just say that it is ultimately the ""City Painter"" of the two. This is not in a mocking tone; with the variety of assets you can create/find as well with a few mods, you can create whatever city you can dream of. There are so many features and means to this game, it's surprising to see how such a small dev-team can pull it off. The large amount of space on the maps means you can create much more realistic cities, or simply opt to create several smaller towns spread across the region (as I do myself). You could even, with a mod, take a ride in a car and see your city from a citizen's point of view... That's how artistic and crafty this game is.But it comes at a price... The overall depth really isn't there. While you do have some challenges and moments where the game does test you (Natural Disasters adds in some curve balls especially), there overall isn't going to be a lot that happens unless you get careless. There's no economic catastrophes, no global market where prices on oil can cause a crisis, and no real reward for educating citizens outside of cleaner factories... As far as ""classic city-builder"" goes, the game is just that, but if you want more depth and see the cause and effects of say, a casino opening up shop or what happens when housing is built down-wind from factories, the other city builder I mentioned does that better at the cost of content and some complexity. But alas, has there ever been a city-building game that truly focused on economic stability and social factors as opposed to growth and profit?Ultimately, as a contributor to the workshop and a fan of city-builders, I recommend this game in the end despite not truly going as in-depth as I want it to. Yes, it's a bit pricey, but if you really want to build the biggest city imaginable or take a spin down your own highway through your very own take on Blade Runner's Los Angeles, this game will deliver on those goods. The dev team is committed to this game, and it has a very active group of players who create a variety of stuff everyday."

62,159.1,Recommended," June 5, 2016",3,"Visual style might not be appealing to everyone (it seemed quickly-put-together at first), but UI itself is consistent and it's pretty easy to get around all the game's aspects which is a very important aspect for this genre.It is pretty easy to learn (only took me like 5 restarts from scratch lol) and has great creative potential. You will be able to manage transport, provide education and jobs, terraform your peace of land (or buy a new one, pretty cheap too) and build canals and many other things while the little bird at the top of the screen shows you how pleased your citizens are and if there are problems.The game also appears to support mods extensively which is bound to please us PCMasterricers.Pick it up along with 'After Dark' DLC (taxis and some other pretty-important stuff) and you will easily waste dozens of hours in this game without flinching if you are the slightest bit into that sort of thing.chirper/10"

It gives You more options (f.e. buying another land spot next to Your city, to make Your city larger).8. Its published by Paradox, not EA, which means that each DLC will make a huge load of new possibilities insead of just 5 new buildings.The rest is nearly same like in SimCity 2013 ;)For me 9/10 - im sure ill spend over 40 hours playing it, and i will be comming back to this game from time to time after that."

A combination of the good parts of one city sim with another along with new features not yet made in any of those sim.The bad point ?- Localization suffers some typos/mistakes here and there, but it's still alright.- Tunnels can't be made ... A mod to fix that ? *winks at modders*- No building customization (giving it a continent style over another) ... Again, modders are there for that !The good point ?- Even after 4 hours, I still didn't fill the map and yet I could expand it more.- Easy to understand.- Traffic sim is quite alright, even though vehicles sometimes don't use all the road lanes for some reasons.- Limitation ?

However, this rendition on city building simulation takes it a step further than EA allowed Maxis to in that the game allows you to expand your city limits outwards and to zone districts with district-wide policy enforcement.

Obviously that does not say much when you compare what has come out since SC4 but still it is a great game. Roads that are curvable, the ability to make your own buildings (think BAT tool in SC4 but a ton easier to figure out and use), custom bus lines, custom train lines, custom subway lines, taxis, ferry service, expandable roads, click and follow cars/pedistrians ...It is not perfect mind you, the ability to bulldoze and flatten land does not exist (well it does on slopes with low % grades, but you want to flatten a mountain, that is not happening as no option to do it).Also, once you reach 8 expansions of your city limits that is it. No option to buy land past that (at least that I have found). That said 8 extensions is a lot but would be nice to build more. Right now I have a city at 110K population though it has been there for a while. Thing is there is a huge online community that has gives tons of FREE downloadable content which makes the game interesting. Currently I am on 92 plus hours and still loving it. Just downloaded the expansion AFTER DARK (that costs money in case you were wondering) but it gives more eye-candy and transport options.I currently give it an 8.5/10 which says a lot as it is rare I ever give a game 8 or higher."
201,100.5,Recommended, February 6,3,"The most addictive and off-putting game in my library... Also Paradox are Greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥sWhy is it addictive you ask? Well no matter what you do there are almost always problems; traffic, housing, industry, schooling, poor people, and much much more. These problems are so enticing to solve, the more you play the more you become invested in your city. You can go back to your first road, first, neighboorhood and that one horrible glob of roads that you want to call an intersection. Being able to look back on the small roots of where your city started from and how its blossomed into a thriving metropolis after grueling hours of planning and hard work, is amazing and gives an awesome feeling of real progress that is hard to find in games.Why is it off-putting? Because there is always the urge to start a new, there is always that burning feeling in the back of your mind that you could do it better if you only started off better. This is not really the fault of the game developers but its more of a result of the game itself. A small warning to anyone thinking about purchasing you will restart countless times in pursuit of perfection just keep building on what you have it's not worth starting over.Paradox are greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, I paid 30 dollars for this and I don't regret it at all but with all the DLC that is out now for the game some of it seems almost essential to run an efficient and ""good city"". Just give out some free updates paradox (I'm talking about some of the music DLCs, like really paradox ???)"

293,33.8,Recommended," March 11, 2015",3,"If you were in any way disappointed by SimCity, you should buy this game. The design shows a passion and love for what makes city-building games great, and the execution is near flawless.The road building tool is absolutely amazing. It is powerful enough to let you solve traffic issues logically, rather than figuring out work-arounds, or just suffering through traffic. That's not to say it's easy, it does constantly present thought provoking puzzles. But each issue with traffic has a HUGE number of solutions, and each one is fun to implement since the tool is so well designed. In fact, just designing interchanges is a blast.The new district feature is the best thing to come to city building games since map creation (also included btw). The control it gives you over your city allows you to build the city you want.The dynamic water adds some incredible life to the maps, which changes as your city grows and you make changes.City expansion makes planning much more complex and fluid than previous city building games. You will find that old strategies have to be rethought in a more realistic way.You can legalize drugs.There are a few bugs, but none are even close to game breaking. No need to wait for a patch, or servers. In it's current state it is the best city-sim I have ever played. I've only been able to play for a few hours so far, but I'm excited to get to the weekend and sink quite a few hours into this gem.9.5/10"
47,849.1,Recommended, February 14,3,"Best City Planning & Management Game.Planning on a side, is a major element of the game and it always challenges your common-sense and creativity. You need to decide where and how to best direct your inbound and outbound traffic to and from specific areas/districts; industry zone, a landmark or a special building of a DLC. You could save your city so many problems with proper traffic planning.Managing the city is the second major element. You can choose up to which level of details (simulation) you want to go. If you wish, you can fine-tune your budget expedintures for Electricity service at night, or you can leave your default budget figures intact and focus on designing and planning the city only.Your city can be a success if you simply planned it and managed it well. However, if you're a details-oriented person, you'll discover a different level to enjoy the game as you'll take care of your city's aesthitics or creat a sim version of your own real city. You'll also enjoy Steam Workshop and it's content. They add huge flexibility to your city building experience and can add a lot to your futuristic city design theme. If you're a genuine geek :)"

Skylines sadly fails to deliver. It's the same game as back in 2015.The DLC are a pure cashgrab, as expected from Paradox.Radio stations: 4€ for some background music. Play a youtube playlist in the background for free.Content creator Packsand Stadiums: 5€ for something you can get for free from workshop in better quality.After Dark: 15€ adds day/night cycle and better control over existing systems. A somewhat hefty price for polish to a game.Snowfall: 13€ covers all in snow and adds need for snowplows working exactly like garbage trucks while not improving the service vehicle ai in the slightestas well as heating. Nothing a mod couldn't have done.Natural Disasters: 15€ to have your city destroyed by random or preset disasters.Mass Transit: 12€ to include features mods added in a more polished fashion back in 2015.While some DLC might be worth their money during 75% summer sale the general pricing and maintaince of this game certainly does not warrant recommending this game."

30,207.6,Recommended, February 6,3,"Well, where do I begin? This game is a piece of art. The molding, modeling, and overall feel of creating your city are amazing. The intricate roads, traffic, and demands system really bring a new depth to the game. Along with aspects of rush hour, weekends, day-night cycles, and even services depending on the very complex network of roads, rails, and the subways that you set up.This game has it all. It even charts, tracks and gives each person on the street a different life. Where to go, jobs, housing, and income. Taxes that are affected by not only what you have but also land value and more. The Game has so many aspects and complex things alone. Once you add mods and DLC the feeling it gives is unreal. when playing this game I feel less like a player and more like a god.Being able to build, design, and progress a city to the point where it feels like your own masterpiece. It even has complex aspects of mixing industry between residential areas to allow for better commute times, employment, and even efficiency. Then there is the polices aspect of the game, a great way to manipulate a certain section of your city, by breaking them into a district and adding rules and regulations. Along with these aspects come the facts that your city grows at the pace you play. Using taxes and other methods one can lower raise and even steady the demands and flow of people into your city. Now thought the thing that tops this all and adds the absolute best aspects of this game is the physics. We are talking real water physics hear you can flood your city not by just magically raising water levels and it appearing but by water actually flowing, evaporating, and moving in waves.That is just the water thought there is even wind speed, direction, and temperature. These all affect the game as a whole. Wind can actually move pollution to certain areas. Thie effect both the water and the people. If water becomes polluted upstream it effects everything you have downstream. All this stuff together is still just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to this game. So now here begs the question should you buy this game.YES YES AND YES. This game is worth every penny. For a city building / God game it is one of the most complex, aesthetically pleasing, and fulfilling game out there I give this game a 4.5 out of 5 stars. Now you might be asking wait where is that other .5 start well there is one shortcoming of this game. The rate at which it crashes. It needs some optimization and fixes overall. Especially when it comes to CPU and ram usage.I have an eight-core processor with 32Gs of ram and the game still takes a hit in the AI area. It also uses none of my RAM and runs on only a single core. However, if these things do happen to get changed in the future I would be more than ecstatic to change my rating from a 4.5 to 5 out of 5 Starts."

(i do not dare to mention this in RL ;)).it is not hard to have a balanced budget, it is not hard to keep your people happy, there are no elections, etc. consider this game much more technical. that is what i love about this game. with all the mods and possibilities, this is a game for people who like logistics, who like networks, who like model railways, who like love for details. graphics are just stunning, but only if you use the right mods and a high end computer.it is hard to build fluent infrastructural network. the game has a built in mechanism, which makes cars stuck in traffic jams for too long just disappear. i do not understand why, because if you turn this ""feature"" off by mod, this game gets really interessting. it is possible to create fluent networks without cars disappearing, you just have to do a good job.so, the vanilla version is above-average, but the modding compatibility combined with the community makes this game just incredible. this should be used as an example for all other game developers. like this, you keep a game alive for years."

275,50.3,Recommended," November 2, 2015",3,"Cities: Skylines ReviewIntroductionCities: Skylines is an utterly fantastic game. Paradox to this day has still never failed to deliver a great game. C:S as I will be calling it in this review is by far the greatest city-builder in it's genre. The realism of the game's details is striking and the way you handle your city's economics is not hard at all. Some people (like myself) will compare this to SimCity: Cities of Tomorrow, and at this point it's safe to assume the C:S has blown it out of the water. I'll put it here in bold: C:S is the better buy over SimCity: Cities of Tomorrow. The last EA game that I consider any good at all, was SimCity 4: Deluxe Edition. I've never throughoughly enjoyed a game that was produced by EA after that.Now C:S; yes, there are DLC's. Yes, they are paid for; but here's the beef on that. The base game is so good that the DLC's are out there to futher customize your city. And not cosmetically (essentially), I'm talking like, take for instance Match Day (which is the only free one at this point), it adds a Soccer stadium to the game. Yes it costs alot, yes it looks cool, and yes it actually does something. Your city must be able to handle the traffic flow of people coming in to see games in the stadium. The game events will cause massive influxes of money, but you have to be able to handle it. Point is, the DLC's in this game are useful (except maybe Snowfall, which has a heck a'lot of snow).General GameplayThe eccentricity of C:S compared to other games is incredible. Here I will discuss how and why it is. C:S offers many, many game mechanics that were never seen in previous city builders. One blatent example is the Steam Workshop. C:S has the ability for the community to create new content for the game and upload it so that others can incorporate it into their cities as well. Yes, SimCity 4 had assets (and dependencies, ahhhhhhhh dependencies), but you had to go through all the generic troubles of installing through directories and have the right dependencies (AHHHH). In C:S you check a box. Boom.C:S in-game mechanics include real-time water. I love this feature. I think it's one of the best mechnics in the game. SimCity 4 has water, but it doesnt...really....move. C:S does, and it moves! If you build a dam for hydroelectric energy, you better make sure that it was placed properly because (coming from personal experience) if you don't, and the water level behind the dam surges up and over the river banks and into your city and suddenly you lose half the populous of your city and then there's like no money, and a crap city, then oh well, you done did bad. That is what makes C:S so good. Your decisions make a direct impact on your society (not to say that you can direclty place this kind of house on this kind of zone (and correction, that is possible through assets in the Steam Workshop)).I don't think it's possible to right a review on this type of game without saying that there is quite a bit of a learning curve. C:S has a pretty big learning curve. Each city starts out with 2 highway connections. 1 incoming, and 1 outgoing. The way to plan this first part of your city will be your money maker. If you plan it badly, then your traffic will cause you some headache when you go to fix it and the placement of certain buildings like medical facilites and schools will make you lose money when you discover that they were placed in an area that won't let you upgrade a road, or something of that nature.Keeping on with the learning curve and moving into traffic. Traffic is another animal in this game. Yes, you have to worry about the flow of traffic in your city, becuase if your incoming traffic is being clogged up with trucks and what not becuase they are making this crazy turn in an intersection, it's safe to assume that you can change that into something more useful. The flow of traffic in your city needs to be carefully managed. Traffic is money. Outgoing goods from your industry earns your city money. So does incoming goods to commercial zones. You need to have an efficient route through your city if just passing through and so forth. C:S has spent a good amount of time developing this system and I have to admit, I'm still a little flumouxed on getting certain parts of my city to flow like they should.Last section in mechanics I want to talk about. Land Value. Ever since release, Paradox has added some amazing and cool looking things into the game. Canals for instance (yes, there are canals, and quays (keys), and other environmental tools) will provide a serious land value bonus to an area. The more desireable the city, the more people come, and the more people come, the more money you make. It's a very pleasing sight to see all that green in an area after you plop down a canal and the water is in there (not overflowing into your city as I have had before). The enviornmental set itself is a very intersting tab. Say you are designing a city not for the heck of playing the game, but because you want to design the most cool looking city you can (and you can, with the infinate money mode (screw the citizens!)), take ""Strictoaster"" on YouTube for example. He is a urban designer, that not only does it as his job, but in games such as C:S (his favorite) and Planet Coaster. His work is phenominal. It's a real testiment to the powerful game that C:S is.C:S is incredibly detailed. If you were to zoom in all the way onto a road, you could see the minute rocks and pieces of stuff that goes into making a road, IN THE ROAD. When it rains, there is flowing water on the sidewalks, and roads. Citizens will pull out their umbrellas and hats (some are caught off-guard and pull out a newspaper over the head). Not to mention the nighttime graphics. I think the best time a city is in the full screenshotting glory (unless you have a beefy computer (That is, better than this one I have)), is at night. The towering lights of skyscrapers, orange glows of the avenue street lights, and the sky-shining lights of suspension bridges over heavy waters. All of that is just incredibly well designed.I will have to throw this in there. C:S does require a bit of a good computer to get the game looking good. Playing it on a 1.4GHz i5 with integrated intel HD 5000 graphics doesn't do much for you (saying that from experience after looking at longer loading times, trees that look like pieces of plastic, and distance rendering that looks like blobs of paint on a box). I would suggest you actually read the system requirements to get the game running.C:S is a city builder. The sheer amount of time you spend refining your city is enough to keep me realing on one map for weeks. C:S has an infinate amount of hours in it. Theoretically, as long as you don't get bored of it. As soon as you've spent that 3 month period on a city, and you have that feeling that you've done your best and it's done, you can simply start up a new one. On a new map. Or a community created one.Mechanics: 8/10Visuals: 9/10Gameplay: 8/10Quality over SC:CoT: 10/10**Thanks for reading that, that's the longest review I've ever published. :P"

The game it's self you'll most likely find very easy if your a big Sim City player (other then dealing with traffic which is the core of large city developement) .I played it to the point where there was nothing new to build and the game became a balance of just building more. It's okay. It fills the niche that Sim City dropped the ball on, but nothing more. If your looking for a Sim City type game to get abosrbed in, sure this is a game for you, but that's it."

Cities Skylines is great fun, and far less frustrating to play as well.So far I'm loving how innovative and creative you can be with roads, creating small walking paths right up to super complex highway systems, and it all works perfectly. The game is fairly easy so far, and I've expanded my city fast, but it's still only about an eighth it's full potential size.Some things are missing. No modular buildings, no day/night cycle, and the graphics are *slightly* less impressive than Sim City. But with the amount of mod support, I imagine any and all issues can and will be overcome very quickly.I recommend this for anyone who loves city sims, and may have been disappointed by Sim City."

The game seemed good after I watched some gameplay and saw the reviews.I felt like I was about to fall alseep after a few hours of gameplay so I checked how much the DLC costed and immediately said ''Hell no''. Workshop time, loads of mods, I install a few mods and some assets, 30 min load time. I wanted to die. Once I loaded in, I turned down the Dynamic Resolution with a MOD, you can't use that basic feature in the base game oml. So I built a city, actually enjoyed it this time, then I got off after a few hours. Got back on the next day, pretty sure the load time was longer, so I persevered, the LAG was unbearable since I didn't restart my PC before loading into the game. Restarted my PC, tried to load in and cried because of the atrocious load time.Most of my time spent has probably just been me loading into the gameCannot recommend, $13.99 for trams and snow, cannot Canada Simulator5/10 game"
62,350.0,Recommended," April 28, 2017",3,"Ok, 50 hours in game and i am ready to make some comments.Firstly, I am not new to citybuilders. I have played most from SimCity series to the ceaser/roman series so i have some experiencewith this style of game.Firstly, I Must say, for a game that is supposed to enjoy mod support,Mods cause MOST of the problems that i have encounterd in my 50or so hours. Some would say, forget mods, play the vanilla. Faircomment, except You kind of need them to adress some of the majorissues/bugs in the game.Ok, Your first problem is going to be ""how to get utility vehicles towork properly?"" Short answer, You just can't. Ther are many modsthat claim they can but most have been abandoned by there creatorand not updated so... They WILL crash your game of cause Gfx issues.You can almost never tell witch ones will work so you will have to resortto the ""suck it and see"" method. To be fair, there are MANY cerative soulswho have blessed us with literally thousands of player made assets,IE buildingstrain stations, All sorts of stuff to make your city look great. Sadly as with themods, many go un updated and will crash your game*. So Mod at your own risk.Second strike, Taxes are your ONLY source of income. Most games of this typeusually have some buildings to generate extra income. Not this one. I thinkyou get something for transit, bus, train etc but from what im told and seenmyself you rarely break even let alone generate profit.Third strike, Vehicle AI is abysmal. On a 6 lane h/way ALL the traffic will convergeinto 1 lane totally ignoring the outher 5. Including service vehicles such as garbagepolice, fire and EMS.Fourth, Road building. If you like nice crisp grids then Ha ha ha Good luck.It is hard and requires a lot of practice to get any good at it. so try ""random"" placings.Your first few citys will look like you did anyway.. Lol. You can only zone 4 tiny squaresoff ANY roads except h/ways witch you can't zone off at all.Fifth, If you want to use mods, Male sure you have a really good computer.It takes at least 4GB RAM just to launch a vanilla map... Don't even try witha single/dual core CPU or a GPU less than a GTX9something or less than 8GB Ram. Whilst you may get it to run, it will lag and get very choppy as your FPSdrops off the scale.There are many outher issues to numerous and too small to mention hereso we will end the negitive part of the review.So, What i like about the game.With the right system, It runs very well and is easely the best looking gameof this type i have ever played. For me it actually runs really smooth andyour citys look great, especially at night. You CAN use mods, with the rightsystem and there are some terriffic mods/assets/maps made by playersin the steam workshop. Modding through the workshop is smooth andreally easy. Creating your own custom maps/assets is simple too with theeditors provided. Some major improvements over games like simcity.first, free zoning, Great night/day cycle, and much better visually andthe editors. there aretoo many outhers to list here.The 2 best things i LOVE about CS is continued dev support in the formof patches,updates and cool new DLC's. The community so far thoughis the best feature. As a new player i was on the forums, asking the dumbnewbie questions we noobs ask and... No rude comments, no trolling/baitingNo real badwill at all. Just helpful advice and encouragement. No stupidquestions, just helpful advice. Thanks to all who replied to my posts BTW.Do i recommend this game.. Well.. To a gamer who has experience withthis style of game or any game that requires TONS of micromanagementthen an Emphatic YES.. Buy it now, you will love it.To anyone else who want's a more casual gaming experiance, probablynot. to those (you know who you are) with the attention span of a goldfish(or do you remember He he he) Stay right away. You will hate it.I can see myself enjoying this game for a long time Bugs regardless.I payed full price with no regrets.EDIT: After 150+ hrs now i can finish this review.Firstly The free patch relesed with the mass transit DLC has gone a long waytowards fixing most of the issues i have had so far. Most of the gfx issues are fixed,The load speed is a little better And road bulding is much more precice.So, Most of the upgrades were inspired by the major mods in the game,This shows the dev's take notice and care what is happening in game andrespond to it. This has not negated the use of mosd but has made the vanillagame a lot more playable for the more casual player.Another plus is ALL the major mods have been updated since the free patch so..WOOHOO....In short, this has gone from being a good playable game to an exellent exampleof what a citybuilder can be if the dev team care enough. It is pretty clear that they do.As stated in my original review, the community is still the best part of this game.This is now on my HIGHLY recommended list.Disclamer: This review is MY personal opinion only.NOTE: I like the fact all content inspired by playermade mod's was in thefree patch. I dig the integrity."

379,83.6,Not Recommended," April 3, 2015",653,"Before you read everything:If you want a good looking, easy city building sandbox, don't mind my rating and just go ahead and buy the game.It is definitely not a totally bugged or bad game or total rip-off :)And for some time I had definitely fun with it and still might in the future.Otherwise continue reading:FYI:Some minor stuff has been fixed. And although I did not play with the newest patch released some days ago yet, most issues which annoy me are - according to patch notes - still there.When rating the game, I do so without mods. And without, the game gets pretty fast boring (for me) if you want more than just a ""build the prettiest city sandbox"". In my opinion mods are great for enhancing replayability or making smyller adjustments - but they should not become a necessity.And even though I had to think a long time about it, I still find my negative rating fitting.When I started playing it I really love the game:- graphics is not overwhelming but looking good, giving a nice city building flair- sound is soothing and does not get onto one's nerves- relatively good balanced progress- not feeling too fast or slow and I only seldom sped up the time- building/maintenance costs are fine- tax management simple but still ok- love how water/energy systems works (not too simple, not too much micro-management)- street system is doing good- district system nice, especially with the different resources for industry- actual water physics simulation! Building a hydro dam(n) needs real planning (and some testing, save your game ;) )Then I found some flaws; the in-game message chirper is kind of annoying (and badly placed btw), it's ridiculous to not being able to scroll with holding right mouse button, some view management is sorta weird and transportation volumes are not realistic.This is where the mods come in: for all those and more minor issues I found good working fixes in the workshop and from what I saw, some of the issues were fixed in the past, so in time you might even be able to go without them.But - here it comes - in the long run, the game does not fit my needs.In general it's too easy. After some harder times (in terms of cash problems) in the beginning, it gets pretty easy as soon as you get to use the high density zones. In my second city, I had a plus of 10k+/week. Even though I kept building here and there and making everything looking nice, I was not able to spend my money faster as I got it.Up until then it is real fun. But from this point, it is making the game a bit too sandbox-like with the focus on ""how to make it look nice"" and without the hassle for careful planning how and where to expand the city.Besides this, there are some really down-bringing issues in the game, that get more un-nerving in the long run.These are mostly unrealistic behavior or balance issues:- Electricity production is a joke. From the beginning, wind-energy is in term of $/W not only cheaper than any coal or gas plant, but also non-polluting. As soon as you get the solar power plant, you don't have to worry about energy at all, as it is even cheaper. Also neither wind nor sun energy has differing output, like dynamic wind speed or clouds. So there is no reason at all to not build wind/solar plants- The resource system does not have a real depth: Yes, you can set specific districts for agriculture, ore, oil or forest industry. But besides more/less tas and pollution (and different buildings, obviously), there is no really meaning in that. Yes, you can use the oil for your oil energy plant, but why? Wind is still cheaper. And there is no big difference in export or anything, too.- While the water pollution system is nice, the land pollution is very very friendly. Have a coal power plant? Well, pollution only spreads about one-two blocks - after that you can build residences again.- AI for garbage and death care needs improvements. Death care: In larger cities (30k+), there are continually areas where dead people wait for transport to the crematory or grave yard - even if you have enough of them and they are not using all of their vehicles yet. Garbage: Trucks are working (yes, SC in your face :D ) but the system to send the garbage from a full dump to a incineration plant is not good. Even the old SC4 was working better in that case.- UI/views. I still cannot click a street and see who is going where, like SC4 rush hour -> this might improve the generally nice transportation system a lot!- The game lacks in terms of content: some areas (medicine) are great - others (power, industry resources, politics, tourism, ..) have too few buildings/possibilities.- Simulation is not realistic enough/goes not deep enough. Too easy power simulation, too easy fire/crime/medicine/education system, no real impact of industry/resource choices, etc.If you want to just build a nice city, go ahead. I had a great time so far with the game. Had to install a few mods for that, but with them it is fun for some time.If you expect a nice city builder simulation, maybe it's better to wait for a DLC/the next part. Seeing that the game seems to be quite successful in terms of sold copies, I guess there is a good chance for one or the other :)"

It's eerily similar to Payday 2, where they had a great game and then milked it to no end for every last penny. Snowfall? Natural Disasters? After Dark? These should either be a part of the vanilla game or a singular expansion, not individual ~$15 DLC items. As for the Stadium and Content Creator DLCs, those are just ridiculous, it's like the Sims with endless ♥♥♥♥♥♥ DLC that's expensive and shouldn't be standalone.

This game does put Simcity anything to shame, and it is the best city builder I've played. However this game with all its glory has turned into a big pile of steaming horse $!^%. The optimization for the performance is still terrible dispite several updates for it. Little in the way of extra content has come out, and when it does it feels overpriced (I do not have Mass Transit yet). I can handle a little lag and some extended load times, not the major killer. This game died with the updated content manager that is supposed to make your life of controlling your mods from the workshop. This is me is the most buggy spot in the whole game. Trying to make a style, HA! impossible, everytime you add the asset to the style you want the list clears forcing you to re-search for the assests you want to add. This quickly becomes irritating. Even the simple act of selecting a mod can cause this. In my opinion the devs are♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥that that modders are making better content faster then they can, and i believe this because everytime I come back to this game im removing mods that are now a part of the game or added by the devs."

After that it is several hours of being unable to afford services like fire protection and ambulances until you finally enter an urban city which is far easier to manage.The game isn't perfect, but it is the best city builder on the market. It's cheap and given this studios track record we can expect a tonne of DLC development as well as post-launch balancing."

1,632.5,Recommended," March 13, 2015",4,"The game is a decent mix of the best features of Simcity 4, Simcity 5 and Cities XL.For such a complex product just after release the amount of bugs is very low, and they are actually minor bugs. Simcity 5 features better graphics, but you'll be compensated for that by a good perfomance and an overall highly addictive game. The interface is good (with some minor flaws), and the economy is a bit too easy too handle. It's 9/10 and by far the best city building game there is."
133,367.3,Recommended," March 10, 2015",4,"About time we have a good City Builder from a reputed company.After playing this for some time, here are some feedback compared to SimCity4: Deluxe.PRO:1. Game starts as expected. Build some roads, electric, water, and zones. Bulldozing gives money back instead of costing money.You don't spend money to zone or re-zone. You can easily lose if you screw up this part. A second failure point that can crop up at this stage is placing something now that creates a pollution hub later.2. There is a lot to manage but you start small - then as you get bigger, the more you need to manage. Progression feels good and appropriate for a game in this genre. Pacing is also smooth. The Pace is dictated by Milestones, as you reach certain goals in the game you get to purchase more land, unlock buildings and more upgrades.3. Mods in this game are pretty good in their potential. Anyone can make Assets or Maps.4. There is enough to simulate to entertain you but there isn't too much depth. The level of depth feels appropriate. Not dumbed down by any means.5. Lots of potential room for DLC, Expansions and more content WITHOUT being stripped down to nothing. This is not a half-game awaiting the rest in microtransactions.CON: No big flaws yet.1. Some parts of the UI are primitive. When you click to view Energy, Waste, Fire or Crime, it doesn't tell you how much money you are spending on it. So there is some juggling of one tab to the next.2. You cannot move or re-size the windows that open for you when you click buttons.3. The music could have a better presence. It is a bit quiet and often I hear nothing but birds.4. ""Forced"" to start small and build big from scratch. You ""can cheat"" if you like, but playing without cheats you cannot just start building a large city. Some people might dislike having the same starting situation evey single time on terms of what you can build and how you advance.Linear Progression is the rule of this Sandbox. Fortunately, you can advance in a non-linear way.Overall: 9/10. The only thing that could have made this game better is to have more control over the size of Zones - the ""Zones"" appear next to road types when you build roads. You don't place ""zones."" Once the road is placed and the ""Zone Spot"" appears next to the road, you may designate that as Residential, Commercial or Industial.This is the best City Builder on the market, period."
94,669.2,Recommended," March 10, 2015",4,"Cities: Skylines Review:I wrote down what my reaction was to each day I had the game up until the release date (March 10).Day 1(March 4th)(I received the game at about 9:00 PM EST, but failed to check my email, I checked my email at about 11:00 PM EST and immediately downloaded the game)As I opened the game it completely lost me in its blue color. I immediately started playing, I couldn't wait another second. I started my first city. As I look at the roads I notice that the only road I have unlocked is a 2way road. That made me confused. Why would I place a road just to delete it? What I mean is that I placed it on the highway ramps to come into/leave the city. As I place the 1 way 2 lane roads I think, ""Where do I start""? As I start to plan my city, my friend home rings, it is right next to me, completely ignore it. I could not move away. I played for about an hour before realizing I need to go to bed.Day 2(March 5th)I wake up at about 5:30 to 6:00 AM EST. I hurry to get myself ready, I'm about 25 minutes early than I usually am. What did I do? What do you think I did? I hopped back on Cities: Skylines. I played for about 20 minutes only to realize that I had to part from my computer. Once I came home I played for about 3:00 PM EST to 1:00 AM EST(10 hours) before going to bed.Day 3(March 6th)Played from about 7:00 AM EST to 1:00 AM EST. I could not stop playing! Built my city up and thought that I should start a new one. Started ""Stockholm"".Day 4(March 7th)I didn't get much playing time in, only about an hour total.Day 5(March 8th)Played about 10:00 AM EST to 11:00 AM EST and about 5:30 PM EST to 1:00 AM ESTDay 6(March 9th)Played a little. Maybe about 2 hours.As of this writing, I have played this game for 35.1 hours. So almost 1.5 days in 6 days. Wow. This game is great.Pros:The detail. The fact you can see ""poop water"" floating away is great.The water dynamics are really really good.The fact that you can run a small farm town instead of building up to a huge city is really really cool. Running a small farm town is great.Cons:Game doesn't run great on laptops, especially huge cities.Traffic is a little too congested on the graphs. What I mean is if you use the traffic info view traffic on a road/intersection is weighed to heavily towards the red.Traffic is a huge issue.Rank: 8/10Side effects of playing:AddictionHave an extremely fun time creating the city of your dreams"

68,262.5,Recommended," November 25, 2016",4,"Wow, Cities: Skylines... Where to begin...- Firstly, this game is the game that EA's Simcity should have been, except about 1000 times better. More buildings, more options, better gameplay mechanics and generally more everything!- Secondly, The gameplay and the customisation feature of this game are truely its strong point. With thousands of Workshop items, assets and vechicles created by a community of dedicated fans that are added to your game with a simple click. This adds a whole new level to a game which no other rival city builder can truely compare to. Did I mention that these Workshop add-ons are FREE???- Thirdly, The Developers ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT THE GAME. That is one thing that EA missed on with Simcity, EA just rode the current of their popularity river that the Sim series has created and as soon as the game was released, the game was mostly left to cough, splutter and die due to its lack of new features, AI problems and repetitiveness. Simcity did see a few updates but nothing compared to the love this game has recieved from the developers.This game has problems though, it has to be said. I have experienced problems during my play time, mainly around the stability on my PC, especially seeing as I am not running your typical /r/pcmasterrace beast machine. Asides from the occational lapse of framerate, crashes can occur. In the past, I have been left with a few hours of progress wiped because of foolishly not saving my progress. Collosial Order seem to have fixed this as crashes seem to happen less frequently then it used to but I do still see a occasional drop of FPS in my game, but again, I am not running an epic PC. Thinking of it, this game is so addicting that I have had to force myself to save or enable autosave.But that's really it, a lot of pros and a few tiny cons. Cities: Skylines is a must have for gamers who like Simulation games, City Builders, Moddable games and a whole lot of mircomanaging.EDIT (25/11/'16): I highly recommend buying the game with the extra DLCs. Although it will set you back a bit more, you will be supporting future development of the game and the extra features are mostly worth it. Think of it as a virtual highfive to the devs."

I was so happy for this game that I preordered it and I downloaded it and played it as soon as it became available. After a bit of time setting up towns, parks, commercial buildings and industrial areas I started to get that feeling of repitition. I built my town and everything is running great, I build my wonder building and I have alot of folk coming into my town. All my buildings are upgraded and all of this I did within 3 hours of play time. I feel as if the developers mostly focused on the road and traffic aspect of the game. It doesn't really matter what you build or where you build it, as long as there is not traffic you're fine.The 1 and only reason I dont recommend this game is because it gets repetitive after a short time span. The game itself is beautiful, the fact that I can zoom in and see such great detail is the only reason why I still play every once in a while."
242,160.6,Not Recommended," February 20, 2016",53,"Was one of my favourite games until it was ruined by the Snowfall DLC and free update which broke most of the core game mechanics, and the developers taking the decision to degrade the graphics (LOD distance and such) for no apparent reason resulting in a very blurry game (assuming it was to improve performance).If only rollbacks were possible. It was a good game on Day 1 but it has went downhill since with prominent issues not being fixed, pointless/cosmetic DLC being introduced, and the community being mostly ignored by the developers. Paradox Interactive staff have been brilliant with offering support/help for the game, it's just a shame they are acting as the middleman between the end user and the developers.Until the core game mechanics are fixed, I will not be recommending this to future buyers.EDIT: As of now it seems that the Developers cannot be bothered fixing the serious issues of the game and have asked people to stop asking for them to fix said issues, as stated on the Forum."

86,68.0,Recommended," January 8, 2016",5,"Refreshing city building game that touches on the roots of the original Sim City games. As a complete package I would rate this game over Sim City and it's expansion pack ""Cities of Tomorrow"". Bigger zones to build out on, basically these equal the size of Sim City regions. Better road management options, better public transport option (subways!), Day/Night cycle based budgeting, mods, great graphics, overall a more complicated but more rewarding game.Couple of things it falls short on would be budgeting, while you have more fine tuned options to adjust your finances, it lacks the ability that Sim City has where you can indivualy reduce/increase funding to say schools. In Cities Skylines if you adjust the budget for Education it affects all schools, so for example one school may need more funding because it overcrowed. By increasing the funding to education it increases all school funding nore matter the type. So while I may now have enough money to suuport the Elementary school, my high school is now over funded.Region play is missing from Cities: Skyline but makes up for it in the size of maps. Plus the avaliability of terraforming and making your own map!Industry is handled better in Sim City than Cities: Skylines hands down. While in Sim City specializing in certain industries (Oil, Ore, etc..) has a progression type mechanic too it, you dont start out with all the goodies. In Skylines you more or less lay down Industry tiles, district it to whatever you're trying to produce (farms for instance) and just kind of let it go. No real interaction with it like there is with Industry in Sim City.In my personal opinion it's still a vastly more fun game and with Steam Workshop support the possiblities are endless!"

145,296.3,Not Recommended, January 17,5,"I have burned countless hours building impressive cities and enjoying this game. Everything from wind and water movement to pollution and goods transportation is included in this game. Not only are you building a city, but you are managing the logistical need to move people and goods in and out of that city. You can adjust the growth of your city with districts and specialized industry/business areas. And your citizens will adjust their lives based on what is available. Many of the options are watered down or simplified, but the scale on which you can build these networks and grow is awesome.Compared to Sim City, this game is overwhelmingly better in almost every category. But for 2 reasons, I cannot recommend that a person spend the money for it.Reason 1: It's buggy as all hell. Don't even bother with that steam workshop. The moment you add in custom assets or mods, the game starts falling apart and @*$%ing all over itself. Re-loading saved games is like an olympic test of performance on any computer. Even without mods enabled, the game likes to crash and freeze constantly. After 3 years and numerous DLC, no patches have seemed to improve the stability of the game itself.Reason 2: It's bland. Don't get me wrong, the building can be fun, but after one map in the American theme, every other city is going to look the same. Sure, you can deal with snow, or you can have fun with the broad-reaching ""European"" theme. But Collosal Order has opted to focus on other areas, leaving the same buildings, the same streets, and the same look every game. The re-playability has gone down as there are nothing new to look at or enjoy, just the same factories and stores and the same suburbs.(To piggyback off of item 2, The problems hurled at you during the game are mild and not very creative. I mean great, you can be hit by an asteroid. What city in history has been devistated by a meteor or something like that lately? But why not have a bugetary crisis or recession? What about the financial crisis that led to the crime waves in NYC in the 1980s? There's no real-world hurdles to grapple with, just build your deep space radar and try to get people to ride a bus instead of cloging Aspen Street all hours of the day.)"

86,19.4,Recommended," March 17, 2015",5,"Cities Skyline is a great game if you like to build modern cities. The road system is incredibly well done. I like how they chose to link zones directly to roads. Everything feels neat and clean. It has in-game tools for creating your own maps and game assets. You can create, for instance, a custom power plant with your own model or build it out of pre-existing models and determine it's stats such as cost and power output. Best of all your creations can easily be posted to the steam workshop and the game is incredibly mod-friendly. I like almost everything about the game; in fact my only major complaint is that the game is too easy.It's virtually impossible to ""lose"" at cities skylines. Even if you play like a complete idiot, going bankrupt is very rare unless you want it to happen. You can just have insanely high tax rates and let people move in, get totally reamed, leave angrily only to come back later. You could be the worst mayor who ever lived and make millions with ease. With the exception of losing a valuable structure to a fire or something, there's virtually no consenquences to anything you do. Some might say it's not about winning or losing, aiming instead for effeciency, but there's a fine line between ""min-maxing"" (making your city as effective as you can) and having no challenge whatsoever.Sim City 3000, for instance, was much harder to get into the green; requiring you carefully plan your city or to plague it with casinos and toxic waste dumps (which were unique buildings you can only build when given the opprotunity to do so) in order to get ahead. Whenever you had enough money to build something big, it really mattered. You had to decide if you wanted a new hospital or some reinforcement to your educational system - and if you would have enough income to support your new object. Expanding your city size and adding more zones was also a very careful decision players made in Sim3K, because if you could not adequately support a new burst of population it could mean trouble. There were legitimate consequences to your actions - cranking up tax rates won't just make people leave, they will riot and start fires. Even with Skyline's ""hard"" mode which is tucked away as an optional mod you can turn on (right next to infinite money) the game feels way too simple at times.Ultimately if you just wanna mess around and build stuff, Skylines is obviously a massive upgrade to the original sim games - but it's kind of terrible as an actual game that imposes challenges and problems you have to overcome. With modding, though, I'm sure the community could find a way to make the game more difficult. The game has a good soundtrack (pretty sure I hear some references to older SimCity music in there, too), cozy aesthetics and enough variety to keep most players entertained for at least 20 to 30 hours. Definitely a good purchase for both people who like city builders and those who are new to the genre.Rating: B+PS: Death to chirper."

If you were wondering, my dogs are a labradoodle, and a wheaten terrior. Enough about my dogs! This is a very fun game, and I recommend it.My only complaint: If you start your town in a wrong way, you automatically lost.8.5/10.[One last thing: Make sure you have a powerful computer for this game because it takes up a lot of space!]"

I can't really tell that the graphics looks great, but it is good enough and fun to look at. Especially with the night time update.Water animation also a nice features within this game, flowing water looks great, though a bit sluggish at times.If you're trying to be realistic, you're going to get a let down from this game, cars drive in unrealistic manner, look at those high speed sharp turns. But if your main focus is only on its city building, you'll be surprised how good this is moreover with addtion of mods you can download from steam workshop, you could make your city looks like a real one.The gameplay is what you are going to expect from city building game, you get a plot of land, you build infrastructure, house, commercial and industrial zone, you then try to ugprade, try to increase the value of those properties. Then once you profit enough you can try to expand your land.One of the great feature of this game is that every person and vehicle has it own routes, you won't see people or cars suddenly disappearing, it's a very great feature, once you have finished building, you could just click any person or vehicle and let the camera follows their activity. (Doing this onto trains feels so asweome, especially when you've build awesome complex railroad system.Road building, you could try any road system you want to try, want to copy the road from your local neighborhood, or even large famous town like New York city, you could do it. Even create some roller coaster tycoon like roads.Another thing that's great within this game is its transportation simulation, there's just so much to choose, especially if you buy the DLC, from the base game you get, bus, subway/metro, railroad, airport and ships. With the DLC you'll get Taxi and then with the newest DLC; tramlines. You'll learn from your mistake on how hard it is to create the perfect transportation system for your crowded city.Monuments.

However, I'm capped at playing with a population ≤100,000 people because of performance related issues.

Especially with the night time update.Water animation also a nice features within this game, flowing water looks great, though a bit sluggish at times.If you're trying to be realistic, you're going to get a let down from this game, cars drive in unrealistic manner, look at those high speed sharp turns. But if your main focus is only on its city building, you'll be surprised how good this is moreover with addtion of mods you can download from steam workshop, you could make your city looks like a real one.The gameplay is what you are going to expect from city building game, you get a plot of land, you build infrastructure, house, commercial and industrial zone, you then try to ugprade, try to increase the value of those properties. Then once you profit enough you can try to expand your land.One of the great feature of this game is that every person and vehicle has it own routes, you won't see people or cars suddenly disappearing, it's a very great feature, once you have finished building, you could just click any person or vehicle and let the camera follows their activity. (Doing this onto trains feels so asweome, especially when you've build awesome complex railroad system.Road building, you could try any road system you want to try, want to copy the road from your local neighborhood, or even large famous town like New York city, you could do it. Even create some roller coaster tycoon like roads.Another thing that's great within this game is its transportation simulation, there's just so much to choose, especially if you buy the DLC, from the base game you get, bus, subway/metro, railroad, airport and ships. With the DLC you'll get Taxi and then with the newest DLC; tramlines. You'll learn from your mistake on how hard it is to create the perfect transportation system for your crowded city.Monuments. Gettin an achievement will give you access to special building, called monuments, most of them are tourist attraction building for your city."

If you played Simcity before, you will like this game (especially since the newest Simcity was/is a mess).Expansions and mods really help flesh out the experience and fix most of the game's vanilla shortcomings. Much like Civ 5."
97,12.7,Recommended," August 12, 2017",1,"It's the best city building game ever! Also the best sim i could find ever! It's a bit expensive but worth the money ;)The game is awesome, you can control traffic manage services to almost the full extent. I can spend hours in this game without being bored, tons of replayability. At a point, you might be busy handling the traffic and on the other side you just find out that you forgot to give a necessary service to a part of people.. That's the real fun and challenge about the game. Designing and managing your own city <3. It also has an asset editor so you can make and publish your content and also import somebody else's city for studying it and improving yours :P Overall, AMAZING GAME, WORTH BUYING!10/10"
290,50.0,Recommended, January 1,1,"This game is the best ""Sim City"" game I have played. Great looking and has lots of layers to micromanage and figure out just how to grow a cool looking city. Some of the dlc enhances the experience and there are mods to add even more to the game. The game is presently on sale and anyone interested should pick it up now !!!"

806,1.9,Recommended," December 25, 2017",1,"I'm a simple man, this game is not simple.I tried about 4 ""playthroughs"" and I would lose as soon as I'd start getting some buildings off the ground. Why do people even require money or water or electricity? What is this? 21st century.Needless to say, I completely sucked at this game and I literally have no idea how to play it.And yes. I literally went bankrupt, across 4 playthroughs in a bit over 30 minutes.Edit: Okay, I found out that you can play as awful as you wanna play and the game will be like, yo, you're going bankrupt, have 50k but we're disabling achievements."
31,113.7,Recommended, January 9,1,"Definitely an addicting game if you're into sims.This is more of a city builder than a simulator, but it's fun to build massive highways and create traffic jams for those poor civs to make through on their way to work.The mod base is incredible as well. Could easily recommend this to anyone."
98,146.0,Recommended," March 13, 2015",1,"No internet connection required to play. Area for building is huge, huge, huge. You can build wonderful organic cities without having to worry about space. Steam workshop integration from day one and it's filling up at the speed of light. Game works."

539,535.3,Recommended, February 10,1,"I've dropped over 500 hours into C:SL since its purchase. While I play it a bit less now in favor of a lot of hacking and slashing and looting all of the things, it's not a knock against the city builder in any way.It's the kind of game I can sit down with, play for a few hours, and enjoy dealing with the city building and the chaos that can come with it, whether it's a poorly planned interchange, a surprise flood in a scenario, or goodness knows what else.I was looking for a city builder after getting burned not once, but twice on CitiesXL and its ilk, and at that time, this game was new and had promise. I've lost entire weekends to crazy city builds, and I'm not sorry for that time lost."

14,225.9,Recommended, February 9,1,"The game makes hour fly by as you build that perfect downtown layout that FINALLY, doesn't have loads of traffic and is connected throughout your map. The game is way better with mods and i would recomend that new people definitly cheak the workshop out."
3,713.5,Recommended, February 10,1,"Absolutely outstanding! Would definitely reccomend over any other city building game, it is a pleasure to play and gives you unlimited controls over realistic-looking cities. It has an extended workshop with mods, assets, maps and themes (etc.) straight from the community. Has very good graphics. The 'traffic' could, however, be somehow improved as can cause a problem at times, though I think that the game is absolutely wonderful nevertheless."

61,34.4,Recommended, February 8,1,"a better game than simcity 2013. so many things can build and do, and the graphics arent the best but there are tons of modding community. really worth it. it also gets into discount many times. One of those few games that i am willing to buy DLC"
101,46.6,Recommended, February 19,1,"This is one of those games which falls under the ""easy to learn, difficult to master"" categories. I picked it up on sale, and during the first few hours it really did a good job of showing me the ropes. The mechanics, interface and design are all intuitive. Yes, with time you realize additional menus that make things even better, but the game is definitely easier to pick up on then some other simulators out there (I’m looking at you planet coaster). Visually, the game is very pleasing.Within a few hours my city had grown to a respectable size. Little did know what troubles were in store for me! one word.... TRAFFIC...... I made some poor design choices when placing my roads. Couple that with poor placement of industry, commercial zones too many high rise residential areas. ineffective public transport system and you have the ingredients for a disaster. Traffic became so bad that my services couldn’t get around to clearing out garbage, putting out fires, moving the dying, fighting crime and so on. People started to move out and the next milestone of my cities growth was out of reach (mile stones unlock additional tech for your city i.e. better power plants, new buildings, trains, airplanes, etc...). I went back to the drawing board, did some research on road design, interchanges and started to build a better city next time round.What makes this game even more fantastic is the wonderful community. Tons of videos and guides are out there to help you and give you new perspectives. Additionally, the modding community has developed some wonderful material for this game. Some of it is a must for when you play. For example, mods for additional bus designs or new car types, or different buildings. Or pre-created interchanges to save you time building them yourself. I advise you do some research into the best mods and utilize them to make your experience even better."
154,97.9,Recommended, February 19,1,"Cities: Skylines is a city builder in which the player assumes the role of a mayor in charge of building and managing an ever growing modern-age metropolis. Starting with nothing more than an empty plot of land the player is tasked with building a city that caters to their citizens’ needs.That includes a working road and public transportation network, space for housing, factories to work in and commercial districts for the citizens to spend their hard-earned cash in. Additionally, there are services like a working police force to keep the crime rate low, fire departments to lower the fire hazard and hospitals to take care of sick citizens.During the last phases of the game it is possible to unlock so called monuments – large buildings that have unique and very powerful properties and will spice up your city considerably.ProsAs someone who never played a city builder like this before, I was surprised how much I enjoyed my time with the game.Very relaxing and super addictive - perfectly hits the “once-i-get-this-residental-area-setup-i-can-hit-the-next-milestone-and-start-working-on-my-awesome-new-cargo-train-network-and-then-expand-into-the-bay-area-and-make-an-awesome-looking-tourism-sector-oh-no-it’s-3am-again”-nerve.Also: Trains are the best!"
53,36.1,Recommended," February 19, 2016",1,"This game is straight-up addicting. I was a little worried when I bought it, that it would one of those games where you get lost in the micro-management and numbers-crunching and if you don't keep every detail perfect, then everything goes to hell.But in fact, playing Cities: Skyline is straight-forward, stream-lined and actually pretty easy. You don't have to build individual buildings - just zone an area, and the buildings will sprout automatically. If your citizens are unhappy, it's easy to find out what's wrong. Dragging roads, water lines, and establishing zones has a very intuitive feel. There's a solid, steady pace to the game: you're not inundated with responsibilities, instead, they gradually accumulate as your population expands.The tutorial is sorely lacking, so for the first 30 minutes I was thoroughly confused - that was aggravating. But C:S shows you all the information you need to know with the overlays and information panels, so it's not difficult to find out what to do."
2,83.8,Recommended," February 19, 2016",1,"Cities: Skylines is, in lack of a better description, a super Sim City. Even in the game's community the inhabitants are referred to as ""cims"" (instead of ""sims"").When creating and growing cities, at first the challenge is about budgeting but soon the biggest challenge is about functionality - whether creating new neighbourhoods intelligently or micro-managing the ones that already exist. The ammount of micro-managing, especially traffic, is inversely proportional to the thought you put into creating new neighbourhoods.The game fools you into thinking ""hey, this is easy, i keep an eye on demands and create what they need and the city grows"" but then, when you notice, you have sick citizens because of pollution, burned down buildings because the fireman can't reach the fires, traffic jams that don't allow people to go to work or, even if they do, don't allow cargo trucks to keep the economy working, etc.One thing is for sure, after some hours playing this game, you will think about your own town's city planning whenever you go out and drive."

21,39.7,Recommended," February 19, 2016",1,"This is what a City Sim should be like. It has everything you need, plus a huge community of modders so if you miss something in the game, there's probably a mod for that. If you have Mayor in your belly, this is the game for you!"
233,93.9,Recommended," February 19, 2016",1,"It's a smashing game, it really is. You expect a certain level of frustration with games like this not behaving how you want them to, but Cities: Skylines seems virtually frustration-free, which is a splendid achievement.If there's a criticism to be had it's that it's a bit too easy - I find it quite hard to fail in any way and I doubt it's because I'm just great at it. As others have said it might benefit from disasters being added, both in the earthquake sense and economic crashes and the like.But, overall, a tremendous game."

24,170.0,Recommended," February 19, 2016",1,"Cities: Skylines is probably the new benchmark for City-Builder games. It has so much to give, and so much to love. Not only does it allow us to create our own maps, we get to share them and more with the Steam Workshop! All the possibilities of this game makes it comparably superior to SimCity (2013). If there was one City-Builder you would want to try first, it'd definitely have to be Cities: Skylines."

47,31.3,Recommended, February 6,1,"As you open this game you become very involved and even addicted to your city. The more your city grows the more is required from the player. As your city surpasses 100,000 people you realize you its 6am 2 days later and you havent moved from your desk. Long story short, this game ruined my life."

Well this game is for you... sort of. The quality of your pc will determine whether you can get the full potential out of this game... The base game is alright but gets old quick... the modding community however, makes this the best city building game ever. However, as I said before the quality of your computer will determine how many mods and user created assets you can use and even how much area you can unlock... This is a cpu intensive game if you wish to build large cities with multiple assets so just be warned... otherwise it is clear that CO did everything they could to deliver a city builder which city simulation fans wanted instead of what they as a company wanted (like maxis did with SC5) and it shows... If you have a good pc and dont mind using the community content this is the best city builder ever... Without it this game is ok but it will get old quick."
853,75.5,Recommended," May 29, 2015",1,"I honestly thought this was going to be a bad attempt to copy SimCity before I bought this game, but my friends and other reviews convinced me to try it regardless. I'm glad I did. It's a well thoughtout game and extremely addicting. I couldn't ask for much more from a city simulator (where's the disastors?).If you are SimCity fan or just curious about city simulators I highly recommend giving this a go.Also, it's mod friendly!Now if you excuse me, I have some traffic to monitor and optimize."
33,48.8,Recommended," March 14, 2015",1,"This is the city builder you've been waiting for, it's addictive, it's got a cool visual style, it's very detailed in its simulation (renameable EVERYTHING, create your own transit lines and have neighbourhood bylaws).

Until you realize you have been pumping♥♥♥♥♥♥into your cities water source and half your city is dead.However, I will say that cities skylines made me incredibly dissapointed when they started bringing out DLC, and for that matter expensive DLC. I bought the base game for about $21 on sale, and now I see I can buy a DLC that costs $19? It just doesn't make sense. There are some massive improvements that could be made in the base game that everybody just downloads mods for, the modding community for cities skylines is the thing making this game good. Not the developers who are investing their time into making useless expensive DLC."
129,17.9,Recommended," December 6, 2017",1,"Cities: Skylines is an amazing new take on the city-building genre. I played SimCity, and didn't like where EA took that series after Will Wright left Maxis. I was really hoping that the SimCity would capture that same look and feel of the best game in the series, SimCity 4, and while updating the old ways and making them better, but sadly, even with all the improvements in graphics and different gameplay elements, SimCity did not feel like a true successor. That's where Cities: Skylines shines.As soon as I started up the game and got to the main menu, I enjoyed what it had to offer. Cities: Skylines feels very new and unique in it's own way. It's doing it's own thing with city-building, and it doesn't feel like a ripoff. It's very easy to play and learn, and that's one thing I like about it. I can jump in my city at any time and start up where I left off with ease, and it runs pretty smoothly as well.Another thing I like about the developers is that they keep releasing content for the game, and I find their support of their game superb. I never have felt like I got that with EA's games. Even with Spore, there were a couple DLC packs and then that was that. No more support for another great game that could have been even better with further support from Maxis. The developers at Colossal Order Ltd. are very supportive and helpful when it comes to playing Cities: Skylines. I'm happy with the final product, and even happier that they choose to further support their game by releasing new expansions and updates to improve upon the base game, and finally, the fact that user-made content is appreciated and encouraged by the developers themselves. That is a huge plus in my eyes.I rate this game 5/5, 10/10, and 100/100. Very good work, Colossal Order Ltd.. Keep it up!"

46,123.7,Recommended, March 18,1,"The most satisfactory city simulator i ever played. There is a lot of pros, like the details of each citizen, vehicle, building, etc. The form of energy production impacts in the mayor's (yours) image. The happiness, health, fire security, crime fight, education, each of them shape the development of the city, and the traffic... AHHH the traffic! It's so problematic to solve all the problems, a huge real puzzle. If u are a thinking person, just go for it and buy this game. I don't have all the DLCs, so i ll comment my personal vision of the game. It's not perfect. Can be improved, like more traffic tools (probably present at the MASS TRANSIT DLC) like speed limit control, time of each crossing street (if i have a intense car flux in one way, can setup the semaphores ll be helpful).Well, sorry my rusty english, but I thought my review ll reach more players if it is in english.Thanks for the developers for this gift called Cities: Skylines!!"

I do really enjoy the transition of trying to build small city with those tiny roads until making a megalopolis (or is it? anyway, it's massive!) with tons of highways and intersections.NB: and everyone should be loving the view of your own city in panoramic angles :))Definitely recommend this game!"
15,282.5,Recommended," September 18, 2016",1,"Great game. Its better than Simcity in many ways. Dont compare this to Simcity. Simcity feels like an arcade after playing this gem of a simulator. Its everything you wanted simcity to ever be, but has failed to deliver time and again. Alot more depth on your city designs, and actually watch your city grow into a huge Metropolitan. The only thing I do not like is the fact that you cannot go in to more depth with charts and scales and see a history of your economies well being. But dont let that deter you from trying this out. I got it on sale awhile back for 10 bucks, next time you should too, if you like city sims, and this is one of the best I must say."
571,23.6,Recommended," April 7, 2015",1,"They got right everything that simcity got wrong. The game works well, has a vibrant modding community, and is enjoyable. Some of the in-game systems can be a little iffy (e.g. traffic management) but otherwise thoroughly entertaining."
196,172.0,Recommended," March 17, 2015",1,"In Cities: Skylines construct a city that becomes so massive you are not sure when you will stop building it! That's right, you can expand out by purchasing plots of land around your city. No not with real world money, but with in game currency. It is a sad thing when that has to be said because of today's gaming market being riddled with micro transactions.When placing roads, construction tiles (this is what I am going to call them) appear beside them. This allows the player to create zones for building. The zones are residential (low or high density), commercial (Low or High), industrial and office Zones . What the city needs is broken down in to 3 colors, green for residential, blue for commercial and orange for industry. The higher the need the more the bar will rise to the top. The electric grid is maintained by having buildings semi close to one another, if this is not possible the player can close the gap with power lines. To maintain the city water pipes, pumping stations and water drain pipes need to be put into place.One thing to either remember or adjust is, if you want to take advantage of natural resources in the area (farm land, oil, ore etc) make sure to create a district and assign the correct resource for the area. If you do not the game will just create a generic industry on top of the resources you want to use. In most cases this will ruin said resources.Buildings will upgrade themselves depending on the influences in the area. The maximum level varies from building type. Placed structures have no levels to gain. They merely influence the zones around them. So placing a hospital will increase the happiness in a certain region, while placing a stadium will increase the happiness in a certain area outer area of influence, but residential zones to close will suffer from noise pollution.The game is not without its flaws. For more details click the video below!If you are a fan of city builder games and want to get the confined feelings that simcity left you with, I would have to encourage looking at this title."

2,230.7,Recommended," September 30, 2015",1,"If you like realistic city builders, this game is just fit your needs. This game has a huge list of things that I really compared from the other city builders such as SimCity and Cities XL series. As the devs said that this game supposed to be like managing a real city.-Huge Maps-Insane Modding Community-Devs will listen and care.-Realistic Water/Sewer System-Good Traffic and Transportaton ManagementSince After Dark was added in that they added in a day/night cycle. The game is missing a few things such as a weather/season system, disasters like hurricanes, tornados, earthquakes, massive snowstorm. I think the would improve some stuff but not going to detail it here.Thumbs up to both Paradox and Colossal Order for making this very great game that I really adore playing much."

Last time I played City builder, it was SimCity 2000 on Windows 98. I was probably 8 years old.Anyway... Even though there's many paid DLC, Vanilla game itself has so much into it, you can spend hours and hours only with it. This game might be hard first because there's so many things to note like noise pollution, pollution, traffic, land value etc.But when you succeed with your city and it prospers you feel sense of pride and accomplishment!"

I will though.Like a lot of reviews I've read I re-started the game many times as i messed up with roads mainly and ran out of money. My current game I got into debt at the start but was helped out with a £30000 giveaway and pulled it around. After a little tinkering I finally got the hang of things and i now have a city with a 30000 population.I've managed to publish my first ever workshop items through this. It makes it so easy to do, if I was an artist i may have even considered doing my own art/graphics but alas I'm not. The one issue with workshop content, they disable Achievements. While I can understand this for mods why do it for assets(plots/houses etc.)? I know you can set the parameter's of a lot(Entertainment/water use/Elec use etc.) which i am guessing is the main reason but is there not a way around that somehow?There are a few thing's i would like to see added/tweaked but overall its one hell of a game. I would recomend this game big style to anyone who likes simcity and city building games in general. Keep up the good work devs and i'll look forward to more polish/tweaks/updates & expansions/dlc."
32,268.6,Recommended," July 4, 2017",1,"I think Cities Skylines is one of the best games I have ever played, is challenging and is always improving itself, gives you an idea of what people really does when planning streets, parks and stuff like that, having in mind the traffic that will generate. AI for this game is awesome.I have the based game and the After Dark DLC, which I think is the basic stuff you want to start with. Nevertheless the rest of the DLC´s they seem to be a really good addition to the game.You cannot go wrong with this Game if you like the type of building games."

61,9.2,Recommended, January 27,1,"I am and have always been a huge fan of simulation games. This game by far is the best SimCity game i have ever played - the interface of building is so much better as far as placement of roads, optional elevation - types of avenues, single lane and highways goes. They have come a along way since the first SimCity. the addition of districts is also super cool - now you can have a massive industrial area in the center of your city without creating a deadly amount of population. The addition of tourism options is also handy. I also really like the way they revamped the public transit structure - it is now way more effective and alot easier to use.I could go on and on about this game. Overall i give it a 11/10.absolutely love it."
129,46.9,Recommended," March 17, 2015",1,"Overview: A simcity killer that does everything right, plain and simple.Pros:-Beautifully simple and easy to learn interface. Took me about 5 minutes to figure out where everything was.-The ""chirp"" system of notifications is a really good way of bringing a realistic form of alerts into the game.-Tutorial is very helpful but not in the way if you already know what to do.-Map editor, asset editor, editor editor...-Endless community assets, mods, and addons-Beautiful looking and not hard to run on modern laptops.-There is an immense amount of depth to the game and it is simplified just enough to make it so youre always doing something, but youre never confused. It is always clear what you need to do, how to do it, and why.-You can rename anything and anyone, to anything you want.Cons:-A couple of bugs (that already have community fixes)-Roads can be a bit frustrating at time. However, updates are already rolling out concerning updating / downgrading them.-Intersections and redoing roadways when it becomes a high traffic area basically destroys any local economy based on those roadways. Wish there was a more efficent way of upgrading intersections themselves, rather than just having them prebuilt.Final verdict:If you've been looking for a city simulator that is fun, but simcity just didnt do it for you, then this game is for you.9/10"

The mod support is amazing - if for some reason the developers wouldn't add something, a modder can and will! Even the base game is plenty to work with for quite a while, so there's not even a need to rush into mods or other custom content. But it's there when you want it!The traffic can be goofy at times, but it's got charm, and I'm sure there will be improvements over time.

That's how I explained this game to all my friends. I loved Simcity 4, not so much the simplistic mess that was Simcity (2013). I love this game because it is more SC4 than Simcity (2013), and it is utterly gorgeous to boot.This game has all the micromangment I loved in SC4, and then some, coupled to an utterly beautiful engine that is not just gorgeous to look at, but it does what it needs to do. This game has a relatively well-working AI that actually makes transportation work. I am utterly in love with the planned routes.I really felt like my cities were alive, and what more, they were my cities. I could name my districts, my transport lines, some facilities, etc. The policies made tweaking everything just a joy. And when I am done tweaking an area, I can watch the city react almost instaneously. I can see the changes at work. For example, I can zoom in real close and see the impact of on pedestrian traffic of that new footpath I added. I can also sit back, and just cruise over my city and watch it just live.If you want a City builder that is like SimCity 4, except newer, this game is most definitely a heavy contender."

309,176.7,Recommended," November 22, 2017",1,"Cities Skylines is the game Sim City 5 should have been.Build a sprawling utopian metropolis built upon clean energy and renewable policies, or harvest the land for raw resources and build an industrial dystopia.Cities Skylines has recieved numerious DLC updates in which many of the gameplay improvements have been made availible to owners of the base game free of charge.This is the City management Sim you've wanted since Sim City 2000."
285,114.5,Recommended," August 13, 2015",1,"Cities: Skylines is the best city building game that I have played to date. Unlike any other that I have seen, the focus of Skylines is not on fine budget management, or clever zoning, but on traffic management. After your city gets on its feet and people start pouring in, you will spend the rest of the game designing elegant solutions to the gridlock that will plague your city- and slapdash fixes when that doesn't work. Money is rarely a problem, unless you screw up something major and leave everyone without power, or water, or over-educate all your cities and run out of workers, but this rarely happens. Every single citizen in your city has a home, and a job, and they need to be able to get from one to the other easily- no mean feat. When imports and exports are thrown into the mix, snarling traffic jams and clogged up roads further than the eye can see are inevitable.TL;DR This is one of my favourite games, it's definitely worth the full price of 30USD and is good for endless fun. I'm definitely putting a lot more hours into it."
103,141.1,Recommended," April 12, 2015",1,"I played almost every city building game you can imagine: each and every SimCity game (even SimCity Social and Societies, yuck), the Anno series aka Dawn of Discovery, Cities XL, Stronghold, Cities in Motion, Tropico, and even the really old stuff like Caesar or Pharaoh.You can imagine that I love these types of games!And let me tell you this - Cities: Skylines is easily the best city simulator in over 10 years, trust me. The base simulation and game polish is very solid, but with easy and well integrated mod support, the game is nothing short of phenomenal.And it's only 30 bucks. And was made by 13 people. Could someone pinch me?"

The workshop adds a ton more functionality and content and is the main reason I still play this game.A few essentials mods would be 81 tiles, extra landscaping tools, network extentions, surface painter & props and search box. Most importantly of all, the mod ""Move it!"" allows you to use keyboard controls to move already existing roads and buildings inch by inch. If you are going to downlaod alot of custom assets - Id highly recommend getting ""Loading screen mod"" to see the progress on loading since with a heavy mod loadout, it can feel like the loading screen isnt doing nothing stock."

There are many ways to play this game and with the different DLC's there is a lot of variety available. I do think the dlc's are a bit overpriced when just released but buying them right away or waiting on sales is totally up to you.But, I am gonna add this even though it has nothing to do with the vanilla game; the steam workshop community is amazing but that in combination with the DLC's is eating on your performance. Just keep that in mind when you want to buy this game.I wish the traffic/ pathfinding of AI would be different/ better or more realistic but there are ways to work around it, or work with. In the end, this game is fantastic and has a lot to offer. If you like building/ simulation games and such and you don't have Cities: Skylines in your library than shame on you! I am sure I will have a lot more hours of fun playing this game than I already have so far."
17,239.4,Recommended," October 27, 2017",1,"This game is amazing. It has all the amazing aspects you would exect in a city building game, plus more. This game has everything that SimCity didn't. It's customizable roads and asset syestems make for very complex road systems, and very dense housing developments. The modding community is also gargantuant, with anything you could think of being in the workshop. However, I have two complaints about this game. The graphics and standard buildings are kinda ugly, compared to SimCity's gorgeous ones. I suppose they would look ok turned up to maximum, but you have to have a computer that is $1700+ for the game to not overload itself and crash. It's lag gets extreame whenever you get a town with over 10,000 people. This has limited me to only one computer I can access this on. So overall this game is great, BUT DONT BUY IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A $900+ COMPUTER."
21,516.8,Recommended," December 29, 2016",1,"Cities: Skylines is an improvement on the genre. If you are making the jump from Simcity 4 to Cities: Skylines, then you will be shocked by how much the road building; traffic simulation; and zoning have improved. Gone are the days of those rigid grid streets with cars being generated as you simply move the camera around. Gone are the days where plots have to be in a grid. You are free to build as you please, even weird shapes that look really ugly! Cars are persistent and try to reach fixed destinations that their drivers have (work, shopping, etc). You'll definitely never go back to Simcity 4 again, except maybe to blow up your cities."

You can be a detailer who makes cities by placing each bush one at a time, or just play the base game! The DLCs are not required at all due to the sheer number of addons for the game.

45,187.9,Recommended," November 28, 2016",1,There are some games that are completely addicting and force me to play for just another five minutes (which turns into hours). Cities: Skylines is one of those games. This game does what many city builders cannot. It has the feel of the Sim City series with just a few problems:-Traffic (4 and 6 lane roads are not helpful in most cases)-Not enough people per skyscraper building if you want realism. It's incredibly difficult (potentially impossible) to reach millions of people in your city-Not multiplayer and unable to attach your own cities together to create a bigger metropolis with more traffic issues (that was something that Sim City 4 still does well for singleplayer)Still the majority of the game is amazing fun with challenges to unlock important items for moving forward. I have no idea how many cities I have gone through and it still doesn't get old. It's a must have for anyone who enjoys a simulator.
25,398.5,Recommended, February 19,1,"An excellent city building sim to pick up where SimCity utterly failed. Excellent gameplay and beautiful assets make for a wonderful experience and its so easy to sink hours into this game and not even realize it. Definitely epitomizes the ""just one more thing"" addictive gameplay that keeps players engaged. There are some bugs in the game however and it needs to be said that traffic AI leaves ALOT to be desired and alot of time can be spent just working around the congestion caused by idiotic cars who only use one lane of a three lane road for five miles straight. Also the lack of multi track subway systems without a mod is a huge oversight. Mod are plentiful and theres literally over a hundred thousand different things in the workshop to suit any city situation. DLCs are getting a bit expensive for the amount of content they contain but the small size of the studio and the obvious love and effort they put into the base game make them an easy pill to swallow. Cities Skylines is all you want in a city building sim, amazing gameplay, great community support, and the ability to realize your craziest city dreams.... HIGHLY RECCOMMENDED"
171,11.5,Recommended," June 13, 2015",1,"This game perfectly scratches the itch that SIm City hasn't scratched since Sim City 4.

This game by far is the best SimCity game i have ever played - the interface of building is so much better as far as placement of roads, optional elevation - types of avenues, single lane and highways goes. They have come a along way since the first SimCity. the addition of districts is also super cool - now you can have a massive industrial area in the center of your city without creating a deadly amount of population. The addition of tourism options is also handy. I also really like the way they revamped the public transit structure - it is now way more effective and alot easier to use.I could go on and on about this game. Overall i give it a 11/10.absolutely love it."

The developer is constantly updating it with new content and bug fixes which is great to see. Also, there are some great places where CS players can meet, discuss and share content/tips (Facebook groups, fan websites etc).I have since purchased both of the two updates which gives the game even more depth and options and I'm looking forward to see what comes next.

It is always clear what you need to do, how to do it, and why.-You can rename anything and anyone, to anything you want.Cons:-A couple of bugs (that already have community fixes)-Roads can be a bit frustrating at time. However, updates are already rolling out concerning updating / downgrading them.-Intersections and redoing roadways when it becomes a high traffic area basically destroys any local economy based on those roadways.

306,199.9,Recommended," November 15, 2016",1,"To me, Cities: Skylines is the true successor to SimCity 4, boasting much larger maps than SimCity 2013, better mods, and more interesting gameplay. Get at least the After Dark expansion pack with it (your city becomes absolutely beautiful at night), and if you're like me you'll soon spend a good 40 hours on tinkering with highway systems alone."
49,127.7,Recommended, January 17,1,"Love this game but there are a few SLIGHT flaws, I'll post the positives first;-Great, clean graphics. Nicer than the new sim city-Great variety of buildings, more than sim city-Smooth framerate(most of the time)-MASSIVE maps, I've never fully filled one out-Good hub menuBUT, the only bad thing I will say is sometimes there's a lack of explination for things, like when I have 'not enough goods to sell' I'd like the game to tell me a brief summary on how I would fix that. I don't need my hand held but a brief summary would've been great.That's the only bad thing I have to say, buy this game. You have more freedom than with sim city/."
122,61.5,Recommended, January 18,1,"This isn't a game I sound days upon days playing, but this is a game that no matter when you pick it up or how much time you have put into it, it still feels like a new city building experience. The base game comes with enough material that you wont even look at the DLC until you've put about 50 hours in, and they rejuvenate the game playing experience everytime. I was worried about the controls being hard to learn since my only previous experience with city builders was tropico and the Sim City franchise, but the game gives you freedom without throwing you to the wolves. When you first start, you have basic utilities, and you gain new amnenities as you progress in your city building, which allows you a chance to gain familiarity with the controls without the high risk pressure. Cities Skylines is a relaxing, complex, creative game well worth the price tag. 10/10 would recommend"
64,242.3,Recommended, January 18,1,"I have 218 hours on this game by the time of this review. The game is super addicting. I keep rebuilding the same city over and over again and everytime I set off to fully play a whole map I usually end up playing a quarter of a map before starting again and cannot for the life of me quit. It is an excellent game. Despite never actually ""completing"" a city I am always satisfied. I turn off all sound in the game and put on a podcast and that is how I spend my time on this game. I LOVE IT!"
65,50.5,Recommended, January 18,1,"I waited for this game to go on sale, scooped it up, and let it sit for a while. That was a a mistake! It's a soothing, creative, and fun way to pass the time. With two kids under the age of two in the house, I just don't have time for epic gameplay. This I can play for ten minute stretches and still feel satisfied at the end of the ten minutes. I have also sat down to play after the kids have gone to bed, only to eventually realize hours had gone by while I lost myself in crafting a city."

71,35.7,Recommended," February 11, 2017",1,"So after trying this game on hard mode without any mods it is way more challenging. So challenging no one moves into your city. After reinstalling the game people started moving in. I have spent hours building my city...I think I will spend hours more.Old ReviewDon't get me wrong...I love this game. It is just too easy. Without any sort of tutorials or trying to make an extremely efficient city I was able to get to 80k residents in 6 hours of gameplay. I will continue to play the game but being able to unlock everything in so little time is quite a bit of a turn off for me. Still a great game. If it is signifigantly harder with the hard mode on I will try that, but otherwise it seems like my review is going to have to be negative."

50,28.1,Recommended," December 6, 2015",1,"Fun, simply and addictive. Skylines has done what the simcities have been failing to do for the last few outings: it's managed to be super fun. Building a city is easy to learn but difficult to master and will always keep you on your toes. The game does a good job of spacing out tasks and demands until you can handle them and never overwhelms you. Your fledgling city will have a host of differnt things you can build, differnt paths you can take and differnt policies you can implement. Well worth every penny. I got it on sale and it feels even sweet. Totally reccomended."

234,185.3,Recommended," August 7, 2015",1,This game is amazing. ive payed only a mere 60 hours of it but it is 50 times better than simcity 2013. i love the milestone system and the maps are by far large enough for your needs. if i could say soming bad though i would have to say its the fact that when something is wrong you have to be quite eagle eyed to notice as it doesnt totify you very well.also if you build areas all at once then you will have massive death waves.also it is very good because of its connection with the community with its endless mods and building assets on the workshop.PLUS ITS ONLY £30tHIS GAME IS DEFINETLY WORTH IT.
3,77.6,Recommended," August 23, 2017",1,"Nice fun game, I bought it approxiamately 1 month ago during summer sale (only €7,50). I like the game very much, you have plenty of options. But they have to fix a few bugs like the death-wave bug and traffic is most of the time only driving in one lane on a 4lane road. The only thing is that dlc is expansive and you'll get not very much from it. They have to make them cheaper."

95,616.3,Not Recommended," June 29, 2016",1,"Changed my review from positive to negative because of the huge influx of DLC that came into the game in the past couple of years.It's basically become what Paradox does to most if not all their published games. This game has less of that issue because they ""attempt"" to cushion it with Free content with every major DLC update. However there are some key mechanics or issues that have risen because I haven't bought any of the DLC.One glarring issue I've come across since the After Dark DLC Update release is my Police Station's prison cells are becoming over crowded with prisoners! And I can't deal with my 60+ extra prisoners just ""floating around somewhere??"" just because I haven't bought the After Dark DLC so I can build Prisons tohouse them... If you're going to force me with this issue why wouldn't you provide prisons as the Free Update..?Another good example of the greedy business practices that publishers push onto the developers just to boost their profit and stocks... The only thing Publishers are good for is the funding and marketing, and they don't always even get that right...Unfortunately this is one of the best City Builders out there...Second place if not still the best is Sim City 4, only thing holding back SC4 from easily being top is it's age... SC4 had the charm/personality, fairly well built ecconomic system, multiple cities in one region.My Dream City Builder would be in my eyes, quite unsurprisingly: Cities Skylines and Sim City 4 crossed together.If Maxis (developers of SC4) had their own capital to dedicate their own modern city builder, and the full time neccesary to build the game they want. Maybe even have Colosal Order work alongside them in developing the game.Both Dev companies have a great idea of what a city builder is like but they both had a few things missing where the other company could fill in the gap.But.. Tis only but a dream that will most likely never come to fruition..Hopefully in the near future a true predecessor city builder will come out and blow these games out of the water....And let's just pretend that Sim City 2013 doesn't exist."

My favorite part is naming my districts of my city after nicknames that my dogs were called. For example, Thickburger City, Hubsford Town, Whoodlevile. If you were wondering, my dogs are a labradoodle, and a wheaten terrior. Enough about my dogs! This is a very fun game, and I recommend it.My only complaint: If you start your town in a wrong way, you automatically lost.8.5/10.[One last thing: Make sure you have a powerful computer for this game because it takes up a lot of space!]"

330,52.8,Recommended," November 23, 2017",1,"A game about planning a city from foundation and taking care of it, and like every city, has all the problems that come with the growth of it, it´s better then the new Simcity, and as fun as the older Simcity titles (mainly 3000 and 2000), but to complement the game, is a MUST BUY the Mass Transit,Natural Disasters and Green Cities DLCs."
108,95.0,Recommended," April 15, 2015",1,"This is the first game I've ever reviewed on Steam. One of the first games I ever played was SimCity on MacOS 7 way back in the early 90's. I'm 30 years old. That may give you some perspective. SimCity2000 was the game that introduced gaming to my family, brother or sister, mother or father, along with Wolfenstein and Carmegeddon (weird, right?). Later on, my Dad and I played a bit of SimCity3000. I played a lot of SimCity4, including in the past year. There is a little bit of tradition here. Buy this game.That being said, there are some depth issues. While the game works intuitively, as you would imagine a city would, it doesn't have the depth of SimCity4 or SimCity2000. I won''t comment on SimCity3000 because I never played it to a significant extent. However, I believe the [already stated] intentions of the developer and the immediately incredible mod scene will ultimately make up for the lack of depth.That shouldn't affect your purchasing decision. This game is accessible and intuitive. Cities work exactly as expected. There are no interface or stability issues. Anyone who has an interest in the general (and I mean general) concept of villages/cities/towns will enjoy this game, from people interested in design to people interested in hardcore strategy games. Again, buy it."
601,938.6,Recommended," March 18, 2016",1,"After the recent SimCity turned out to be a massive flop, and Cities XXL being...well Cities XL reskinned, the city building genre pretty much looked dead and would probably share the fate of Maxis Studios.Then came Cities: Skylines.I enjoy Cities: Skylines because it's everything I ever wanted in a city builder, unrestrained building, and a virtual populace that actually interacts with the city you built. What that means is unlike Cities XL/XXL the cars and people aren't some visual, your people travel around the city to their jobs, go to places to relax, so on, and need to deal with the issues in between, like traffic.As for unrestrained building, with a bit of button presing and switch flipping you can tailor the game to however you want to play it. Even mod it if its not there already, Cities: Skylines does have a big modding scene.Now in game, you can set up your roads, bridges, tunnels, in anyway you want, make it crazy looking to fix traffic, or just see what you can do for fun, set up building next to it, you got low/high residental, low/high commercial, industrial, a good amount of city planning is involved.You can plan for tourism, traffic fluidity, making everyone happy, typical mainstays of the city builder, long story short, Cities: Skylines is by far the best city builder to have come out recently, I fully recommend it and its expansions."
81,97.6,Recommended," April 15, 2015",1,"Guaranteed that after playing you'll go outside, look at your city/town's infrastructure, and will relate it somehow to your experience in Cities: Skylines. You'll never look at roads the same again. SIMPLY. AWESOME."

The complexity of the game and the endless possibilities to build your city are astounding. And to top it all of: Steam Workshop! If you can think of something that's not in the game there's a good chance someone already created it in the Workshop.From grand city planning to local management of your bus lines, this game has it all.

It's customizable roads and asset syestems make for very complex road systems, and very dense housing developments. The modding community is also gargantuant, with anything you could think of being in the workshop. However, I have two complaints about this game. The graphics and standard buildings are kinda ugly, compared to SimCity's gorgeous ones. I suppose they would look ok turned up to maximum, but you have to have a computer that is $1700+ for the game to not overload itself and crash. It's lag gets extreame whenever you get a town with over 10,000 people. This has limited me to only one computer I can access this on. So overall this game is great, BUT DONT BUY IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A $900+ COMPUTER."

You can be a detailer who makes cities by placing each bush one at a time, or just play the base game! The DLCs are not required at all due to the sheer number of addons for the game. If you pick it up during one of the sales it is a steal!Tl:DR = BUY IT!"
67,42.9,Recommended," November 25, 2017",1,"The game is fun and certainly complex, and by using mods you can custiomize the gameplay to suit your style. You can play it as a sim-game or with a more casual approach.It has its flaws though: traffic management could certainly be improved, and once you reach a certain point the game kinda stalls because there is not much more to do. If you enjoy planning and designing you will enjoy how the game plays, but there are no objectives to complete, neither missions or scenarios.A lot of new content has been added with updates and DLCs, and the game seems to have at least a few years of support.I strongly recommend it if you like city building and relaxing for a while."
311,158.8,Recommended," November 23, 2016",1,"I used to adore the city builder and similar games of the past. So many hours of Sim City, Settlers, Colonization (okay, maybe not so much that one). To be honest I got completely tired of each iteration being pretty much 90% the same game witha just a few twists and better graphics.Then came Cities: Skylines. I absolutely adore everything about this game; even the 'bugs'. Which aren't even really bugs, just hilarious little happenings of the people and animals within my cities.What makes this game so great? The community. So many wonderful mods, the fantastic support of the dev team (Long live TotalyMoo!), and a game where you can get completely lost in the tiniest little details without feeling pressured by the game nagging you...

181,112.9,Recommended," March 15, 2015",1,"This is the game SimCity should have been.I got a small twinge of anxiety when I saw that the plot of land you start with was just as small as it is in said SimCity, but then I played the game a bit and realized you can actually expand the area later on by buying land, and your first land upgrade comes early on. The game makes your goals and milestones very clear. There are no conflicting messages, and the mechanics of the game are well explained. Especially nice is the ""relocate building"" button, so if you make a huge mistake, or just change your mind down the line, you aren't stuck bulldozing something ridiculously expensive. Even better, the price of the game itself is extremely fair.Fans of City Simulators will love it. While SimCity was full of all sorts of little things that wore away at your patience, Cities: Skylines has all sorts of little things that endear you to it and immerse you. Couldn't recommend it more."

One of the best things about the game is the obvious respect for the player. There is a full editor mode that allows players to create maps contents and MODs. Yup, that's right!

251,3.4,Recommended," October 3, 2015",1,"Everything in Cities: Skylines is great and works great! BUT, it REALLY Needs a lot more village / small town assets - not everybody loves major urban metro. A ski resport / log cabin / mountain town expansion is needed. Not all the world is flat. Coal mining town assets, more rural assets in general. MOST of planet Earth is sparse, rural community areas. Also, the addition of lots of Sci-Fi assets would be great - future town stuff, Caprica City stuff, Firefly, Star Trek, Star Wars, anything / any franchise. Also wasteland, capital wasteland, new vegas, fallout assets, and of course Skyrim maps and villages. Cities: Towns and Villages - with horse and buggy traffic, Amish expansion pack, camels and bicycles, overall - a great game, I just wish it had more variety of era / time frame... and of course after building a horse drawn buggy village, drop a Blue Box in a small corner, with a man and a lady that wander around that area..."
61,8.5,Recommended," October 27, 2017",1,"This always looked like an interesting game to me ever since it was released. I ended up purchasing the game and so far has been a very good time waster. Very addicting. The game has such a large amount of content, this includes workshop content to DLC. This ensures many hours of gameplay with a different experience each time you play. People always make the complaint, The DLC content is too expensive. I agree with this, however the amount of content in the base game + steamworkshop is more than enough to cater for anyone wanting a city builder simulator.Pros-Mods and Workshop content add many hours of unique gameplay-A large range of content in the vanilla game-UI and mechanics are in depth but user friendly.Cons- DLC is expenisve however the devs have done alot of work on the improvement of this game, therefore support to them is the least we can do to continue the development of the game!"

You can build your city to be a megatropolis, but still being able to focus on the tiniest of details.The amount of detail, such as being albe to track people, then being able to see where they live, where they work, and where they are going, just goes to show the amount of effort and brilliance put into this game.The level editors are fantastic. You have all the freedom in the world (although you still have to stay within guidelines).The modding community is vast and creative, there's a mod for everything.The only critique is the A.I.They are incredibly stupid.The traffic is god awful at an intersection because the A.I. can't seem to figure out that there is an extra lane, free.The only problem I'm having with my city is that I build faster than the city can keep up. I build an entire district, but since they have all they need, I have to wait for them to populate the area.And that's it! Those are only real problems I have.I seriously reccomend this.p.s. Try drowning your city in sewage, its really fun.54678907654367890-9876543678908765467890oplkjhyojkmyl;'uj#poidgrtjhp;j 4k';kl;;'p[#]#[][]][[# Out of 10 - IGN"
171,87.8,Recommended," March 10, 2015",1,"I'm going to edit my review since I don't think my previous one was that good.In Cities: Skylines, you can build cities. It's pretty realistic: you have to deal with traffic issues and what not, you have to build fire stations so your buildings don't burn down, you have to build cemeteries and crematoriums, etc.Overall, the game is very good, but what makes it even better is the Steam Workshop support. Without mods, I wouldn't have gotten the 67 hours I have logged on it as of time of writing. There's mods for basically everything. You can install mods so you'll have lots more of building varieties, you can add landmarks to your city, you can have a gigantic statue of a hamster if you want, there's mods to change the color of your roads or even Americanize them if you want.. As of recently, you can even mod VEHICLES: I can now see DeLoreans driving my city.And you can install a mod... with one click. You don't need any dragging & dropping folders, etc. like for other games like GTA IV.The developers are very great as well. They listen to their community and they are very active.This game was very well worth it in my opinion."

129,17.9,Recommended," December 6, 2017",1,"Cities: Skylines is an amazing new take on the city-building genre. I played SimCity, and didn't like where EA took that series after Will Wright left Maxis. I was really hoping that the SimCity would capture that same look and feel of the best game in the series, SimCity 4, and while updating the old ways and making them better, but sadly, even with all the improvements in graphics and different gameplay elements, SimCity did not feel like a true successor. That's where Cities: Skylines shines.As soon as I started up the game and got to the main menu, I enjoyed what it had to offer. Cities: Skylines feels very new and unique in it's own way. It's doing it's own thing with city-building, and it doesn't feel like a ripoff. It's very easy to play and learn, and that's one thing I like about it. I can jump in my city at any time and start up where I left off with ease, and it runs pretty smoothly as well.Another thing I like about the developers is that they keep releasing content for the game, and I find their support of their game superb. I never have felt like I got that with EA's games. Even with Spore, there were a couple DLC packs and then that was that. No more support for another great game that could have been even better with further support from Maxis. The developers at Colossal Order Ltd. are very supportive and helpful when it comes to playing Cities: Skylines. I'm happy with the final product, and even happier that they choose to further support their game by releasing new expansions and updates to improve upon the base game, and finally, the fact that user-made content is appreciated and encouraged by the developers themselves. That is a huge plus in my eyes.I rate this game 5/5, 10/10, and 100/100. Very good work, Colossal Order Ltd.. Keep it up!"

Building a city is easy to learn but difficult to master and will always keep you on your toes. The game does a good job of spacing out tasks and demands until you can handle them and never overwhelms you. Your fledgling city will have a host of differnt things you can build, differnt paths you can take and differnt policies you can implement. Well worth every penny. I got it on sale and it feels even sweet. Totally reccomended."

63,1.4,Recommended," October 12, 2015",1,"""Cities: Skylines"" is a game about building and managing a player created city/town/village/megapolis/etc. . It's a complete sandbox with great support from the Steam Workshop. The community creations only give even more detail to the already great game.It also features a map making tool/mode, that invites a large portion of players to add and share their creations on the workshop.There are minor gripes I, personally, have, such as the ability to disable traffic lights or improve the driver AI, for example. But wait, the unlimited support from the modding community HAS made it possible!So, in the end, I rate this game with a 9/10, the only major problem being the simplistic AI, that can ruin a trully great city, if for some reason your mods suddenly stop existing."
71,50.5,Recommended," October 12, 2015",1,"This game was the answer to my questions. Long after SimCity 4 has fallen by the wayside and it's processing limitations become glaring, this game rose to save my sanity.Many people will claim this is more of a sandbox rather than a difficult city building game; while that may be true, I think it is in fact plenty difficult. Most, if not all of your time will be probably be spent managing that godawful traffic. Learn the ways of the roundabout and the one-way street, and those problems can be conquered. Intersections are evil.Pros:+Large play area+Realistic graphics+Realistic simulations+Runs relatively well on older systems (see below)+Allows nearly-infinte city customization+Hydro dams!+Tons of mods to fix many game problems+Allows you to create your own vehicle/building assetsCons:-Dumb traffic AI-Pollution is too friendly-Street planning can be a nightmare due to lack of advanced tools-Eats RAM like there's no tomorrowIf you're a micromanaging SOB who hates drag-and-drop automatic games and wants to create graceful curving traffic systems, this is for you.

41,153.9,Recommended," March 17, 2015",1,"Built city, poisened everyone with their own poopsWould buy again.Great game and for me a hassle free launch. Really enjoying having a city builder that lets you build a city instead of just a corner of one. Some niggle AI problems but I am sure they will be patched and they are not at all game breaking.Best part, the game is likely to be well supported by the devs with updates and the game is open to modding by the community ensuring plenty of variety, items, buildings and fun.Highly recommended."
193,30.9,Recommended," April 19, 2015",1,"If you liked Sim City 4 then this is the game for you. SimCity was a let down for me, small city and very little room to expand in the game. This is the best city sim I have played in a long time. You can expand your city as your population There are still a few problems that I find like how they all seem to use 1 lane even though other lanes are free to use. Overall if you are in the market for a city simulation game I would only consider this one."
64,"1,329.4",Recommended," May 3, 2017",1,"As my playtime suggests, I do enjoy this game as I have spent countless hours on it - At first I was interested in effeciently handling the sims but now I spend half if not most of the time modifing aesthetics instead of functionality. The workshop adds a ton more functionality and content and is the main reason I still play this game.A few essentials mods would be 81 tiles, extra landscaping tools, network extentions, surface painter & props and search box. Most importantly of all, the mod ""Move it!"" allows you to use keyboard controls to move already existing roads and buildings inch by inch. If you are going to downlaod alot of custom assets - Id highly recommend getting ""Loading screen mod"" to see the progress on loading since with a heavy mod loadout, it can feel like the loading screen isnt doing nothing stock."

Yes, if you are looking to play a city building simulator."

Decided to actually look at the DLC5. Noticed that I didn't actually want all the DLC6. Bought Mass Transit DLC7. 10/10 was a good DLC, but the game is also enjoyable without it.Good job, Paradox. You made a good city builder and have made good DLC to go with it, should anyone want some extra stuff. EA could learn a thing or two here.If you want a great city builder that will keep you entertained for a while, here it is. 10/10, would nominate for Mom's Spaghetti again."
67,42.9,Recommended," November 25, 2017",1,"The game is fun and certainly complex, and by using mods you can custiomize the gameplay to suit your style. You can play it as a sim-game or with a more casual approach.It has its flaws though: traffic management could certainly be improved, and once you reach a certain point the game kinda stalls because there is not much more to do. If you enjoy planning and designing you will enjoy how the game plays, but there are no objectives to complete, neither missions or scenarios.A lot of new content has been added with updates and DLCs, and the game seems to have at least a few years of support.I strongly recommend it if you like city building and relaxing for a while."

33,"1,369.6",Recommended," November 24, 2017",1,"This game is quite tough to put down. Between the massive build area and countless maps in the workshop (not to mention the mods, dear god), this thing can keep anyone with a hint of creativity busy for quite literally hundreds of hours. I've put together a couple maps of more than a hundred thousand people, countless towns with painful amounts of detail, and, of course, I've flooded each and every one of those cities when the opportunity came by. Cities: Skylines is not fun in of itself -- the game is tool, much like Maya or Photoshop, that you use to create art. Whether that happens to be a dystopian highway-fest or a place you wouldn't mind calling home, this game is entertaining because it turns pen-and-paper sketches of unreal metropolises into life.TL;DR: Don't get this unless you're eager to slave over optimal grid/freeform layout designs for hours on end."

106,451.2,Recommended," March 16, 2015",1,"UPDATE: A month in and the game remains a delight. Great job, devs.Feels like what Simcity 2013 was meant to be. Easy to pick up, lots of options for complexity, and for me, a fun way to finally build an interesting city without the need for financial constraints - unless I want them. Huge cities are possible and a very nice sense of a living community (especially if you slow things down with one of the mods already out there). With the exception of some weak AA and ambient sounds varying between dull and infurating (those accursed sirens!!!), well worth the $30 price tag, especially knowing that patches and mods will make it even better.Update: After a few weeks playing, I see a growing number of simulation purists starting to beat on the game. I can respect that if they are seeking pure sim engine. But for me, opening the game up with no budget restrictions and logical (if not mind-bending challenges) means I can at last build a MY cities. Actually DESIGN them and while my errors are clear if I screw up, I can work it out and fix it without the sense of fighting the game and losing to a mistake I made hours before. This is just a plain fun and good-looking game with the best ""alive"" feeling I have seen. Mods can make the graphics look really nice and I for one can say this is the best $30 I have spent in a very long time.PS: I am still finding myself grinning like a kid at some things and saying ""now that's great!"" Have you clicked on a seagul and flown it? Buy the game, stuff it full of mods, and build a beautiful city where God doesn't hate you, people live their lives happily, cops don't shoot people, and folks aren't ♥♥♥♥♥ing and rioting on you evey five minutes.What would I change? The ambient sound. It's repetitive and the sirens are very aggrevating. But I am sure that we be moddable, soon enough."

This is what SimCity should have been! I hope you are reading this Maxis. You have ALLOT to learn from these guys. The design, the concept, the artwork are superior. One of the best things about the game is the obvious respect for the player. There is a full editor mode that allows players to create maps contents and MODs. Yup, that's right! The only thing that I wish for are libraries and museums. I can't wait to see what they do next. Thanks for an excellent city building game."

There are many ways to play this game and with the different DLC's there is a lot of variety available. I do think the dlc's are a bit overpriced when just released but buying them right away or waiting on sales is totally up to you.But, I am gonna add this even though it has nothing to do with the vanilla game; the steam workshop community is amazing but that in combination with the DLC's is eating on your performance. Just keep that in mind when you want to buy this game.I wish the traffic/ pathfinding of AI would be different/ better or more realistic but there are ways to work around it, or work with. In the end, this game is fantastic and has a lot to offer. If you like building/ simulation games and such and you don't have Cities: Skylines in your library than shame on you! I am sure I will have a lot more hours of fun playing this game than I already have so far."

The best thing about CS is that it is connected to the steam workshop. With over 90.000 assets/mods you can create the most beautiful regions in the game. Because of this reason the game will always entertain you. 1.5 years after the release the game is still in production, there are still free updates and they are working on DLC's.

I bought the base game for about $21 on sale, and now I see I can buy a DLC that costs $19? It just doesn't make sense. There are some massive improvements that could be made in the base game that everybody just downloads mods for, the modding community for cities skylines is the thing making this game good.

97,12.7,Recommended," August 12, 2017",1,"It's the best city building game ever! Also the best sim i could find ever! It's a bit expensive but worth the money ;)The game is awesome, you can control traffic manage services to almost the full extent. I can spend hours in this game without being bored, tons of replayability. At a point, you might be busy handling the traffic and on the other side you just find out that you forgot to give a necessary service to a part of people.. That's the real fun and challenge about the game. Designing and managing your own city <3. It also has an asset editor so you can make and publish your content and also import somebody else's city for studying it and improving yours :P Overall, AMAZING GAME, WORTH BUYING!10/10"

327,60.6,Recommended," March 11, 2015",1,"Remember Simcity 2013? Remember why that was bad? This game takes all of the bad things about that game and fixes them.That isn't to say it doesn't have its fair share of problems, especially in the way the grids are created in curved roads, or the limited models, or minor issues with traffic pathing, but it generally does significantly better than Simcity 2013.It's very much riding Maxis's (rest in peace) coat tails, but it does it better than they ever could. If you like city builders, this is the one for you."

254,463.4,Recommended," June 30, 2017",1,"Not as focused on micromanagement as Sim City 4 but MUCH easier to use and prettier to look at.Great modding scene as well. Adds a lot of potential playtime to the game.Like any game though i recommend you buy it on sale especially any DLC which is mostly things that should be in the vanilla game but is relegated to paid DLC.Solid game, lots of fun, can be frustrating and stressful."
66,170.2,Recommended," June 9, 2016",1,"It´s a great building-city game, it has bunch of items in it, if it isn´t enought, on workshop are tons of items.This game has only 2 cons :- optimization = i have only a 1k nesseserly addons and you need at least 12 gb of ram, CRAZY!- dlc price = c´mon guys, dlc supposed to be cheap and it wasn´t supposed to suck from your pocket 28 € (13 € and 15€). You could buy for that a new game !"
105,13.8,Recommended," February 9, 2017",1,"I liked this Cities, but it kind of felt like Sim City, except it worked. Build a city and manage everything. It's more fun building then Sim City ever was. There are tons of mods for this game - look them up. Mods that let you change the roads and make better overpasses.I played it all day the first Saturday I got it, and I still play it once in a while.The downside? Remember that stupid papercip from Microsoft called clippy? He's alive and well and is called Chirper. I want Chirper gone."

233,93.9,Recommended," February 19, 2016",1,"It's a smashing game, it really is. You expect a certain level of frustration with games like this not behaving how you want them to, but Cities: Skylines seems virtually frustration-free, which is a splendid achievement.If there's a criticism to be had it's that it's a bit too easy - I find it quite hard to fail in any way and I doubt it's because I'm just great at it. As others have said it might benefit from disasters being added, both in the earthquake sense and economic crashes and the like.But, overall, a tremendous game."
2,83.8,Recommended," February 19, 2016",1,"Cities: Skylines is, in lack of a better description, a super Sim City. Even in the game's community the inhabitants are referred to as ""cims"" (instead of ""sims"").When creating and growing cities, at first the challenge is about budgeting but soon the biggest challenge is about functionality - whether creating new neighbourhoods intelligently or micro-managing the ones that already exist. The ammount of micro-managing, especially traffic, is inversely proportional to the thought you put into creating new neighbourhoods.The game fools you into thinking ""hey, this is easy, i keep an eye on demands and create what they need and the city grows"" but then, when you notice, you have sick citizens because of pollution, burned down buildings because the fireman can't reach the fires, traffic jams that don't allow people to go to work or, even if they do, don't allow cargo trucks to keep the economy working, etc.One thing is for sure, after some hours playing this game, you will think about your own town's city planning whenever you go out and drive."

24,170.0,Recommended," February 19, 2016",1,"Cities: Skylines is probably the new benchmark for City-Builder games. It has so much to give, and so much to love. Not only does it allow us to create our own maps, we get to share them and more with the Steam Workshop! All the possibilities of this game makes it comparably superior to SimCity (2013). If there was one City-Builder you would want to try first, it'd definitely have to be Cities: Skylines."

122,61.5,Recommended, January 18,1,"This isn't a game I sound days upon days playing, but this is a game that no matter when you pick it up or how much time you have put into it, it still feels like a new city building experience. The base game comes with enough material that you wont even look at the DLC until you've put about 50 hours in, and they rejuvenate the game playing experience everytime. I was worried about the controls being hard to learn since my only previous experience with city builders was tropico and the Sim City franchise, but the game gives you freedom without throwing you to the wolves. When you first start, you have basic utilities, and you gain new amnenities as you progress in your city building, which allows you a chance to gain familiarity with the controls without the high risk pressure. Cities Skylines is a relaxing, complex, creative game well worth the price tag. 10/10 would recommend"
64,242.3,Recommended, January 18,1,"I have 218 hours on this game by the time of this review. The game is super addicting. I keep rebuilding the same city over and over again and everytime I set off to fully play a whole map I usually end up playing a quarter of a map before starting again and cannot for the life of me quit. It is an excellent game. Despite never actually ""completing"" a city I am always satisfied. I turn off all sound in the game and put on a podcast and that is how I spend my time on this game. I LOVE IT!"
65,50.5,Recommended, January 18,1,"I waited for this game to go on sale, scooped it up, and let it sit for a while. That was a a mistake! It's a soothing, creative, and fun way to pass the time. With two kids under the age of two in the house, I just don't have time for epic gameplay. This I can play for ten minute stretches and still feel satisfied at the end of the ten minutes. I have also sat down to play after the kids have gone to bed, only to eventually realize hours had gone by while I lost myself in crafting a city."

203,401.1,Recommended," May 10, 2017",1,"Countless Hours spent on this, Great Simulation, unfortunately this game runs like crap on my system, because its cpu bound AND ACTUALLY EVERY SINGLE ""CIM"" IS SIMULATED UNLIKE OTHER GAMES THAT CLAIM TO HAVE THIS FEATURE,after about 300k Population and thousands of workshop mods the fps start to go down gradually. Which sucks, I dont know how a dev is supposed to fix it though, my cpu isn't one of the newer ones, but should still be able to handle stuff like that, dunno, maybe its just meOtherwise, I recommend this game."
181,112.9,Recommended," March 15, 2015",1,"This is the game SimCity should have been.I got a small twinge of anxiety when I saw that the plot of land you start with was just as small as it is in said SimCity, but then I played the game a bit and realized you can actually expand the area later on by buying land, and your first land upgrade comes early on. The game makes your goals and milestones very clear. There are no conflicting messages, and the mechanics of the game are well explained. Especially nice is the ""relocate building"" button, so if you make a huge mistake, or just change your mind down the line, you aren't stuck bulldozing something ridiculously expensive. Even better, the price of the game itself is extremely fair.Fans of City Simulators will love it. While SimCity was full of all sorts of little things that wore away at your patience, Cities: Skylines has all sorts of little things that endear you to it and immerse you. Couldn't recommend it more."
124,75.4,Recommended, January 5,1,"Download mods and keep creating cities better with your imagination. Never feels boring. Too much to do but u need too much RAM too XD. created a map, done layout, started with docks.... finished it with all little things.... saw 12GB ram in use.But this 1 gives satisfaction to creating own things."

Believe me, once you're addicted to this game, you can't stop thinking about zoning and traffic throughout the day. You started to see problems in your neighborhood that you've never realized before. If you're passionate about city building or a SimCity fan as a whole, get this game. Worth it."
230,81.2,Recommended," August 9, 2017",1,"Makes SimCity look like utter s.h.i.t.e. Well done guys! Bazillions of mods out there.Still, a pity the worlds cannot be expanded beyond 25 squares - trying to usefully recreate some real cities is an exercise in economy of scale.

I always loved the idea of building your own city and my friend said I might like this game, He got me it and I have been in love with this game. There is so much in the base game alone so you don't have to worry about dlc issues colliding with the base game. It take abit to get the hang of everything at first, like managing zones, happiness etc. I highly recommend this game if you are looking for a good city builder!10/10"

Really enjoying having a city builder that lets you build a city instead of just a corner of one. Some niggle AI problems but I am sure they will be patched and they are not at all game breaking.Best part, the game is likely to be well supported by the devs with updates and the game is open to modding by the community ensuring plenty of variety, items, buildings and fun.Highly recommended."
193,30.9,Recommended," April 19, 2015",1,"If you liked Sim City 4 then this is the game for you. SimCity was a let down for me, small city and very little room to expand in the game. This is the best city sim I have played in a long time. You can expand your city as your population There are still a few problems that I find like how they all seem to use 1 lane even though other lanes are free to use. Overall if you are in the market for a city simulation game I would only consider this one."
408,17.8,Recommended," March 14, 2015",1,"TL;DR: Bye bys Sim City. Cities Skylines has come to claim the throne of citybuilders, with success but not without (small) flaws.As the name suggests and as I have already said, Cities Skylines is a citybuilder. You start as a mayor of an empty plot of land next to a highway with lush green meadows, hills and rivers. You don't have a task, but you can build the city of your dreams. You build streets, organize public transportations and city services and designate zones for residential, commerce and industry next to streets.So far, so standard. but other games like Sim City or Cities XXL does the same. It doesn't take long to discover the first thing which makes this game special. You don't start with a full tech tree. Instead you start pretty limited and expand as the city grows in size. In addition to just building your city, you can also designate districts where special policies can be applied like modifying tax rates or issue water saving orders. These zones are especially important for industrial zones because you can assign farmland, timber industry or exhaustible resources like oil and ores. That means you don't build special buildings for these ores, just tax private industries, a clear improvement to Sim City.As the city grows, traffic starts to become a problem. Luckily, you have more than enough tools to deal with that problem. Instead of just building two way roads, you can also build one way roads and highways as well as public transportations. You can also expand your territory from Sim City size of 4km³ up to 36km³, with mods even 100km³. The graphics aren't especially beautiful, but it makes fun zooming in to watch how your city grows from a few houses at a gravel road to a busy metropolis full of skyscrapers.Sadly there is one thing that pisses me off. Colossal Order added a feature they call chirper. citizens of regularly send you messages via this in-game twitter ripoff to tell you how much they like the city or tell you if a house is missing a city service. This might be a good idea, but it gets annoying, and worst of all, you can't turn it off. Please CO, make an option to turn that fat blue bird off.Even if chirper is annoying, the game itself is great for a more than reasonable price of less than 30 Euro for the standard edition. I clearly recommend this this game for all city builder fans and strategy enthusiasts, all everyone who got disappointed by EA's Sim City 2013"

You can get very creative with the cities you build and even try to copy world famous cities around the globe. The little people and cars make it all better and adds to the realsiticness (is that a word?). But be warned, you need to have a pretty new and nice computer if you want to avoid MASSIVE lag."
218,634.3,Recommended," March 1, 2017",1,"I was very sceptical at the time about buying yet another city builder because all the previous ones failed my expectations (most of the miserably) and I regretted spending the money. But this a game is the opposite!This game is absolutely amazing. The base game is O.K. but with a very limited number of models for everything it gets boring to even look at very soon - and I think the devs knew that because that's where the best feature of this game comes in - Steam Workshop integration. The community is so amazing that we have hundreds of mods, at least 30 that I'd call indispensable, and tens of thousands of custom assets to choose from. I personally have about 1200 subscriptions on Workshop. That's how good they are.There also have been a couple DLCs. Personally I think, that they don't bring nearly enough on their own to warrant their full price BUT because each of then opens new possibilities for the mod and asset creators it makes them worth so much more... So if you plan on buying DLCs, buy them for the Workshop content they allow you to use :DIf you ever felt like you would enjoy designing a city then this game is definitely for YOU :)"
601,938.6,Recommended," March 18, 2016",1,"After the recent SimCity turned out to be a massive flop, and Cities XXL being...well Cities XL reskinned, the city building genre pretty much looked dead and would probably share the fate of Maxis Studios.Then came Cities: Skylines.I enjoy Cities: Skylines because it's everything I ever wanted in a city builder, unrestrained building, and a virtual populace that actually interacts with the city you built. What that means is unlike Cities XL/XXL the cars and people aren't some visual, your people travel around the city to their jobs, go to places to relax, so on, and need to deal with the issues in between, like traffic.As for unrestrained building, with a bit of button presing and switch flipping you can tailor the game to however you want to play it. Even mod it if its not there already, Cities: Skylines does have a big modding scene.Now in game, you can set up your roads, bridges, tunnels, in anyway you want, make it crazy looking to fix traffic, or just see what you can do for fun, set up building next to it, you got low/high residental, low/high commercial, industrial, a good amount of city planning is involved.You can plan for tourism, traffic fluidity, making everyone happy, typical mainstays of the city builder, long story short, Cities: Skylines is by far the best city builder to have come out recently, I fully recommend it and its expansions."

532,39.2,Recommended," March 14, 2015",1,"I purchased the game today and I haven't stopped playing until now. I've just taken a short break and I decided that I might as well write a review so that I can help spread the word about the greatness that is this game. The fun thing about simcity (not this game obviously) was that I could build chains and make profit that way. Since I haven't seen that specific feature in this game and if my information is correct it isn't in this game at all, I thought that it might decrease my enjoyment of this game.That is not true. In fact, I had intended to wait until the game would go into a sale and then I would purchase it, but I was watching a let's play and I was thinking several times through the let's play episode, man I could do better then this guy. Then I thought, why not go and prove it? If only to myself.I still had some money on my steam wallet from my birthday in februari and I decided -after watching a few more video's just to be sure- that yes, this game is worth the purchase.So I bought the game, downloaded and installed it and like I said in the beginning of my review. I haven't stoppe playing since.I'm going to update this review when I have more hours under my belt and since no game can be perfect, I'm going to be updating this review with what negative points I can find.That said, so far I definetly recommend purchasing this game because you won't regret it for a moment. But if you have any doubts then just watch a couple of let's plays or look for a live stream so you can ask things there to show specific things and specific times.KingdarkEdit: 15/03/2015I realize that this edit is VERY near the time I originally posted the review, but I feel it's worth it. I'm amazed just how EASY it is to make money. Once you get going and get a feel for the system, I had just over a million credits which takes me LOTS longer when I play simcit. Hell, I always go bankrupt with simcity. Seriously.I finally decided I had to take a break because the way I built the city was bad. It is / was my first game and I'm reluctant to just scrap it. My savegame is up for grabs, if you like to try yourself. Anyway, my opinion has not changed and I am of the firm opinion that the game is still worth it and I'm sure that this will not change anytime soon.The only bad thing is that the mods should be monitored more carefully because one of the mods is in turkish or a langauge that is not english or in a scrip I recognize and it should be properly marked.Kingdark"

427,81.0,Recommended," March 25, 2015",1,"Cities: Skylines is an amazing city builder. I haven't playes a Sim city game in a long time, admittedly, but Cities: Skylines really brings the genre to the forefront.The logic to this game is very good, where every peice of traffic or people actually has something to do, rather than just being cosmetic. This does make things a bit trickier, but overall that is much more fun. Similarly, the mechanics of district zoning is something I hadn't expected, but turns out to be really useful.Things do tend to get a bit hectic when you end up with a large population [>100,000], but that may just be due to my own lack of experience.The audio graphical design to this game are really good. It makes it a joy to just sink in to playing for hours. From a wide angle view of the environment, right down to the models of buildings and vehicles it all looks and sounds great. The interface isn't overly complex or cluttered, and it is easy to learn.The modding community to this game is amazing as well, with loads of great content. The devs are even taking hints from various popular mods and integrating relevant additions into the game itself, which is always nice to see. That, and the few gripes I do have about the game [like no tree brushes] can easily be fixed by a mod. They install easily, and I haven't had any game breakages from them.This game is definitely worth buyng if you like city builders, or simulator games of any kind."

Starts off slowly and then becomes increasingly difficult as your city grows and you have to add more stuff to keep things ticking over. Currently having problems with transport but there's heaps of guides on YouTube (Imperial Jedi is easy to watch and learn from and he knows his stuff, and I'm about to use an industrial park plan created by a guy called Akruas which I'm hoping will fix my gridlock). Once I've unlocked all the achievement buildings and monuments I'll be downloading some mods and starting a brand new, even better city with all the tips and tricks I've picked up along the way, and I've also added all the DLC to my wishlist so I've got hundreds of hours more entertainment yet to come.Would spend hours shouting at pleb cims and cursing their ♥♥♥♥♥♥ driving logic again (and again...) 10/10"

27,251.0,Recommended," November 2, 2017",1,"This is the definitive city builder. Anything you could possibly want is in the worksop or is available as DLC (which is by no means necessary to enjoy the game).If you've ever enjoyed a city builder in your life this is a must buy. Even more so if it goes on sale for 75% off!My only critique would be the lack of modular buildings. When a real city outgrows the capabilities of its healthcare system it is rare that the city can afford to build a new hospital. They're most likely going to add a new wing to the one they already have! I would love to see that implemented into Cities Skylines for services like police, healthcare, fire, etc."

That's how I explained this game to all my friends. I loved Simcity 4, not so much the simplistic mess that was Simcity (2013). I love this game because it is more SC4 than Simcity (2013), and it is utterly gorgeous to boot.This game has all the micromangment I loved in SC4, and then some, coupled to an utterly beautiful engine that is not just gorgeous to look at, but it does what it needs to do. This game has a relatively well-working AI that actually makes transportation work. I am utterly in love with the planned routes.I really felt like my cities were alive, and what more, they were my cities. I could name my districts, my transport lines, some facilities, etc. The policies made tweaking everything just a joy. And when I am done tweaking an area, I can watch the city react almost instaneously. I can see the changes at work. For example, I can zoom in real close and see the impact of on pedestrian traffic of that new footpath I added. I can also sit back, and just cruise over my city and watch it just live.If you want a City builder that is like SimCity 4, except newer, this game is most definitely a heavy contender."

176,245.8,Recommended," October 4, 2015",1,"Hey you! Ever wanted a game that is better then Sim City and is addicting? Do you also want to download mods by clicking a simple button? Then this game is for you!Anyways, jokes aside, this game is honestly AMAZING. Its a lot better then that sh!t Sim City, and alot more addicting. This game is really great, and I would seriously recommend this awesome game to you.Onto the Cons and Pros.Pros:After Dark; After Dark is a DLC, but the day and night cycle is free. Once you expand and make your city huge, the night will make it shine more, and make it more beautiful.Highly Addicting; This game is seriously addicting, you will have 10+ hours on this game, trust me.Highly Fun; This game is seriously fun. The mods keeps the game going, and mods also make it even way more fun.Challenging; This game is challenging, with traffic, and demands, this game will make you keep on playing non-stop.Highly Detailed; If you buy this game, I highly recommend you get the first person mod. If you download this, and go in first person, you will see that the civs are highly detailed. With them holding tablets, phones, having watches, and much more. The devs really did put a lot of care and love into this game.Cons:Intel Not Supported; I have a Intel i5 and this game lags alot for me. I read some forums, and apperantly this game doesnt support Intel's. You can still play it, but good luck.Glitches; Sometimes, this game glitches. Like for example, you have 10 incinerators, but your city still says you need to build more. Sometimes the garbage trucks doesn't even go to the building that needs a garbage truck.Conclusion:So, in conclusion, this game is highly fun and addicting, but sometimes glitches. We'll have to wait until they fix the glitches. Anyways, I highly recommend this game to you, and your friends. You will have alot of fun building your city, and will play non-stop. Thank you for reading, and keep building, Mayor!Like this review? Why not check out my other reviews? And why not thumbs up this review? Thanks for reading, and have a wonderful day."

45,187.9,Recommended," November 28, 2016",1,There are some games that are completely addicting and force me to play for just another five minutes (which turns into hours). Cities: Skylines is one of those games. This game does what many city builders cannot. It has the feel of the Sim City series with just a few problems:-Traffic (4 and 6 lane roads are not helpful in most cases)-Not enough people per skyscraper building if you want realism. It's incredibly difficult (potentially impossible) to reach millions of people in your city-Not multiplayer and unable to attach your own cities together to create a bigger metropolis with more traffic issues (that was something that Sim City 4 still does well for singleplayer)Still the majority of the game is amazing fun with challenges to unlock important items for moving forward. I have no idea how many cities I have gone through and it still doesn't get old. It's a must have for anyone who enjoys a simulator.

If you easly lose hours in a haze managing a city, this is definitely the game for you... unless you like having free time, eating food, sleeping, going to work or spending time with your love ones, because all of that will take a backseat to your personal Utopia that you're in chage of."
85,56.5,Recommended," July 16, 2015",1,"Absolutely amazing game, this game is by far the best City builder out there. This game has tons of things to make your city look and work great. If you can't find something you want, just look on the workshop where you'll find a mod for pretty much everything (Yes this game supports mods).So all in all this game is amazing, I would recommend this game to anyone."
67,318.2,Recommended," May 19, 2017",1,"I've played this game a little bit now. I'll give you the tl;dr here: if you're an organization/planning nerd like me and you don't mind a somewhat steep learning curve, you'll probably love Cities: Skylines. If not, you will probably find this game absolutely infuriating.Pros:-UI is tidy and easy to use (once you learn how to use it--more on that later)-Constant new challenges as your city expands (or as it fails, depending on how okay a mayor you are)-Beautiful graphics-Soothing soundtrack-Realistic ebb and flow of population etc.-Ability to micromanage almost everything in the city (although managing individual intersections or buildings is not a thing unless you nab some DLC)Cons:-No tutorial built into the game, besides the little ""hi there, please build a road"" blurb you get at the beginning. I think I started three different cities and trial-and-errored them into oblivion before I finally broke down and found a few game guides.-There are, in theory, 25 tiles available for purchase, but you can only purchase 9 of them unless you mod. While that is probably a bit of a pro for some people because of the challenge, it's a con for me because I prefer to expand copiously. There's also no indication that this is the case until you buy 9 tiles and can suddenly not purchase any more. (Also note that if you mod it so you can buy more tiles, you can no longer obtain any achievements. I don't care about that much, but for those who do, I imagine this would be frustrating, although understandable from a dev's perspective.)-The inability to directly manage buildings, while certainly realistic, can be extremely aggravating. For example, I sometimes have had giant waves of death sweep my city and the cemeteries and crematoriums (totally a word) will be sending out like 2/10 available hearses, despite the constant messages I'm getting about how dead bodies are piling up everywhere. I've found that placing a crematorium right next to a cemetery mostly solves this problem, but it's still a bit ridiculous, and you can't do anything about it with, say, policies.In total, 8/10 I play this game far more frequently than is probably healthy. Beware the siren call of city planning."

If you enjoy creating your own city and watching it grow, then this is a game for you. I would recommend this game because there are many possibilities you have in the game, so it doesn't feel as though you are repeating yourself when it comes to creating your own city. Also, don't even get me started on the multiple more possibilities you can have when you browse the workshop for Cities: Skylines. In my opinion, it is worth the money."

101,46.6,Recommended, February 19,1,"This is one of those games which falls under the ""easy to learn, difficult to master"" categories. I picked it up on sale, and during the first few hours it really did a good job of showing me the ropes. The mechanics, interface and design are all intuitive. Yes, with time you realize additional menus that make things even better, but the game is definitely easier to pick up on then some other simulators out there (I’m looking at you planet coaster). Visually, the game is very pleasing.Within a few hours my city had grown to a respectable size. Little did know what troubles were in store for me! one word.... TRAFFIC...... I made some poor design choices when placing my roads. Couple that with poor placement of industry, commercial zones too many high rise residential areas. ineffective public transport system and you have the ingredients for a disaster. Traffic became so bad that my services couldn’t get around to clearing out garbage, putting out fires, moving the dying, fighting crime and so on. People started to move out and the next milestone of my cities growth was out of reach (mile stones unlock additional tech for your city i.e. better power plants, new buildings, trains, airplanes, etc...). I went back to the drawing board, did some research on road design, interchanges and started to build a better city next time round.What makes this game even more fantastic is the wonderful community. Tons of videos and guides are out there to help you and give you new perspectives. Additionally, the modding community has developed some wonderful material for this game. Some of it is a must for when you play. For example, mods for additional bus designs or new car types, or different buildings. Or pre-created interchanges to save you time building them yourself. I advise you do some research into the best mods and utilize them to make your experience even better."

The game makes your goals and milestones very clear. There are no conflicting messages, and the mechanics of the game are well explained. Especially nice is the ""relocate building"" button, so if you make a huge mistake, or just change your mind down the line, you aren't stuck bulldozing something ridiculously expensive. Even better, the price of the game itself is extremely fair.Fans of City Simulators will love it.

1,62.9,Recommended," December 5, 2017",1,Hands down best building simulator I have ever played.While not without its flaws (I'm looking at you garbage and traffic) the amount of depth and gameplay you can get out of Cities:Skylines leaves it with a high replayability factor (this is even before looking to the multitide of different features added via DLC).Cities:Skylines is charming and perfectly captures the nostalgia of playing SimCity as a kid in the most wonderful way.
117,154.5,Recommended," March 29, 2015",1,"Not been much into city-builders before but this one got me. It's great and comes highly recommended.Massive scope, customisation, diversity, loads of content, simple and intuitive UI, actions have consequences. This game is a master-class of the genre as far as I can tell. To criticise this game for any shortcomings is to discount the extensive modding community it has so I'll just say that there are virtually no flaws in the game that I am aware of. It is the perfect city-builder and to not get it if you are interested is a meagre favour to your wallet but a disservice to your gaming experince; 10/10 would city again."

Gone was the offline gameplay, replaced with always online DRM. Gone, was Simcity.And so, Cities Skylines stepped in to fill that void, and it does so wonderfully. THIS is the game that Simcity (5) should have been. If you are looking for a good city building game, this is it.There is no better alternative."

192,46.1,Recommended, February 12,1,"i rather like this game. i don't think i am good at it. but it is a good game and if you like city builders you should play this one. City Skyline, is the best city builder i have ever played."
14,225.9,Recommended, February 9,1,"The game makes hour fly by as you build that perfect downtown layout that FINALLY, doesn't have loads of traffic and is connected throughout your map. The game is way better with mods and i would recomend that new people definitly cheak the workshop out."
3,713.5,Recommended, February 10,1,"Absolutely outstanding! Would definitely reccomend over any other city building game, it is a pleasure to play and gives you unlimited controls over realistic-looking cities. It has an extended workshop with mods, assets, maps and themes (etc.) straight from the community. Has very good graphics. The 'traffic' could, however, be somehow improved as can cause a problem at times, though I think that the game is absolutely wonderful nevertheless."
539,535.3,Recommended, February 10,1,"I've dropped over 500 hours into C:SL since its purchase. While I play it a bit less now in favor of a lot of hacking and slashing and looting all of the things, it's not a knock against the city builder in any way.It's the kind of game I can sit down with, play for a few hours, and enjoy dealing with the city building and the chaos that can come with it, whether it's a poorly planned interchange, a surprise flood in a scenario, or goodness knows what else.I was looking for a city builder after getting burned not once, but twice on CitiesXL and its ilk, and at that time, this game was new and had promise. I've lost entire weekends to crazy city builds, and I'm not sorry for that time lost."
179,22.6,Recommended," January 26, 2016",1,"I believe that Cities: Skylines is an engaging sandbox game that offers lots of fun, outstanding replay value, and gives us a breath of fresh air after the abomination, SimCity.

It's all the magic of Sim-City with the perks of a brand-new game, a modding community, and producers who are willing to work witht he community to add additional content and fix current.10/10Already neglecting life to play it.Oh, and it's not made by EA, so there's a bonus. You don't need to be online to play it, there's no microtransation nonsense. No strings attached, like games are meant to be.PS. Be careful when building dams. I built one upstream of my waste output pipes and because there was another branch in the river, all i did was block the current. The waste water then backed up to my water intakes, and the entire population started to get sick. Next thing I know, I'm out of money, the city's infastructure has collapsed, I'm going into debt, and and I can't fix the water issues because I have no money.Needless to say, I accidentally created Detroit."

Its surprizingly efficient and isnt bery laggy even on an old computer.

And last but not least, I want them to add trams cuz they go with the road and its kinda convenient."
63,1.4,Recommended," October 12, 2015",1,"""Cities: Skylines"" is a game about building and managing a player created city/town/village/megapolis/etc. . It's a complete sandbox with great support from the Steam Workshop. The community creations only give even more detail to the already great game.It also features a map making tool/mode, that invites a large portion of players to add and share their creations on the workshop.There are minor gripes I, personally, have, such as the ability to disable traffic lights or improve the driver AI, for example. But wait, the unlimited support from the modding community HAS made it possible!So, in the end, I rate this game with a 9/10, the only major problem being the simplistic AI, that can ruin a trully great city, if for some reason your mods suddenly stop existing."
71,50.5,Recommended," October 12, 2015",1,"This game was the answer to my questions. Long after SimCity 4 has fallen by the wayside and it's processing limitations become glaring, this game rose to save my sanity.Many people will claim this is more of a sandbox rather than a difficult city building game; while that may be true, I think it is in fact plenty difficult. Most, if not all of your time will be probably be spent managing that godawful traffic. Learn the ways of the roundabout and the one-way street, and those problems can be conquered. Intersections are evil.Pros:+Large play area+Realistic graphics+Realistic simulations+Runs relatively well on older systems (see below)+Allows nearly-infinte city customization+Hydro dams!+Tons of mods to fix many game problems+Allows you to create your own vehicle/building assetsCons:-Dumb traffic AI-Pollution is too friendly-Street planning can be a nightmare due to lack of advanced tools-Eats RAM like there's no tomorrowIf you're a micromanaging SOB who hates drag-and-drop automatic games and wants to create graceful curving traffic systems, this is for you. If you still cling to your SimCity 2000 CD like it's a matter of life and death, you better get this game. If you're still playing SimCity BuildIt on your 2010 tablet, you probably aren't ready for this."

15,282.5,Recommended," September 18, 2016",1,"Great game. Its better than Simcity in many ways. Dont compare this to Simcity. Simcity feels like an arcade after playing this gem of a simulator. Its everything you wanted simcity to ever be, but has failed to deliver time and again. Alot more depth on your city designs, and actually watch your city grow into a huge Metropolitan. The only thing I do not like is the fact that you cannot go in to more depth with charts and scales and see a history of your economies well being. But dont let that deter you from trying this out. I got it on sale awhile back for 10 bucks, next time you should too, if you like city sims, and this is one of the best I must say."

This is the city builder i was waiting for. The steam workshop integration is a huge thing and there will come awesome things out of it! This is the best city builder i can think of and i highly recommend it. Don't expect a lot of tutorials but you'll learn by failing if you're not so familiar with this genre."
176,141.6,Recommended," July 13, 2015",1,"Rewriting this review because I can. And my old one wan't good. I've also played many more hours since then.So, in Cities:Skylines, you build cities. You control the taxes, roads, services, policies for districts, more roads and traffic, and that should be enough to entice you.After the disaster of SimCity 5 (2013), pretty much any other city builder is better. Now, this game took everything that got right (which wasn't that much . . .), got everything that SimCity 4 got right, made mods the best thing in the world, and a fantastic game was made.Never has any game just been so . . . good. I can't explain it. There are a few downsides, though.SimCity 5 had this one nice mechanic of ""upgrading"". That was cool. That's less important, since this game is the perfect mix between fun and simulator (SimCity 5 tried for fun, but it needed to go simulator, so there's another reason it's bad). Instead of a wind turbine farm, just place down each with so ""hub station"", or whatever they are.So it's worst thing isn't even that bad.Mods: They're fantastic. 'Nuff said.And on a side note, this is my favorite game on Steam. It beat Prison Architect, my now second favorite. This game is REALLY AMAZING."
558,174.6,Recommended," June 9, 2015",1,"Guide your plebs into existense and then murder them with their own excrement. 10/10City Simulator which does not include aliens, volcanos, tornadoes, or water-nados. 5/10The danger is lower, so the challenge is small, but it also isn't tedious. 6/10The grid is big to keep you alive, expand north, east, south, or west. 10/10It's got districts to help segregate the populations you don't like. Truckers don't go here, rich pants go here, and you people without educations don't go here, here, or here, but you can go here. If you like technology then you're welcome here. Could use more segregation tools to help futher keep the plebs down but I'm sure mods will work on that. 8/10The utilities are too easy to manage for my likeing it's almost like they just want you to make your city bigger, but I approve, the faster they rise, the faster you can kill them all and get that cemetery achievable. 6/10The viewables are pretty, and stable, they don't spasm and run across the screen. 8/10The modding is open and the community is sophisticated, awesome mods incoming. 10/10Over all, you do the math, but I think you're better off wasting time on this game them figure out the score."
172,53.2,Recommended," March 23, 2015",1,"I hear this is a great game for discerning fans of city sims. That may be, but all I can say is that it's also a great game for casual players, too. I don't play games like this for the challenge; I play for the city porn. That means I get great satisfaction out of attractive city blocks, creative neighborhoods, and tidy traffic flows. In Cities: Skylines I can indulge in that from the beginning, effortlessly enabling the mods I want for the experience I want. I also have to say this game is remarkably stable: I hasn't crashed on me once, and that's with the addition of dozens of workshop mods, some of which I installed in the middle of a savegame."
45,54.4,Recommended," November 27, 2017",1,"If you enjoy city builing on a truly massive scale, then this is defininately the game for you! Don't be fooled buy the two year old game play reviews on this game, it truly is worth your money.The only negative aspect about the franchise in my opinion is the cost of the DLC... That said, It still is a great game and i would recommend it to anyone who is in dire straits for a fresh perspective on large scale city building with great reward and a sense of accomplishment waiting around every turn.What really got me excited about this game is just how much better it is than simcity, but how much better it looks and feels. You are not limited to a small little space for building a city so small that eventually every corner you tried to keep seperate touches.In Cities:Skylines, you can really unleash your inner city builder and build a metropolis rivaled only but what is in your mind.The graphics in this game are also an absoulte wonder. If you wonder why, wait for nightfall and level out the camera to look over your city. Look at the water flowing in the rivers near your city, or even better, build a hydroelectric dam in your region and just watch the water build up on one end and drop down on the other. Watch your city closely during a rainy day or watch a forrest fire engulf half the wooded map in your region. What more is there???This game truly sets itself apart from any other city builder out there in more ways than I care to elaborate on.Go ahead and buy it, you won't be dissapointed!"

151,43.0,Recommended," September 24, 2015",1,"This is probably the best city simulator I have ever played.I was weary of getting this since the last city simulator to come out, Sim City, was a total disaster. But I saw this and everyone saying how good it was so I gave it a shot. It was the best $30 I have ever spent. Well worth it.Some of the features I love are how you can rename not only the buildings, but the people themselves. If you have a problem with saving money, you can either fix that in the economy panel or you can turn off a building. The people rarely complain about taxes up until about 15%, which is lovely as well.Some problems with the game that I have are the traffic (which can be fixed with mods I assume) and theres no weather system yet, which I hope Colossal Order and Paradox can bring in the future. Otherwise, do buy this game. You will not be disappointed."

The workshop adds a ton more functionality and content and is the main reason I still play this game.A few essentials mods would be 81 tiles, extra landscaping tools, network extentions, surface painter & props and search box. Most importantly of all, the mod ""Move it!"" allows you to use keyboard controls to move already existing roads and buildings inch by inch. If you are going to downlaod alot of custom assets - Id highly recommend getting ""Loading screen mod"" to see the progress on loading since with a heavy mod loadout, it can feel like the loading screen isnt doing nothing stock."

The mods provide sexy additions which helps a lot. Steam workshop IS apart of C:Skylines. Very convient!Anyways, to the main review.Graphics: The game is VERY beautiful. I have a powerful-ish rig, and it runs too good on it. One of my friends has a pc from 2009 (very outdated, a ati hd 3450 and intel pentium). and he gets 50fps on it low. The game is optimized and the developers did a darn good job doing so. 9.5/10Sound: It sounds like a real city. I'd say it sounds very good and detailed. 8.5/10 A big higher quality would be better, but I am not focusing on the sound, as most people that play this aren't playing it for the sound.Gameplay: Well, heres the real deal. It's VERY good. Alright, I think I'm going to hire Donald Trump to say it: ""It's YUUUUGGEEEE and very great folks!"" Yes, it's very great. Honestly, you WILL spend hours on this. You could say: ""Eh, I'm going to play for an hour""... *2 hours later* ""Well, another 30 minutes""... *2 hours later*... ""Oh, ****, my bad for missing work!"". (Just kidding, but it's very addicting to those seeking a good city builder, and sandbox game. The gameplay is smooth and pretty simple. You will NOT break your back trying to learn the ropes. It might take some practice to not have as much traffic jams, and doing roads correctly... but that is where your creativity comes in. Either way, to make it short... 9.7/10. (I would like to see smarter AI in the base game)Re-Playable: I consider re-playable to be: You can play it times and times again, with no issue getting back into it. It will last you HOURS... and probably months. Especially with Steam WS! 10/10Overall: 9.5/10, just a devine and sexy game. I like flooding my citizens if they have a bad attitude. (Oh, they like getting wet).TLDR; Worth the money. Play it, I am 99.99% sure you will love it.MY ONE TIP: MAKE SURE YOU PLAN YOUR ZONES OUT. Industrial zones should have a direct connection to the highway. As well as commercial zones. Make sure you get a mass transit system up too. It helps. AND you WILL likely have traffic jams. DO NOT FLIP OUT. You can solve it by adding more exits/enterances and spacing out the zones."

2,19.2,Recommended," November 24, 2016",1,Great successor to the SimCity games. Just chill out and watch your city grow until you realize it's 4am and you really need to go to bed.
198,555.2,Recommended," April 14, 2016",1,"This game is pretty good. It simulates building beautiful cities well and the player has a decent level of freedom in what they build. Mods enable a higher level. Speaking of mods there are quite a few great ones that should be in the base game. Like the ability to turn sirens off, without this mod everytime you move the camera to street level you will be deafened by ambo, fire and police sirens.Whats lacking from this game is dept in its management element, what's present is Ultra basic and really boring. I would have liked to see a large expansion to this element, I fear however that if they did get around to explaining city management it would likely be costly DLC.A lot of the dlc for this game isn't worth it so consider if it adds elements your like vs how much it costs."
27,251.0,Recommended," November 2, 2017",1,"This is the definitive city builder. Anything you could possibly want is in the worksop or is available as DLC (which is by no means necessary to enjoy the game).If you've ever enjoyed a city builder in your life this is a must buy. Even more so if it goes on sale for 75% off!My only critique would be the lack of modular buildings. When a real city outgrows the capabilities of its healthcare system it is rare that the city can afford to build a new hospital. They're most likely going to add a new wing to the one they already have! I would love to see that implemented into Cities Skylines for services like police, healthcare, fire, etc."

I was super dissappointed by Sim City when it came out, thank goodness this game came out soon after it. City building in this game is super fun, managing it can be difficult at times, but if you are smart, you can easily build a big city. I 100% recommend this game to anyone who is into these types of games"
9,348.7,Recommended," January 15, 2017",1,"It's a great game however I did find the beginning bit hard as there wasn't a clear cut tutorial (or maybe there was and I accidentally skipped it).Anyway with the help of some online forums, steam community assets & mods I was able to figure out what to doThis is one of the good things about the game that it's so raw and simplistic but yet at the same time being jam packed and rather complex.Mods are a definite reccomendation to playing this game unless you are trying to go for achievements. (Enabling any mod disables achievements).The downside to this game was:a) The lack of a in depth tutorialb) Having to put down electrical lines & water lines myself (personally they should be included in all roads).That's it for my review.This game is a definite reccomend9/10 - Gameplay7/10 - Beginning10/10 - Community9/10 - Mods & AssetsAll up:8.25 / 10"

63,126.7,Recommended," November 25, 2016",1,"This game is for people who like the topic of city planning and organisation. Gives much more possibilities than SimCity 4 used to have (this was my last such game). I really like it for the possibility to make such things like custom highway junctions, bus and railway lines, and so on. Combining this with the asset editor and workshop availability it makes it possible to create the city the way you like to, with very little limitations.The only thing that may frustrate in this game is the traffic that needs to be managed in the proper way to avoid long jams which as result makes it impossible for city services to do their job. I still don't excel in it, though."

47,31.3,Recommended, February 6,1,"As you open this game you become very involved and even addicted to your city. The more your city grows the more is required from the player. As your city surpasses 100,000 people you realize you its 6am 2 days later and you havent moved from your desk. Long story short, this game ruined my life."
123,9.5,Recommended, February 7,1,"Been thinking for 2 or 3 years now about whether or not to get this game. I was put off by all the DLC comments, but the core game seems pretty sweet and better than any sim city or other city builder game that I have played so far."

147,22.6,Recommended, February 23,1,"Great EngineGood GraphicsYou have a lot of tools to make truely a great city with a lot of detail and depth.Fun and realistic disaters and ways to combat themFor a biginner managing traffic in efficient way is EXTREMLY hard once you hit around 50.000+ population but the taffic system is quite complex and has a lot of depth to it so its probably the most challenging aspect of the game.Overall probably the best ""City Building and Simulation"" game out there."
45,187.9,Recommended," November 28, 2016",1,There are some games that are completely addicting and force me to play for just another five minutes (which turns into hours). Cities: Skylines is one of those games. This game does what many city builders cannot. It has the feel of the Sim City series with just a few problems:-Traffic (4 and 6 lane roads are not helpful in most cases)-Not enough people per skyscraper building if you want realism. It's incredibly difficult (potentially impossible) to reach millions of people in your city-Not multiplayer and unable to attach your own cities together to create a bigger metropolis with more traffic issues (that was something that Sim City 4 still does well for singleplayer)Still the majority of the game is amazing fun with challenges to unlock important items for moving forward. I have no idea how many cities I have gone through and it still doesn't get old. It's a must have for anyone who enjoys a simulator.
171,11.5,Recommended," June 13, 2015",1,"This game perfectly scratches the itch that SIm City hasn't scratched since Sim City 4. If you easly lose hours in a haze managing a city, this is definitely the game for you... unless you like having free time, eating food, sleeping, going to work or spending time with your love ones, because all of that will take a backseat to your personal Utopia that you're in chage of."

8,872.9,Recommended," July 23, 2016",1,"All I can say for this game is, wow. This game came from a small company, and they managed to outsell Simcity, a hugely successful game in the past. In the days when it was first released, I was awstruck with how open the world was. It was not as beautiful as simcity then, sad to say. As a year went by, many things were added, like playing on 81 tiles, through a mod, tunnels, day and night, weather. It became quite beautiful and full of potencial. It is the most creative city builder I have ever played. The vanilla game itself is a little sparse though, such as with tall buildings. It almost becomes a requirement for the player to go to the steam workshop to add assets and what not to the game.But, the downside of this game is that to be able to utilize all of the possibilites of mods and assets to the full extent, you need a medium to top notch computer. Not to say you need one to play. You can play it fine with a few add ons. Paradox, please do not lose the values that you incorparated into this game franshise, like the modding community and creative freedom. If you learn from the mistakes of others, such as the failure of always online in simcity, you can make a hugely successful game that out competes everyone else. You made a great game here, and I hope you support it for years to come, and maintain the modding community like sim city 4 did. I hope you stick to the same values as you did here for your next city builder game.I give this game a 15/10. I absolutely love this game."

539,535.3,Recommended, February 10,1,"I've dropped over 500 hours into C:SL since its purchase. While I play it a bit less now in favor of a lot of hacking and slashing and looting all of the things, it's not a knock against the city builder in any way.It's the kind of game I can sit down with, play for a few hours, and enjoy dealing with the city building and the chaos that can come with it, whether it's a poorly planned interchange, a surprise flood in a scenario, or goodness knows what else.I was looking for a city builder after getting burned not once, but twice on CitiesXL and its ilk, and at that time, this game was new and had promise. I've lost entire weekends to crazy city builds, and I'm not sorry for that time lost."
3,713.5,Recommended, February 10,1,"Absolutely outstanding! Would definitely reccomend over any other city building game, it is a pleasure to play and gives you unlimited controls over realistic-looking cities. It has an extended workshop with mods, assets, maps and themes (etc.) straight from the community. Has very good graphics. The 'traffic' could, however, be somehow improved as can cause a problem at times, though I think that the game is absolutely wonderful nevertheless."

179,22.6,Recommended," January 26, 2016",1,"I believe that Cities: Skylines is an engaging sandbox game that offers lots of fun, outstanding replay value, and gives us a breath of fresh air after the abomination, SimCity. The gamers wanted this game and the devs delivered. Highly recommended if you like this style of game."
17,"1,291.0",Recommended, February 20,1,"What do I say about Cities Skylines? Is it what Sim City 5 should have been? No. The game is barely playable in its basic form. The base game could not even compare to Sim City 4. It is also is not as fun Sim city 2013. This game had a lot of different goals and achievements which can lead to hours and hours of game-play trying to figure out how to optimize each map for optimal resource harvesting. However, Cites Skylines has an amazing community of players, modders and asset makers that makes the game great and very realistic. With saying that though once you start modding and downloading assets the game can become very unstable if you are not careful. The interface that is used to add, download and organize the mods and assets is less then adequate, and can become complicated with assets that contain props and dependencies. It is also extremely slow and temperamental. In addition, the game also needs to be better optimized for multi-cored systems and higher end graphics cards to improved performance in the later stages of the game. Overall though I played over 1000 hours so once you get a good city going it can be hard to peel yourself away from the screen. Once you get over what the game is missing, the graphical and interface challenges, the game can be quite.. addictive."

44,169.3,Recommended," December 10, 2016",1,"Cities: Skylines, the best thing ever.TLDR: Well worth the money. Try it out, see if you enjoy it.I have written a few long reviews prior for different games, I'll try and keep this short. However, this game is just too fun. I usually play shooters, and RTS games, and I really thought when I purchased it that it would be poop. NOPE. I WAS WAY TO WRONG. It provides gameplay that is so simple, yet so good. The mods provide sexy additions which helps a lot. Steam workshop IS apart of C:Skylines. Very convient!Anyways, to the main review.Graphics: The game is VERY beautiful. I have a powerful-ish rig, and it runs too good on it. One of my friends has a pc from 2009 (very outdated, a ati hd 3450 and intel pentium). and he gets 50fps on it low. The game is optimized and the developers did a darn good job doing so. 9.5/10Sound: It sounds like a real city. I'd say it sounds very good and detailed. 8.5/10 A big higher quality would be better, but I am not focusing on the sound, as most people that play this aren't playing it for the sound.Gameplay: Well, heres the real deal. It's VERY good. Alright, I think I'm going to hire Donald Trump to say it: ""It's YUUUUGGEEEE and very great folks!"" Yes, it's very great. Honestly, you WILL spend hours on this. You could say: ""Eh, I'm going to play for an hour""... *2 hours later* ""Well, another 30 minutes""... *2 hours later*... ""Oh, ****, my bad for missing work!"". (Just kidding, but it's very addicting to those seeking a good city builder, and sandbox game. The gameplay is smooth and pretty simple. You will NOT break your back trying to learn the ropes. It might take some practice to not have as much traffic jams, and doing roads correctly... but that is where your creativity comes in. Either way, to make it short... 9.7/10. (I would like to see smarter AI in the base game)Re-Playable: I consider re-playable to be: You can play it times and times again, with no issue getting back into it. It will last you HOURS... and probably months. Especially with Steam WS! 10/10Overall: 9.5/10, just a devine and sexy game. I like flooding my citizens if they have a bad attitude. (Oh, they like getting wet).TLDR; Worth the money. Play it, I am 99.99% sure you will love it.MY ONE TIP: MAKE SURE YOU PLAN YOUR ZONES OUT. Industrial zones should have a direct connection to the highway. As well as commercial zones. Make sure you get a mass transit system up too. It helps. AND you WILL likely have traffic jams. DO NOT FLIP OUT. You can solve it by adding more exits/enterances and spacing out the zones."

339,34.2,Recommended," March 11, 2015",1,"From loving games such as Sim City and Roller coaster Tycoon I have been looking for a good city management game for some time. I can spend countless hours reworking roads to improve traffic flow and find laying water pips to be a peaceful experience. If that’s you, you might want to give this game a go.Unlike sim city, which it barrows heavily from there are no disasters. The biggest threat to your citizens will be fire. My few play throws the fire became a pain in how many burnt buildings I had to bulldoze. Though that was partly my fault I got rid of a street connecting the fire house. You could say the game was trying to bring my attention to this by burning the people of my city.City: Skylines is the definition of a city builder simulation game. Its goal is to give you the tools to create a prosperous city the way you see fit. Through a wonderful mechanic called districts I could regulate an industry heavy district to provide farm goods. Personally I like my cities to be eco-friendly and concentrate on resident happiness instead of trying to make the most profitable city I can.From years of playing these types of games, the fun comes from living the fantasy of running your own city your way. City: Skylines seems to understand this. From their UI and overall look of the game people will compare it to Sim City 2013. Though I think as time goes on people will start to point out how this game sets it self apart. You can only see this through playing it. It's a warm and welcoming feeling for people that want to dive into a city they can make into their own.This game also comes with a map and assets editor. From little I got to play with this feature I have to say its nice to create your own intersections to use in your maps. It keeps things uniform and saves you time from wasting cash and deleting unnecessary from roads that you have to replace, anyways.The developers have thought of steam workshop integrating from the get go. From seeing games of this type try to integrate other players into your game, like having a multiplayer function I much rather have this type of integration where players can add to each other's cities through making unique props, buildings and intersections.I would recommend this game to anyone that love city management games. It's one of the better ones."
58,524.1,Recommended," April 28, 2015",1,Playing for some weeks now. And it is absolutely amazing.Still figuring out how to optimalize my cities.Pros:- Mods- Large cities (been busy with a city for a few weeks now and still haven't got 50% full)- Easy way of making mods- Nice graphic styleCons:- A lot is focused on the traffic- Some aspects that should have been covered in the game itself like the treebrush that are missing.

Running out of money is a lot tougher, and there's a lot more to manage like the size of your roads, sewage, and cemetaries. The game starts off really slow as, unline in SimCity where unlocks are based on the year, the unlocks here are based on population, so you start off with coal power and no high-density zoning. Over time, the game opens up, and you get a lot of room to build and experiment. If you like city builders, this game is definitely a solid 9/10, it shines in comparison to the likes of the newer and even the classic SimCities."

198,555.2,Recommended," April 14, 2016",1,"This game is pretty good. It simulates building beautiful cities well and the player has a decent level of freedom in what they build. Mods enable a higher level. Speaking of mods there are quite a few great ones that should be in the base game. Like the ability to turn sirens off, without this mod everytime you move the camera to street level you will be deafened by ambo, fire and police sirens.Whats lacking from this game is dept in its management element, what's present is Ultra basic and really boring. I would have liked to see a large expansion to this element, I fear however that if they did get around to explaining city management it would likely be costly DLC.A lot of the dlc for this game isn't worth it so consider if it adds elements your like vs how much it costs."

City builders and strategy games (such as Civ 5) are neck and neck for my favorite genre and have the most playtime by far than any other type of game.Also, it is exceedingly rare that I rate anything 10/10. I am one of those people who will rate something 9/10. You really have to blow me away to get a 10/10 out of me. That being said, I am giving this game 10/10.It is the best city builder ever created, hands down and I have been playing them since Sim City 2000 came out. This blows Sim City 5 completely out of the water and is obviously targeted to do so (the price point, mod-ability, and city size).Playing the game or reading the other positive reviews will tell you why that is the case, so I won't get into the gritty details."

78,87.4,Recommended," December 23, 2017",1,"So much DLC!Would recommend for any world builder or simulation fan but only on sale.Recommended DLC: After Dark (includes cycle lanes and dedicated bus lanes to enhance public transport system).Good+ I did enjoy this game a lot, however, I would not recommend buying it unless on sale. The game is not worth the price especially if you were considering purchasing DLC as well.+ Easy to get the hang of the game so you can focus on building great cities.+ No issues with lagging or glitches.+ Very addictive.+ DLC is not essential to play some have great features that do benefit the game. Once again however, buy these on sale they are very overpriced. Do your research about which will benefit your vision for your city. After Dark does seem to be the top recomendation.- Again with the DLC!! Not willing to pay $3.50 for a radio station. Some of the DLC are complete ripoffs for their price. Looking into it they only add a couple of features for what you pay.- Very addictive.* DLCOverall the biggest gripe is the amount of DLC attached to the game and the cost of them but these are not essential for most players."
71,35.7,Recommended," February 11, 2017",1,"So after trying this game on hard mode without any mods it is way more challenging. So challenging no one moves into your city. After reinstalling the game people started moving in. I have spent hours building my city...I think I will spend hours more.Don't get me wrong...I love this game. It is just too easy. Without any sort of tutorials or trying to make an extremely efficient city I was able to get to 80k residents in 6 hours of gameplay. I will continue to play the game but being able to unlock everything in so little time is quite a bit of a turn off for me. Still a great game. If it is signifigantly harder with the hard mode on I will try that, but otherwise it seems like my review is going to have to be negative."

330,54.8,Recommended," May 31, 2016",1,"I feel like a year after release I have a good opinion on the game, its DLC and the devs.Good:- Massive scale, huge maps and up to 1,000,000 people can live in your city- Mods & Steam workshop support (probably the best thing about this game)- Looks cute- Overall a very enjoyable city builder- Free updates everytime they release a DLC- CheapBad:- Traffic can be stupid at times and is your worst enemy.- Deathwaves - people tend to die at the same time, so half of your city will be covered in corpses every once in a while- Edges look weird, even with AA- Performance issues- DLC is a bit overpriced- You can't see♥♥♥♥♥♥at night- Rain has no soundVerdict:Although I stopped playing I feel like I got my money's worth. It is better than Sim City and solves a lot of its problems but at the same time it has its own issues. There are mods to improve almost every issue I have with this game but it can get tiring to be forced to install them. More DLC is planned, the devs seem like nice people and I generally recommend this game at any price."

202,122.4,Recommended," August 16, 2015",1,"this game...its stunning. Ive played it for over 20 hours, im an avid fan of citybuilders, before this game, i tried cities XL, oh boy, that game was pretty bad, but this. This is what SimCity 5 shouldve been from the start, this is one of the best citybuilding games ever made, it even goes toe to toe with simcity itself, if you havent bought this game yet, please do, its worth all the money, its worth all of your time, its amazing. And the amount of mods, oh my god, theres thousands of mods, thousands of maps and assets, if you need extra stuff, there is probably already a mod for that.all in all, get this game, its worth every penny, its worth more than that, id buy this game as a 60 euro release, its worth that much in my opinion."
113,28.5,Recommended," July 23, 2015",1,"This satisfies my need to lord over things, in a socially acceptable setting. The game has a lot of detail, ( much more than I expected when I picked it up) and the right type of frustration (I KNOW I can do better! START OVER!). No IAP, No forced cooperation / socialization or external log-ins, No manipulative behaviour meant to induce you to keep playing, and an awesome collection of mod items that enhance the feel, such as an FP camera (ride along with your citizens!), Day/night cycle, and tons of user made aesthetic items. Polished feeling sim done right."

8,872.9,Recommended," July 23, 2016",1,"All I can say for this game is, wow. This game came from a small company, and they managed to outsell Simcity, a hugely successful game in the past. In the days when it was first released, I was awstruck with how open the world was. It was not as beautiful as simcity then, sad to say. As a year went by, many things were added, like playing on 81 tiles, through a mod, tunnels, day and night, weather. It became quite beautiful and full of potencial. It is the most creative city builder I have ever played. The vanilla game itself is a little sparse though, such as with tall buildings. It almost becomes a requirement for the player to go to the steam workshop to add assets and what not to the game.But, the downside of this game is that to be able to utilize all of the possibilites of mods and assets to the full extent, you need a medium to top notch computer. Not to say you need one to play. You can play it fine with a few add ons. Paradox, please do not lose the values that you incorparated into this game franshise, like the modding community and creative freedom. If you learn from the mistakes of others, such as the failure of always online in simcity, you can make a hugely successful game that out competes everyone else. You made a great game here, and I hope you support it for years to come, and maintain the modding community like sim city 4 did. I hope you stick to the same values as you did here for your next city builder game.I give this game a 15/10. I absolutely love this game."

Would definitely recommend to anybody!"
73,866.9,Recommended," December 27, 2016",1,Absolutely amazing game.Did you enjoy SimCity but always wished there was more depth to the game?Cities:Skylines brings every fan's SimCity wants into one game. If EA actually listened to its community it might have a game half this good.You can play this game so many times (even on the same map) and develop your city however you feel. Feel like a railroad city? Try and make it work. Want to be the center of commerece? try and make it work. Want to have a city without stoplights? Try and make it work. Everything about a city planning sim you could ever want.
174,30.1,Recommended," June 21, 2017",1,"Entertaining city-builder. I feel genuinely sorry for Mariina and Colossal Order, the developers.Why? Their publisher is now notorious for grotesquely unfair customer treatment. Please be aware of this (and future DLC after DLC after DLC to further fatten their greasy wallet)."
46,123.7,Recommended, March 18,1,"The most satisfactory city simulator i ever played. There is a lot of pros, like the details of each citizen, vehicle, building, etc. The form of energy production impacts in the mayor's (yours) image. The happiness, health, fire security, crime fight, education, each of them shape the development of the city, and the traffic... AHHH the traffic! It's so problematic to solve all the problems, a huge real puzzle. If u are a thinking person, just go for it and buy this game. I don't have all the DLCs, so i ll comment my personal vision of the game. It's not perfect. Can be improved, like more traffic tools (probably present at the MASS TRANSIT DLC) like speed limit control, time of each crossing street (if i have a intense car flux in one way, can setup the semaphores ll be helpful).Well, sorry my rusty english, but I thought my review ll reach more players if it is in english.Thanks for the developers for this gift called Cities: Skylines!!"
30,260.7,Recommended," November 18, 2017",1,"This is the true descendant to SimCity Series.All player can enjoy creative, arts, visual, mods and assets elements.But, I think production company Colossal Order requires more flexibility. What does that mean, most player uses many mods and assets. Especially some player uses or needs thousand of mods and assets. But, most player uses low-options computer. So, I think Colossal Order update many useful mods and assets in this game, and need optimizing. Then, Cities: Skylines will change everybody can enjoy game!! :)"
659,33.2,Recommended," August 15, 2016",1,I never played a city builder before this game. Said I would give it a shot.So much fun to play and to learn from your mistakes.It's a very easy game to get into but difficult to master as you can make it as complex as you want.The only limit to the building aspect is your own imagination.I would highly recommend it but be warned it is addictive.And support the Devs they're awesome.They made the masterpiece city builder that EA could not!

54,0.4,Recommended, March 19,1,"Requires a good pc, nice way to pass time"
91,553.5,Recommended, January 24,1,"The best city builder out there in my opinion. The main focus of the game is managing traffic and public transit systems though that really shouldn't be a surprise. Planning road layouts is essential, unless you'd rather have gridlock, and I suppose that can make or break the game for some people. If that sounds like something you would enjoy then this game is probably for you. I find coming up with creative solutions to solve traffic problems very satisfying myself, and of course I love building the ultimate skyline! So many good mods available on the workshop too if you like modding your games."
24,87.6,Not Recommended," September 18, 2017",7,"Cities: Skylines is an absolute broken, buggy mess with crashes, broken saves, update cycles breaking everything in sight, and all they care about is DLC after DLC. Summary: I WILL NOT recommend this game until the devs start to care about their own game by working on the core mechanics and features that should have been there in the first place."
33,117.6,Recommended," October 22, 2017",1,"This is my first review for a game, because I'm mostly lazy and would just rather play.. lol but if you're looking for an honest review then this would be one to read.This game is developed amazingly and I'm amazed how creative you can be in Cities Skylines. There isn't too much negative to talk about this game, the only thing that could come to mind is the traffic flow - but that's really just a matter of how you builld your road network. Another tip on traffic flow is consider changing up traffic patterns, switching different intersections, create roundabouts, etc. Roundabouts cause alot of confusion because not much people know how to properly use one. The AI in the game handles roundabouts pretty well if used in the right spots so keep that in mind.The steam workshop support is amazing and if you need any tools to help build your city and make you a successful city-builder, some tools created in the workshop definitely help you get the job done.I haven't played much other city-building type simulators, but I can guarantee that this would be one that is well worth the money. It may or may not be a little pricey depending on your budget, but the gameplay and endless possibilities is worth it. Every gameplay is different when loading into the game.. don't like how your city is doing? Wipe it out and begin another. Even on the same map you load, you can create new ideas on how you city wants to look. For new users - it will honestly be trial and error on how to plan your city. You are free and welcome to change it up however you see fit.I do recommend this game for numerous reasons and if you ever come across something that you feel is negative about the game.. I really don't believe it's an ice breaker by any means. It'll always be something you can work around and play around with. So for those that intend to purchase this game, good luck and happy building!"

I picked it up during the Steam sales for £7 (Deluxe Edition) and I'm certainly not regretting the purchase.I only feel that the game itself could be optimised a touch more just to get the most FPS possible, but overall, with all the steam workshop support, a truly astonishing game that I would reccomend to anyone and everyone!"

254,149.6,Recommended," May 30, 2015",1,"well, they just released a $30 DLC that adds tunnels and 50 new buildings, but the new buildings are only offered as exclusive content to players who pre-ordered the DLC. I was going to give a review on how the new tunnels work, but the game servers are crashing and overloaded because everyone is trying to play at once! Unfortunately it's got always-online DRM so the server issues (that can generally be reliably forecasted and predicted as this happens with any major game / DLC release) are preventing me from enjoying my single player experience. I guess the publisher and dev studio also told outright lies to their consumers regarding the necessity of the always-online requirement and absolutely none of this is true in fact I might be thinking of the wrong game entirely.10/10 would pay the full price of the failed predecessing competitor game to have my hopes and dreams utterly crushed, then pay the full price of Cities:Skylines to impossibly restore and rejuvinate my spirits in the rebound of the F%#&!*NG century."

339,34.2,Recommended," March 11, 2015",1,"From loving games such as Sim City and Roller coaster Tycoon I have been looking for a good city management game for some time. I can spend countless hours reworking roads to improve traffic flow and find laying water pips to be a peaceful experience. If that’s you, you might want to give this game a go.Unlike sim city, which it barrows heavily from there are no disasters. The biggest threat to your citizens will be fire. My few play throws the fire became a pain in how many burnt buildings I had to bulldoze. Though that was partly my fault I got rid of a street connecting the fire house. You could say the game was trying to bring my attention to this by burning the people of my city.City: Skylines is the definition of a city builder simulation game. Its goal is to give you the tools to create a prosperous city the way you see fit. Through a wonderful mechanic called districts I could regulate an industry heavy district to provide farm goods. Personally I like my cities to be eco-friendly and concentrate on resident happiness instead of trying to make the most profitable city I can.From years of playing these types of games, the fun comes from living the fantasy of running your own city your way. City: Skylines seems to understand this. From their UI and overall look of the game people will compare it to Sim City 2013. Though I think as time goes on people will start to point out how this game sets it self apart. You can only see this through playing it. It's a warm and welcoming feeling for people that want to dive into a city they can make into their own.This game also comes with a map and assets editor. From little I got to play with this feature I have to say its nice to create your own intersections to use in your maps. It keeps things uniform and saves you time from wasting cash and deleting unnecessary from roads that you have to replace, anyways.The developers have thought of steam workshop integrating from the get go. From seeing games of this type try to integrate other players into your game, like having a multiplayer function I much rather have this type of integration where players can add to each other's cities through making unique props, buildings and intersections.I would recommend this game to anyone that love city management games. It's one of the better ones."

Paradox does a great job of keeping things interesting by adding new veiws, maps, and tools.

427,81.0,Recommended," March 25, 2015",1,"Cities: Skylines is an amazing city builder. I haven't playes a Sim city game in a long time, admittedly, but Cities: Skylines really brings the genre to the forefront.The logic to this game is very good, where every peice of traffic or people actually has something to do, rather than just being cosmetic. This does make things a bit trickier, but overall that is much more fun. Similarly, the mechanics of district zoning is something I hadn't expected, but turns out to be really useful.Things do tend to get a bit hectic when you end up with a large population [>100,000], but that may just be due to my own lack of experience.The audio graphical design to this game are really good. It makes it a joy to just sink in to playing for hours. From a wide angle view of the environment, right down to the models of buildings and vehicles it all looks and sounds great. The interface isn't overly complex or cluttered, and it is easy to learn.The modding community to this game is amazing as well, with loads of great content. The devs are even taking hints from various popular mods and integrating relevant additions into the game itself, which is always nice to see. That, and the few gripes I do have about the game [like no tree brushes] can easily be fixed by a mod. They install easily, and I haven't had any game breakages from them.This game is definitely worth buyng if you like city builders, or simulator games of any kind."
52,226.2,Recommended, March 24,1,This game will eek its way into your dreams. Have you every dreamed about roads? You will dream about roads. Have you every really looked at that highyway intersection you drive by every day? You will also dream about highway intersections. Did you decide not to become a traffic engineer or city planner? You will decide to quit your job and become one. That's how awesome this game is.
2,443.4,Recommended, March 12,1,"A nice successor to SimCity.I have been playing this game on and off for months and I can say it is addictive if you played SimCity (and its many variations) when you were a kid. Plan everything from basic infrastructure and all sorts of buildings for your city in the asset editor. If you are like me and cannot build something without rage quitting (LOL), there are a LOT of mods and assets in the workshop to customize the look of your city. The game is pretty resource-intensive so I would not recoomend playing it with a plain PC (at least you need a dedicated video card)."
