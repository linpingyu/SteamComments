81,207.2,Recommended," June 24, 2017",11,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWPUBG is the type of game where it starts off with not caring too much if you die in the first few minutes (approx 90 players alive), after a little while and some reasonable loot and gear has been found, you would prefer not to die at this point but still not too fussed if you die (approx 60-70 players alive). After the 3rd/4th blue circle,You start to believe that you can achieve the impossible...you could possibly win...you'll taste the sweet fruits of victory...(10 players remaining)...you've made it to top 10....but you still want more....no more mistakes or joking around now...you're close....(last 2 players)...you believe in this...you can win! But alas...you make an idiotic mistake. You end as #2.....that moment will haunt you forever...This is what will happen every game, you'll feel rage, anger and above all serenity when you die because you know that the game is over....until you start the next one.Welcome to the battleground."
147,60.3,Not Recommended, January 2,3,"the chinese have 3 servers to choose from but they decide to go to OC and NA servers, mind doing something about that?Edit:OC is the worst, its the closest to their country so thats their first option, i have only found one group of australians in a test of 30 squad battles. This is absolutely ridiculous. But I guess the devs are more interested in making money off crates than actually listening to the thousands of outraged fansEdit 2:Not to mention the fact that the game runs horribly for a simple shooter game that had months of alpha and beta testing. You would think by 1.0 (the FULL RELEASE) that they wouldve at least fixed the optimization problem, let alone the Chinese issue. Until these major issues are fixed i will not be playing the game, and maybe getting people to stop playing the game will hopefully make the devs realise that people dont like the current state of the game, and that their game is at risk of losing a lot of players. Because right now they only care for money and more players, they have no idea how to appeal to their players wishes and make an actual enjoyable game, not just a money making machine."

191,721.1,Not Recommended, January 7,79,This game was soo fun at the start getting our first Chicken Dinner was amazing until patch 1.0 came out though almost every round we play we loot find good stuff fast and kill a few at the start.Then late game die to a hacker who will shoot through two buildings with a SKS with a 8x scope full autoing headshot it's a load of garbage don't buy this game anymore until they fix the major hacking problem they have within it.
248,789.9,Not Recommended, February 17,1,"Having played this game for almost a year, and more than 700 hours, I can't lie -- it's an addictive game. ""just one more round"" -- next thing I know it's 3AM. The only saving grace is that my wife plays with me, and sometimes without me :). Ere go, I get away with playing a lot.That said, I am writing off playing third person. The cheating is SO blatant, SO regular, and SO poorly handled, and with today's release from BattleEye that 99% of the cheaters are from one specific country, it isn't even fun any more. I reject the comments from the developers that we shouldn't be ""racist."" I like all people...who play by the rules. I don't mind getting creamed, as long as it's legitimate. I don't even check the names any more to see who killed me, though I still report them. I receive ZERO feedback that my report actually resulted in a ban, and since the cheating continues, even if they did get banned, so what? It hasn't improved.What I don't like is ineffective action by the developers. Regular updates about how many thousands of accounts banned, except that somehow, cheaters have monetized the loot in this game, so for every account that gets banned, another gets purchased, AKA a regular income stream for Blue Hole. I will continue to play, but in First Person only -- and that does separate me from some of my regular team-mates. Blue Hole knows what needs to be done, and they have been told LOUD AND CLEAR -- Region Lock China and prevent high pings from playing. I will continue to play, until FPP gets infected with cheaters, and then I will hang up my headset on this game for good. I cannot, however, recommend this game in third person -- at all."

54,281.4,Not Recommended, February 7,4,"PUBG is what you get when amateur developers have a good idea for what could be a great game, with a small budget to start with. Now that they've made many millions (close to a billion on PC sales alone) all they see is money. They no longer care about player experience. Why spend money to make the game better when most of the people that would buy the game have already bought it?Mistakes / poor decisions:- First mistake was the game engine that they built the game on. It wasn't designed for 100 players, so they had to reduce the server tickrate to ridiculously low rates. There are better engines that can handle 100 players, but I guess they went with the cheaper solution.- Client side hit detection. This is why you can still get shot after you get into cover. Players with high ping have a big advantage over players with low ping.- No region lock or ping lock. They talked about implementing this months ago, but now you're racist or ""xenophobic"" toward Chinese people if you want this feature. Setting a max ping or locking players to their region would reduce the poor experience of having client side hit detection.- Lootboxes. Everything about them. Some items like the school girl outfit sell for over $1k on the marketplace. Huge incentive for cheaters, since you get points for kills and wins to buy these loot boxes with. They also just came out with locked lootboxes, so you play to get your points to get the rewards, and then you have to pay $3 to open the box or sell the box for around 25 cents (current price on the marketplace).- Not really banning cheaters. Most cheaters sell all the items they get from their lootboxes, Bluehole gets a cut of every sale. Then they ban the cheater but allow them to just buy the game again to keep playing/cheating/selling, and the cycle continues. Bluehole makes money every step of the way, so why would they change this? They make way more money from a cheater than they do from a regular player.- STEREO sound... what year is this??- Some ""minor"" issues with game design that could be easily fixed, like making bullets come from your gun instead of your chest, slowing the circles down a bit, etc. But compared to the above points, these are pretty minor.- Engine that can handle 100 players with a decent tickrate.- Server side hit detection (only works well with a good server tickrate).- Actually ban cheaters (IP, MAC address, etc.). I know there are ways around it, but it's not as easy as just buying another copy of the game.- Sell rare items, like the schoolgirl uniform for example. Lots of people like being able to sell/trade things on the marketplace, so keep that if you must, but if Bluehole sold items themselves (even just the rare items), it would control the prices and make cheating less lucrative. If they sold the schoolgirl outfit for like $50, they would make millions. Win-win for everyone.If they had their own store for selling cosmetic items, they would have a steady income stream from people that own the game, and they wouldn't care as much about the steady income from banning cheaters and having them buy the game again. It would also give them incentive to improve the game to keep people playing and buying stuff.- Bluehole can take these Desperado crates and shove them up their♥♥♥♥♥ I will never buy a key to open one, and I won't sell them on the marketplace so that they can make more money. Using points I earned to get a crate that I have to pay to open is not a reward, greedy♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥- Region / Ping lock. There are servers in every major region, why do people need to play on a server that's on the other side of the world? If the game had server side hit detection, having a higher ping would be a disadvantage so it wouldn't be as big of an issue.- Surround sound. Good positional audio is important in any FPS.If they made these changes, I would recommend this game... but we're more likely to see a better studio make a better game before any of this happens.It's exciting, really gets the adrenaline pumping. You start with nothing and there's no respawn, so everything you do matters, and every decision you make can win or lose the round for you - where to drop, what to loot, how long to spend looting, where to go, when to go there, when to fight, when to flee, etc. Randomness of loot and circles makes those decisions and each round a little different. Option to go solo, duo, or squads, each mode changing the way you play the game.All of this makes for a fun and addicting game.. until you die to a cheater, or someone with high ping killing you after you get into cover (or they came around the corner and saw you before you could see them), or not being able to hit the guy outside your building because your bullets are coming out of your chest and hitting the window-sill, etc.The most frustrating thing about all that, is that Bluehole is not doing enough to fix it. The only punishment for cheaters is having to buy another copy of the game, how greedy can you get? They don't want to region/ping lock because they don't want to offend the Chinese, and they make a lot of money from them, especially since a large majority of the cheaters are from China. That's not racism, that's fact.There are several Chinese players in every round on NA servers, many of them are cheaters, some of them are just there to get away from the asian servers that are full of cheaters, but they still have an advantage due to their high ping. 0.05% of them are there to play with their friends in NA, and that's the main reason Bluehole said they don't want to region/ping lock. In squads and duo's where communication is very important, it really sucks to get teamed up with someone that can only speak enough english to say ""China numba wun"".Greed and incompetence ruined what could have been an awesome game. This just seems to be a very short-sighted money grab, when it could easily be a long term revenue stream.To those that say ""engine can handle 100 players look at fortnite"", the tickrate (server update frequency) is still far lower than optimal in both games. Games like BF1, CS:GO, COD, etc, run server tickrates of 60Hz or higher. H1Z1 on the Forgelight engine (made for a larger number of players) runs a server tickrate of 76Hz. Tickrate isn't everything, but it's a big part of the network delay between two players, and low tickrates can cause other issues.PUBG is actually up to 30Hz now, but not until over half the people are dead. Fortnite maxes out at 20Hz when there are less than 50 players. Both games start at around 8-10Hz with everyone alive, and that increases as players die, which shows the engine can't properly handle 100 players in either game.Fortnite has better devs, same company that made the game also built the engine, so yes they are better at making it work. That doesn't change the fact that the tickrate is reduced until there are 50 players or less left alive. If it could ""easily handle 100 players"" the tickrate would run at the set 20Hz with 100 people alive.Recent tests:Netcode 101:"

179,429.4,Not Recommended, January 4,3,"It starts off incredibly fun at first, and will give you an insane rush in your first few matches. Winning your first match is a feeling that few things can compare too. But I'm going to tell you now, once the honeymoon phase wears off, this game QUICKLY stops being fun and you'll begin to notice just how awful the quality of it is.- The netcode in this game is absolutely atrocious, and is hugely abusable for players with a high ping. The extremely low tickrate and insane desync that results from it means that you're constantly dying around corners a full second after taking cover - or worse, dumping half a magazine of full-auto assault rifle into someone as soon as they come around a corner, only to get onetapped by them mid-spray because they'd already come around the corner and shot you dead on their end two seconds ago, before you even saw them start moving on your end. No ping cap or region lock means players can queue for matches on servers halfway across the world and instantly get an insane amount of peeker's advantage.- There's a huge cheater population in the game that has been there ever since PUBG started getting popular. Aimbot, wallhacks, recoil scripts, teaming in solo matches, the list goes on. Battleeye does next to nothing to stop this.- There are still bugs galore that need to be fixed, some of which have been in the game since alpha. Randomly dying from fall damage just because you brushed up against the wrong wall/object, vehicles glitching into walls or flying into the stratosphere from the slightest collision (admittedly hilarious but still in need of fixing), hit registration being complete garbage - there's just too many to list here.But in their infinite wisdom, Bluehole decided to let all this go through to the 1.0 release instead of actually making the game a release-ready product, likely for Christmas sales.TL;DR: Don't get this game until it's actually in a release-ready state, if it ever gets there."

I don't watch or follow streamers and can't see the point in doing that instead of actually playing the game. This is a matter of principle - if you're in the game broadcasting your position to the whole world, you should be ready and willing to deal with the consequences of doing that. And while the streamers get pampered, cheating is completely out of control.What worries me the most is that Brendan Greene (aka PLAYERUNKNOWN) seems to be a fan of Microsoft and their ""software as a service"" business model, which already spawned abominations like Cancer 10[www.grc.com]. Thus the lack of plans for Linux and Mac OS X ports and for Vulkan support. I'm pretty sure they have DirectX 12 support planned though and eventually the game might become only, which would be a real shame.with the 14 September 2017 update, the devs decided to go all Microsoft and removed some of the players' choices. The Shadows setting is now being ignored, and a high level of shadows is being forced on all players, together with ambient occlusion, bloom and depth of field. All the bugs reported on by people who played on the test servers before the update was deployed to the main servers were solemnly ignored, making me wonder what's the point in having test servers at all.one of their ""community managers"" posted an ""explanation"" referring to on reddit instead of on their official forums where the topic was created, so I posted on their official forums that doing that was amateurish of him. A few minutes later, I was summarily banned from their official forums without any previous warning by a moderator going by the nick . And to think that I've been helping to promote this game on all the sites and community channels since it was launched...So, when you post on the PUBG official forums, be extremely careful not to write anything the hypersensitive, touchy-feely ""community managers"" and moderators might find even slightly offensive to them, or you will be banned without warning and with no chance to appeal the ban.on 20 December 2017 the game officially left early access state, and I gotta give the devs some credit for having had the courage to release this... thing. They actually managed to make the game look and play and sound worse than the early access version. All textures have been downfiltered and the color palette reduced. Chromatic aberration also seems to have been applied, together with color oversaturation. I would say that, once they admitted to themselves that they were unable to increase the game's performance, they decided to partially achieve that by downgrading the quality of the graphics. And the water... what have they done to the water?!?!? Was it really their intention to make it look like an oil spillage happened?Now on to the new ""desert"" map (AKA Miramar). It's hard to find words to describe that abomination. While every spot on Erangel had some kind of ""point"" to it, with different strategies needed depending on where you decided to land, the new map would probably have been better if they had let a program generate it by randomly placing groups of buildings and hills across the map - because that's what it is, a pointless mess of pointless spots, plagued by even worse graphics than Erangel, with horribly overbright low-quality textures covering the whole thing.Any FPS game from the mid 2000's looks and plays and sounds way better than this. I laughed a lot with my friends because some of the new vehicle sounds actually reminded us of someone having sexual intercourse. The bombing sounds are equally laughably inconsistent. I really tried hard to find some redeeming quality to this release but it's so bad and annoying in so many ways that I'm not even feeling like playing the game anymore.with the release of the new crates on 22 February 2018, I decided today to check out the state the game was in. I only have one word to describe it: . They managed to make the graphics and the maps even uglier - even the once glorious Erangel is now hard to look at without my stomach churning. For some reason they decided to shrink the fonts and the game's items, making text harder to read and items harder to pick up. The game's items were also reskinned and look much worse now, as does most everything else. But the icing on this rotten cake is the new ""sliding feature"". It works like this: when you stop moving, you continue to slide in the direction you were moving for a while. That makes you miss turns, items and enemies all the time. The only reason I can possibly imagine for someone to play the game the way it is now is to get the crates and sell them on the communiry market."

However, there are two things are that holding this game back. The streamers and the developers. Arguably, the streamers are the ones that made this game famous but as of right now, they are ruining it with the help of the developers.""There are two rules for success... Number one, never reveal everything you know.""The Streamer. These are the people who cry and whine about stream sniping. I have to be completely honest, I feel sorry for these guys... If you're going to complain about stream snipers then whine to the developers otherwise you're not going to play their game anymore, you need to shut up and get out. The laziness and the ""♥♥♥♥ YOU, GIVE ME MONEY!"" attitude from the streamers disgust me the most. They could easily put up a delay, blur out information, and block out the map... they choose not to. Instead, this is where the devs come into play...With very little to no proof at all, they will ban you outright because a streamer cried stream sniper. In fact, the devs don't even need proof, the streamers' tears and butthurt emotions show all the proof that he's a salty loser. You guys need to listen to the real community, the Steam reviews, the people on Reddit. Not to the dumbasses who stream and cry ""STREAM SNIPER, BAN HIM!"" whenever they get salty about being killed. At this point, there are possibly more innocent people banned than actual stream snipers.

324,154.6,Not Recommended," August 4, 2017",39,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWAs much as I like this game and the whole concept of battle royale game mode is really intresting I think PUBG really did a good job of bringing out the feeling of the battle royale. Basically placing 100 players into 1 world and letting us killing each other to win either with a team of 4 or duo or solo. But then I just can't recommend this game because of its various problems and how the developers is treating the player base.First off I will not really blame them for the server issues because handling 1 million plus players does offer some challenges etc but slapping ADS into a game to buy a third party software just to ""boost"" their connectivity to their game servers is kind of ♥♥♥♥ed up seriously like wow, they too paid a premium for the game but why is it that after paying for the game they still have to get a third party software to ""boost"" their connectivity to the game servers? isn't the devs of PUBG themselves should take the responsibility and say ""Okay we need more servers for the chinese players""?Looks really good am I right? Looks very interesting, so much intense fighting and feels thrilling. Well sadly the game trailer is just full of♥♥♥♥♥♥ The trailer is what you would call glitter over a game. Those fights you seen in the trailer out of 100 games you will probably will only ever experience those fights in like 1 out of your 100 games or totally none at all. Those fight rarely occurs because RNG ♥♥♥♥s you over or you will be running for half the game from the blue circle just to be killed be some cheater later on. To put it simply the trailer is just a cool montage to make the game look good.DO NOT BE FOOLED BY THE GAME TRAILER.It is really bad. I can run the game smoothly at 60FPS but the rendering of textures in this game is just horrible. I won't even say much for this because it is just obvious when you play the game.If you are wondering what I am running with for this game. It is not the best but I am pretty surely this can run it at a much better rate- ProcessorIntel(R) Core(TM) i5-7500 CPU @ 3.40GHz- Video CardNVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070- RAM16 GB- Operating SystemMicrosoft Windows 10 (build 15063), 64-bitYes I know it is only for cosmetic purposes and it will not affect the gameplay at all. [ For those people who will say ""hey but its only cosmetics"" ]Adding microtransactions means adding microtransactions and them going back on their word there is no other way around. It is like a lie is a lie no other way around it.So what this means? In the future anything they promise us like lets say a free new map for example. They can easily go back on their word anytime and say that the new map they promised us to be free will be sold as a DLC :D I mean why not right? They went back on their word on microtransactions and it is so blatant, this means that the Devs dare to go back on their word without fear. Oh not to mention the game is still in EARLY ACCESS filled with a alot of bugs.Oh yes early access with loot crates. Whats next? Needing to open lootcrates to get keys to open other lootcrates? Well if it really comes from this game I won't be surprised at all.In this game it is so hard to get first place basically winning and the cheaters is getting extremely out of hand. Aside from fighting other 95 + other players you still have to deal with cheaters!! In the early stages there weren't many cheaters but after some time they grew and there seem to be nothing has been done to put a stop to them. Right now literally every game there is usually 1 cheater lurking just having extreme speed [ The most common I see so far that is obvious ] or just ""aimbotting"". Just goto youtube and search you can see lots of them.Was in a team of 4, 1 dead and 3 was alive and 3V1. Me and 2 other friends was alive. [ Note my team was all at 80% HP ]I was downed by a burst fire from far range [ 4 shots from AKM downed me instantly ] But managed to get revived. I found it very suspicious but i doubted there was a cheater. People do hit lucky shots once in a while.But this is where things gets very obvious. Final circle came and then the opponent just killed all 3 of us in an instant and all of us were behind cover. And game over just like that.You can say oh we are just bad it is up to you to think what you want but lets be real here you will know someone is cheating when somthing so stupid happens like in my case all 3 of us dies behind cover at the same time instantly. Like if I were to die when peeking ok the opponent may be just be very skiled but no all 3 of us were behind cover.For those who still says you have not encountered cheaters, well good for you but play the game more and you will encounter them sonner or later.Just plain disappointed and disgusted at its practices in this game and how the player base is getting treated."

Upon review of the kill cam, they are tracking us through walls and snapping straight to where we are even when there is no possible way they knew where we were that fast!

522,46.0,Recommended," May 27, 2017",1,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWIntroductionPLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS (PUBG) is a battle-royale, 100-players, open-world MMOFPS/TPS set on a massive 8x8km land. The game supports solo, duo, and squad (3-4 ppl) play. Gameplay is very straightforward, you hop off a plane, loot weapons, armors, and equipments from buildings, and survive the thrilling PvP bloodbath.PUBG is obviously not the first massive battle-royale game out there, yet it stands on the pinnacle of its genre. As you may have known, PUBG has had a highly successful launch, securing a place on Steam's Top Seller game. If you're looking for a good battle-royale PvP, look no further. You've struck the gold.My claim is not without reason. The following is PUBG's pros and cons in my opinion:Pros1. Extremely active and communicative developers. This is vital for an early access game. PUBG is being constantly updated every month. I would speculate that this is one of the major factors in PUBG's success. Other battle-royale PvP games are mostly in Early-Alpha for years and their devs are too focused on gathering as much money as they can from the current players without making any real development progress on the game - PUBG is exactly the opposite.2. Great gameplay concept. No pay-to-win and no grind-to-win. Apparels are only cosmetics. The only thing you keep from playing PUBG is your skill. The PvP is thrilling and definitely fun to play with your friends.3. Non-toxic community. Simply because there is no chat function. Switch your voice channel to team-only and you're good to go. I wouldn't recommend teaming up with strangers because of obvious reasons.4. Highly demanding on teamwork and strategy. You can't just hop off the plane and recklessly run around the map no-scoping bozos. You have to plan out your movement very carefully and quickly since time is of the essence. Difficult decisions comes up often, especially in squad play (e.g. risk your life to revive your mate or run like hell to safety; Kill someone and give out your position to nearby players or stay quiet; Deciding your next 'safe spot', etc.) An enjoyable learning curve definitely exists - not too steep and not too lean.5. A shooting game that applies semi-realistic weapon recoil, bullet travel time, and bullet drop is always appreciated.6. Various vehicles, weapons, weapon mods, clothings, and equipments are scattered all over the battleground to aid you in your quest of survival. The weapon stats variety amps up the gameplay - It can be quite a challenge to engage in a firefight when you got the wrong weapon for the situation.7. Although FPS is not recommended due to limited POV, the game supports both FPS and TPS.8. Minor performance improvements can get quite noticeable after several updates. Devs truly are working on the optimization issue. We can look forward towards better performance in the future.1. Currently, very performance-demanding. The game isn't optimized that well yet and runs on very unstable fps even on high-end rigs. The minimum 6 gigs of RAM is an absolute minimum - virtual RAMs can't help your 4-gigs-RAM PC. In terms of GPU, one of my friends that is using a GTX980 is suffering from <30fps and extremely slow loading progress. Another friend with a GTX1060 suffers from fps drops during rain/smoke.As a response to comments' feedback for my 1st cons list: The game is still playable on all those mentioned GPUs. I just want you to know that the game is not optimized well. FPS drops, crashes, and screen freeze will sometimes happen even on high-end rigs. It happens randomly - I don't measure the frequency.2. Server is lagging badly due to high player base. I would speculate devs didn't expect a huge sale boom and didn't have the resources to support all the players. As an example, you were running to cover when under enemy fire. You already reached the cover, but 2 seconds later, blood spurts out of your chest, you fell down to the ground gasping for air as your vision starts to blur. You scream for your squadmate to magically heal your bullet wound by rubbing the grass around you, but then...okay you get my point3. Gameplay is monotonous. Similar to CSGO's Competitive and Dota 2, you only have one type of game. The unique experience relies on various encounters with the squad/enemy in-game.4. Melee weapons are terribly inaccurate. Aiming also can be a bit off sometimes. Possibly caused by the server lag.5. Controls are terribly not reactive. It takes some miliseconds for the game to recognize LMB/RMB/'Use' command. Or even failing to recognize the commands at all. It can take three, four RMBs to activate the scope. It's kind of annoying when the weapon refuses to shoot when I press LMB because of the input recognition lag. This is a vital issue for a PvP game - devs better fix this quickly.As a response to the comments' feedback: I have to add that my statement about the terrible control is a rare occasion. Generally, 1, or 2 key inputs would be recognized. I would say having to press twice is much more common than 3/4 times like I said. But it does often take some miliseconds for the inputs to be recognized. My point is still valid: The controls are NOT reactive - horrible for a PvP game.6. Vehicles flips too easily and difficult/too unrealistic to drive7. Door and movement bugs seem to be quite prevalent lately. Whenever I move a step ahead, the game throws me back 3, 4 steps backwards. Seems to be affecting the entire server whenever it happens. Invisible doors also prevent players from entering a building, throwing us outdoors whenever we try to enter a building. Similar to fps spikes, these happen randomly.Don't lose all hopes because of my cons list - remember that this is an early access game. I know some of the cons can be too much to handle and disturbs the gameplay, but devs are very active in updating the game. I dare to conclude that PUBG is currently the best battle-royale MMOFPS/TPS PvP game out there. The current state of the game is more than playable. Definitely worth purchasing even when it's not on sale.Well that's all I have to say about PUBG. Hope it can be of help to potential buyers!UPDATE: Never expected my review would go up top on Most Helpful for this game. So I've decided to take down this review after having more playtime hours. I'll update it if there're any significant changes.UPDATE 2: This review was made before the era of the 'stream sniping' and the microtransaction drama. I haven't played the game for a while so I lack proper first-hand experience to update my review. With that said, keep in mind that this review is outdated."

114,272.1,Not Recommended, January 29,61,"TL;DR - I cannot in good conscience recommend this game to anyone so long as the developers refuse to take any real action against the game ruining cheats that are running rampant throughout their game. If I could return the game at this point I would. I hate that I have given money to a company that cares so little about their fanbase. - TL;DRI've got quite a few hours in this game, not enough to be a no-life but enough to know how it is. Let me break some things down for you about this game.It's almost unplayable. The sheer number of cheaters (literally almost all if not all are from China) has been growing steadily for over a month. Ever since more and more Chinese players have migrated to the North American servers the population of cheaters has skyrocketed. Allow me to list what will happen to you regularly:- You will join a lobby and all you will hear is a dozen plus voices shouting in Chinese with the occasion expletive in English.- You will drop and find supplies as normal- You will run in to a solo/group/duo/etc. as expected- Instead of banter during the firefight all you hear is shrieking and yelling in Chinese (They talk in-game A LOT for some reason)- You will be instantly shot in the head after you leave cover (often before too) by somebody who was 100 meters+ away and was not even aiming down their sights, just hip firing.- You will be angry that you were killed by a cheater- You will take a break for a few minutes- You will go back to the top of this list.Literally of the last 5 games I have played 4 of my 5 deaths have been to Chinese who were cheating on the North American servers. I will tell the story of the last death.Partner and I were on a rooftop picking up a couple items, I see two players brazenly jogging down the middle of the road, one not wearing pants (A telltale sign it is a Chinese player), and tell my partner to get ready to attack them. At this point we have not at any point crested the barrier between us, but the enemy player in front of the duo has been looking directly at my position on a roof in the middle of town the whole way down the road. I told my partner to shoot and within a half second of him standing and taking his first shot he was knocked on the ground, I had also stood up when I said to shoot and I was on the ground almost instantly after my partner. Watching the death cam revealed the instant we both stood up the same player headshot both of us, while running, while firing from the hip. Their target reticule was as large as it could possibly be, yet they managed to hit both of us in the head twice in less than a second at 50 meters while moving and not aiming.You could think it was a wildly lucky shot, but when the same scenario has happened twice before tonight alone, it isn't coincidence that all the players doing this magical shots are all Chinese and assuredly cheating.I'm not bad at the game, I have multiple wins under my belt, I know what a good player acts like, and none of the Chinese players who kill me act like that.The game is broken. Not because of in-game glitches or errors (of which there are more than a few, freezing on start is a big one) but because there are hundreds of thousands of cheaters, literally. The developers of the game have openly admitted that a vast majority of the cheating players are Chinese, but sternly refuse to region lock the game and keep the Chinese players on the Chinese servers. They claim it is ""unfair"" to keep the ""good players"" out because of ""a few bad eggs"" However a ""few bad eggs"" is the majority of over 1,500,000 banned cheaters. It is more unfair to the few Chinese players that do not cheat to be forced to play with all their cheating brethren than it is to the entirety of the EU, NA, SA, SEA, etc. communities and players, who are all burdened by the massive influx of cheaters from a single region.I cannot in good conscience recommend this game to anyone so long as the developers refuse to take any real action against the game ruining cheats that are running rampant throughout their game. If I could return the game at this point I would. I hate that I have given money to a company that cares so little about their fanbase."
232,112.3,Not Recommended," August 17, 2017",9,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWThis game is incredibly enjoyable, exciting and gets my adrenaline rushing like nothing I've ever played....BUT, until the devs stop banning people because streamers say they were ""harassed"", I'm giving it a thumbs down.Devs, honking a horn is NOT harassment. Explain to me how that effects someones stream or is harassment? Kill the person if they're doing that, and if they're in your squad, don't play with that person again (DUH). Also, when you're constantly being thrown into random servers, the odds of actually ""stream sniping"" someone is virtually impossible. This isn't like other games where you can find the server name and follow the streamer into it. Who the hell made this decision?Also, the broken promise regarding microtransactions. That is pretty goddamn shady. That's bad enough, but when there are so many glaring areas that need work, ignoring all of that to add a feature you said you wouldn't add until release is a straight kick in the nuts to your supporters.Devs, don't forget: We made you successful, and we can undo that by choosing not to buy anymore games from someone who isn't trustworthy, and thinks prioritizing streaming to the point of BANNING legitimate players who may not even be aware the other person is streaming is INSANITY. Whoever made this decision needs to be FIRED.You guys have created a PR nightmare for yourself and until you make it right it's only going to get worse. It's like you started out with a row boat and now you're flying around in a Yacht. Except now you decided to blow a hole in the bottom of the yacht, allowing it to take on water (which will inevitably sink it), but you choose to pretend the hole isn't there and that you didn't make it. GET BACK TO REALITY.Actual hacks deserve a ban, not because someone did something that some sniveling streamer didn't like."

Based upon the limited available evidence, it appears a Chinese company Tencent has bought a 5% stake in the game to allow it to be sold in China, and are creating and selling the hacks on the backend. So basically the developer is in cahoots with the hack devs. Tencent's stake purchases also coincides perfectly with the meteoric explosion in concurrent players on steam stats.While it seemed for sometime the devs actually cared about bringing the game to completion, it appears this game will go the way of its predecessors Dayz, Warz, and H1Z1 into irrelevancy."

Then he focused on bringing microransactions in the game, then bringing in game adds we have to look at, even tought everyone of us payed for the game. 2 gigabit ""patch"" to introduce advertisements in game - Intel yey !!! You got to be kidding me!!!And now Glass Door is focused on getting the game out of Beta so he can cash on his contract with microsoft. microsoft wants the game on console and that's another pile of money for the taking, no matter hackers are running amok and players are begging for help.The cherry on top is B.Hole banning people for honking near streamers or god forbid if you kill them. Yet in the statistics the top players all with numbers or chinese names have 80 kill/ death ratio but thats no problem!

317,219.0,Not Recommended, January 4,22,"I've been playing PUBG since i got a key from my favorite small time streamer back in the closed beta days, and back then i had such high hopes. After playing countless hours of H1Z1, The Culling, and Arma3 Battle Royale, i could tell that PUBG was headed in the right direction with a lot of potential. And oh how i was woefully wrong. I've played countless hours of PUBG, and over time, my excitement dwindled and i got slowly more and more fed up with all of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Nowadays it's pretty difficult for me to enjoy the game at all, after all of the faith i initially put into the concept and the designers.For my experience, i tend to not pay attention to hackers, and i never got banned for false stream sniper accusations, so my opinion i'm expressing here is purely on game design and execution. However, it's worth looking into the way the devs have handled PR and hackers, but i won't go into it. My main issues are with the bland and tired game design choices that the devs keep making after their player base clearly voicing their lack of appreciation for it.1. The graphical fidelity tied to performance. Or lack thereof. Now, granted this problem has been addressed pretty well with full release, before then, the game either looked like♥♥♥♥♥or ran like♥♥♥♥♥ and there was zero inbetween. Even with full release, it still has to look pretty sub-par for our generation of systems to run as well as a battle royale shooter should.2. The gunplay. I've been pretty spoiled by Escape From Tarkov in terms of gunplay recently, but I also have too many hours across the various Arma titles, and i love my guns irl, and PUBG's gunplay is atrocious in comparison. Bullets travel at a painfully slow speed to where you have to pretend you're shooting BB guns at people leading four or five body lengths ahead someone running normal to you at 25m away.2.5 The hit registration/player-to-player sync is pretty damn bad. This also segways into point 3. but you'll watch your little tracer rounds travel through people's helmets while they're standing still and get no hint of a successful hit, or you'll light someone up 15 feet in front of you and watch them turn into a red mist and they'll turn around and drop you in one or two shots. It's all just super sloppy feeling, like you're constantly gambling with bad servers and chinese players with 500 ping.3. Horrendous servers. This is an issue that if anything has gotten worse since full release. The first 5 minutes or so of landing into the map is just rubber banding, waiting 5-15 seconds to collect things off of the ground, getting shot around corners that you turned several seconds prior, and some of the jankiest gunfights you will ever see in a $40 or whatever it costs nowadays game. You'll get shot around cover pretty consistently throughout the game, you'll watch your bullets phase through people running in a straight line, and there will be the occasional Corvo inspired blink man who can get from point A to point B by teleporting up stairs or around tight corners to instantly drop you because the servers can't be f***ed to keep up.-quick sidenote here, my friend and I got really into duos for a stretch, and we won a lot, so these complaints are not coming from someone just salty about losing. We were pretty good, i'm just tired of putting up w/ these painful issues to keep playing this game.4. The movement. I think it's the way the game manages player acceleration that makes it feel so bad, but it feels like you're constantly fighting the game to get your character to move how you want. Vaulting was definitely a necessary addition, and i think it was done pretty well, but oh man is the rest of the movement bad. A directional input from the player takes about a second or two for the character to get up to speed, and turning and jumping are directly tied to your current momentum, so it just feels like you have very little tight control of your character. Arma2 has better movement mechanics imo, and if you play Arma2, you know that says a lot.1. Battle Royale is fun. BR game modes are tense, exciting, and rewarding, and as much of a shame as it is, PUBG is really the only healthy BR game right now.2. Sound design. Using sound to hone in on players or gunshots is not hard w/ a decent soundscape, and gunshots sound good. The actual gun's blast, the bullet's snap, and the report are all usually distinguishable and they add to the experience. Sometimes suppressors can make guns completely inaudible over the snap or the report, but so be it. Also suppressed shots generally sound very good within audible range.Compared to other battle royale games of the past: The Culling (in its first couple of combat iterations where it was genuinely a blast), H1Z1 (although it had its own slew of problems, it was fast paced, tight, and fun), and Arma3 BR (truly the peak of the BR genre IMO, but sadly arma is just not accessible enough to hold peoples' interest or collect a strong enough playerbase or audience), PUBG just doesn't meet some pretty easy standards of quality in my opinion, and i think people just don't know better than to just accept it for the only BR title to play and support atm. It's got some relatively bad network performance, only recently does it have decent clientside performance, it has inconsistent and frustrating gunplay, janky and loose movement that does not compliment a game of this style or intended pace, and it above all else just feels like it's going to be a forever Early Access title that was lost to a big publisher more interested in generating money and twitch/youtube stardom than developing a high quality game appreciated for anything more than the base concept of Battle Royale alone."

As you can see from my hours played, I do enjoy the core game experience of a battle royale with semi-realistic mechanics. However, the developer is working very hard on ruining the experience by creating 3 classes of customers: the ALMIGHTY STREAMER, who allegedly can get players banned by his word alone. The FOOL, who pays real money to unlock crates to get clothing items. And finally, the PLEB PLAYER, who is at the butt of the joke.Before we get into the 3 classes of customers, what is this about? Well, the developer made 3 relevant statements:turned out to be a lie as there were microtransactions in EA with the Gamescom crate and all the clothes are on the Steam marketplace now.is nonsense to me as there are clearly clothing items that are better at camo than others. Visibility is just cosmetic in a game like pubg. See video above.means that you won't be able to collect a camo-esque outfit after EA for free. You will be forced to pay money for it. You could also find a camo-esque piece of clothing in a match, but it's pretty obvious that someone who starts with a full camo outfit will be at an advantage over someone who has to be lucky and find all the parts in a match.Now let's look at the ALMIGHTY STREAMER:Let's look at the FOOL:Let's look at the PLEB PLAYER:You will die or find yourself at a disadvantage caused by a bug, bad performance or lag at least once per play session - but if you play this as a lighthearted romp, the derpy state of the game might actually add to the fun. How the dev can perceive his game as ""e-sports ready"" in this state is a mystery though. Same goes for the microtransactions and streamer drama.That's why I'd recommend the buggy broken game from a few weeks ago before they added paid crates, but cannot recommend the buggy game that wants to be an e-sport with a p2w lottery crate system."

261,223.8,Not Recommended, February 21,609,"So after nearly 200 hours of gameplay, and a multitude of ups and downs in this game. I finally decided to collect my thoughts and share them here.PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS (Henceforth known as Pubg) is a battle royale shooter, similar to ArmA 2/3 BR and H1Z1. The concept is simple, 100 players drop out of a plane over an island or a Trump-Wallesque desert, scrounge up the best gear they can find, and kill each other. Last man/woman standing wins, but you don't really need to hear that, the game has been out for nearly a year, and if you haven't heard of Pubg by now, then I don't even know anymore.Pubg does a lot of things right. The gunplay, when it works correctly, is phenomenal. It feels tight and responsive, the bullet physics feel accurate, and especially rewarding when landing long range shots. This is arguably it's strongest suit.The original map that the game launched with 'Erangel' is a great mix of different terrains and hotspots allowing different routes to be taken in order to achieve victory, and is easily the stronger map of the two. The movement, for the most part is good. However I will touch on this a little later.Despite the multitude of things that Pubg gets right, it gets so much wrong. Hackers are a major problem in this game, even after the implementation of PUBG Corp's proprietary Anti-Cheat. Wallhackers, Aimbotters, Norecoil. Hackers are rampant in this game.Ping abuse is another problem. There is a reason you see people spamming #RegionLockChina, and it's not an attempt at racist humour. Not in the slightest. People from countries such as China, tend to join NA and EU servers in order to abuse the fact thaat the desync in this game causes them to be able to demolish people without any issue due to the fact that they are next to impossible to shoot, due to their high ping.Desync itself is still a major issue, with major rubberbanding, hit registration and a plethora of other issues still plaguing this game. A recent example of this would be when I unloaded 20 bullets from a Scar-L, point blank into an enemies chest, only for them to soak it up, turn around and drop me in two shots. The death cam registered three bullets hitting him. THREE. There was more than three blood sprays shooting from his body, so my client registered that bullets had hit, but the server did not. I was on an EU server, with 40 ping. This again ties in to my earlier point regarding movement. While the movement is pretty solid, the fact that the desync, coupled with the games rubberbanding issues are still present. Movement is more often than not a challenge. When your game struggles to handle something as basic as movement fluidly. We got a problem.These issues, while major, could be overlooked to a certain extent if the game remained in early access. This is where one of my main gripes remains. This is sold to the end user as a finished product. A game rampant with hackers, lag issues, server desync, and basic hit registration issues, is not only being sold as a full game, but is also touted as 'eSports ready'. A game in which the chances of you actually hitting someone seem all but randomized, is considered 'eSports ready'.However, none of my complaints matter at the end of the day. I bought the game, PUBG Corp/Bluehole made their money, and that's all that counts at the end of the day.Do I recommend this game? Sure, I guess I do, winning in this game is a sheer adrenaline rush. It's unlike any other game I've ever played.Do I think you should buy this game? No. Not until this is a stable product, that has a handle on the hackers, has fixed the issues with servers, and has restricted access from players from a high ping locale.TL:DR This game is good, but it's also trash. Play Fortnite instead, that actually works.EDIT: To those thinking that my comment about playing Fortnite was real, it wasn't. I was being facetious, if anything it's worse than pubg, considerably so. I was just making a joke about how bad PUBG can be. Chill with the salt boys."

The gameplay is fun, smooth, different and enjoyable. Feels almost like a brand new game. Thank god they added the deathcam so I can now at least feel validated when I am killed by a hacker. Still hacks on hacks, cannot recommend until they region lock.Edit 3: Still winning games. The new map is so fun, I am having a blast. Yet... Still. STILL.

However, still no region lock, still no server side hit detection, and still high ping desync issues. They have now made hundreds of millions of dollars but no long term solution in sight.Edit 5: Never have I played a game that has received this much money, support, and recognition from its player base. Never have I played a game that continually had issues with hackers, server stability and desync killings."

56,"1,319.9",Not Recommended, January 8,23,"Before I begin, I'd like you all to know that I've been with PUBG since it first came to the early access stage, and with over 1000 solid hours of play, my prespective on this game shouldn't be taken lightly, with that being said let's get right into it:The developers of this game couldn't possibly have forseen just how popular this game would get when they first put it onto the early access stage, it didn't take very long for this game to become the most popular ever on Steam so I sympathize with them to a degree on that, however they didn't handle the growth at all well.The developers (PUBG Corporation) are probably the richest gaming company in existance (close to a billion pounds on PC game sales alone, and that is of course, without even including the money they have recieved from steam market sales and xbox sales) yet they refuse to invest their money into improving player experiance. When I played back in the early access stages the developers were decent, regular updates arrived that actually made a difference. (Most of the updates now are so minor they are not even worth mentioning.) Throughout all of their most recent updates, they always make it sound like they are doing something ground breaking, when in reality, they are doing the most minor of things such as fixing a sound error bug.There has only been one update worth talking about since the game was released in my opinion, and that update was for two new cosmetic crates to be released... instead of fixing bugs and listening to player feedback they just look for more ways to make money faster, more crates and cosmetic items means more sales which means more money, the developers care only for money and player experiance might as well be thrown straight out the window, for example:There are lots and lots of ping/rubber banding issues because they don't have a good server infranstructure despite having all the money they need to make it work well. They even admitted themselves that their servers couldn't handle the amount of players it was experiancing, so instead of fixing it they just let more people flood the servers and they didn't do anything about it until the game was basically unplayable, as every time you went to connect to the lobby you would get some error message saying connection lost or something like that. They finally fixed it but only because it litterally had to break the game for them to do so. Even now it's still a bit of a joke, I can't connect somedays because of my no connection error which is really annoying, every game or so I experiance brief sessions of rubber banding and lag too, mostly at the start of matches.Every game has cheaters, you can't get rid of them but you can reduce them! The developers have worked hard to stop cheaters and they have banned so many of them which is fantastic right!? (In January 2018 alone over 1 million cheaters were banned!) BUT let me stop you right there... before most of you start to think this is a good thing, I'm here to tell you it's not. Their agenda isn't to stop cheaters so player experiance can improve, their agenda is to ban cheaters but at the same time allow those same cheaters to just buy the game again on another account and start playing... why do they do this? Well it's quite simple; cheaters can buy the game and use their cheats to grind BP (Battlepoints which is a form of virtual currency in-game that can be used to buy crates which in turn can be sold on the market for steam wallet funds.)Cheaters get banned, but they have used their cheats to grind thousands of BP which has allowed them to purchase enough crates to just buy another copy of PUBG on another account if they are banned, which means the developers get more money every time a cheater buys the game again.There are currently two maps in play, and the community is pretty devided between them. Some people prefer the original grassland map variet, but others prefer the newer desert wasteland varient. When you queue for a match you will be thrown into a random map without the option to choose. There is no choice for map selection which has made many people a little bit ticked off to say the least, for over two months since the game was officially released on Steam the community has been asking for map selection and yet we are still waiting for it, how hard can it be to simply impliment a map selection feature into the game?It must be very hard, after all the programmers are all too busy with other things that matter more than map selection, and those things are called money. I wouldn't be surprised if the developers next update is for the Steam badge, steam badge means more card/background/emoticon sales on the market and so on... which means more money for the developers.Believe it or not but this is the only game on Steam that dosen't allow family sharing... wow. This is the most popular game on steam but you won't allow families to share it? This dosen't affect me but I'm damn sure that some people are very angry about this. They got rid of familty sharing because (Supposidly cheaters were exploiting it.) Yeah right... back when family sharing was available this was what happend: You would play PUBG on an account that is sharing it from another account, and when you played it you would get put onto the master account. So if you cheat on an alternate account via family sharing it will link back to the original owners account, cheaters couldn't just share the game and cheat as both their alternate account and main account would be banned. Cheaters were not exploiting this, that's just some sad excuse from the developers to get rid of family sharing, but why disable family share you ask? Simple, that means that all the accounts that were sharing PUBG must now buy their own copy of PUBG if they wish to play it... which means more and more sales... see where it's going? This game is all about MONEY.I could carry on writing so much more, but I'm actually getting pretty mad when I think about just how greedy these once good developers have become. I hope you got the gist, but if not I'll summarise it for you:"

The problem for me is that this one map is getting old, but even more than that, the hackers are getting out of control. The leaderboards are full of Wg_qun-xxxxxxxx (or some variation), I've been headshot more and more often by one of these kinds of accounts while watching 3-4 others die within seconds of me all from headshots, all from the same guy. It's obvious, it's getting worse, and in a game where you spend 15+ minutes looting and only get one chance per match, I don't want to waste that time just to die to some Chinese aimbot account.I can live with the bugs, I can live with the single map for now, I can even live with the server issues and continually having the asian server selected after every match even though I'm in North America, but the hacking is rampant, and obvious, and really just ruins the game for me.I know this is early access, and I hope they will do something about it, but this is a problem with every shooter i've played, and as long as people are paying for access to these hacks, they're not going to stop. It shouldn't be that hard to spot them with their 40+ k/d ratios and thousands of headshots in under 100 matches. Maybe start banning these guys instead of people streamers complain about?

42,"1,239.7",Not Recommended, January 16,17,"AbstractA game with a lot of potential with high hardware requirements, but ruined, brought down and destroyed by Chinese cheaters and the development team who refuse to solve the problem. Do NOT buy.Feel free to ask any specific questions you have and I will answer right away.ReviewAt its heart, the concept of gameplay that PUBG has developed is extremely fun. It offers a unique combination of first person shooter skills, third person strategy, teamwork, randomness and luck, that makes the rare wins exhilarating and memorable, and the many, many, many lost games frustrating. In addition, the inclusion of vehicles, the need to travel long distances, and the random glitches sometimes produce moments of hilarity and laugh-out-loud ludicrousness that itself provides entertainment making the game worth the price.However, all of this is severely tainted by two major problems.First, the game is severely unoptimized, buggy, and laggy. The netcode is a disaster, with round-the-corner damage very common, and unrecognized hits on enemies. Server performance varies from game to game and region to region. Desynchronization between the players and servers is a regular occurrence, and was in fact horrendous at the time of the official 1.0 release, which was rushed out before Christmas 2017 in order to garner the most sales.This led to major rubber-banding, where if more than 5 or 6 people landed in the same area at the beginning of the match, you would all be fighting the server more than each other, as you took one step forwards only to be pulled two steps back as the servers struggled to synchronize everyone’s positions. Later updates did improve the situation, but a lot of damage has been done.The next issue is hacking. Cheats are readily available for the game, and aimbot, speedhack, no recoil, wallhack, invisibility and other hacks are all in use. The cheaters are rampant and destroy most matches with their illegal and unfair advantages. I have played many other games for hundreds of hours, and have never seen such a prevalence of cheaters anywhere before. It is completely out of control and destroys the community, the gaming experience, and leads to a complete waste of precious leisure time.These two problems, desynchronization and cheating, are exploited the most by Chinese players. All the cheaters I have come across are Chinese, and all the abuse of the netcode, by using high ping to sponge bullets, is also done by Chinese players. We know they are Chinese based on their names, or because they have long numbers and letters for names but speak loudly in all-chat in Mandarin.Furthermore, they often enter Solo games but while in the pre-game lobby they communicate with each other and team up, and then play in squads against the rest of the server who are playing as individual solo players. This is called “teaming” and is a banning offence, however it is not being policed. There is also evidence of “teaming” even in squad games, where 10 or more Chinese players make teams (when 4 is the maximum per team), using the in-game clothing items to coordinate and organize themselves. They have flooded every regional server, be it EU, NA, Australia, or Korea/Japan.The reason I do not recommend this game is ultimately not because of these issues as such, but because of the response of the developers.Being the most popular game on Steam and the most popular game in China with the largest population in the world, the developers have no financial incentive to shut down and ban Chinese accounts – even if they do, the cybercafés where most of these Chinese hackers play from will have made more than enough money to buy a new account for their customers to continue cheating from. Cheats mean fun for Chinese players, money for the developers, but misery for everyone else in the world.The developers have known about netcode and game optimization issues from the beginning, but have instead focussed on a rushed Xbox port, commercialization through loot crates, and lucrative deals, such as a mobile-phone version for the Chinese market. They have not fixed the structural problems with the game, and have done nothing about the cheaters. What’s worse, they even shut down all discussion about Chinese cheaters.The game requires a very powerful PC to run smoothly, with a 10 series Nvidia card (preferably 1070 or higher), 16GB RAM, and at least a recent i5 processor. There is no way the minimum requirements of an “i3, 6GB RAM and a GTX 660” can run this game. I had to upgrade my graphics card and RAM before I could play this properly. I have supported this game since Early Access and also having invested so much money and time into what is clearly a great concept, the game is not recommendable because of the terrible playing experience brought about by the Chinese cheaters and the developers’ stubborn refusal to address the issue.Not recommended. DO BUY.I will only recommend the game when Chinese players are region-locked to their own regional servers, and when all the netcode and hitregistry issues are sorted out. We don’t need bells and whistles but some basic stability and a fair playing environment for all paying customers."

It made me scratch my head since on my screen I was virtually invisible. I tried turning my settings down and then I realized on low settings the darkness contrast between shaddow and direct sunlight is near zero - about 90-95% of the foliage and grass disappears - character models are super distinct against in game objects - low render distance means that character models still render at max distance, but all of their visual cover disappears (you can literally look through trees, bushes, and grass. It's like having a wall hack turned on).In summation - it's a really cool game, but I am not interested in playing with potato quality graphics.

79,222.8,Recommended," March 28, 2017",108,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWI'll preface this review by saying Battlegrounds by no means complete nor well-optimized in it's current state. However, that does not mean it is unenjoyable or unplayable.Despite my short amount of time in-game, I can confidently say is much better than it's counterpart, H1Z1 King of the Kill for a number of reasons:1. Its weapon variety is much healthier and (somewhat) balanced in customability, strengths and weaknesses (and will evidently grow in number).2. Some central mechanics of the game are much more realistic and less buggy in comparison to its counterpart (you can't jump out of cars that are flying at the speed of light and live; weapons actually hit where you aim, at least along the vertical axis - bullet drop is a thing!).3. There are tons of servers already, and they are more often than not at least playable (I've only had one account of having to leave the game due to horrendous lag).4. Graphically, it's a beautiful game at its highest settings, although it is nearly impossible to play with said settings effectively due to poor optimization, and thus FPS issues/inconsistencies.5. The Steam Market already includes the game's in-game skins and items available to characters; another thing worth noting here is that it's relatively easy to earn ""Reward Points"" from simply playing the game. With this, you can gradually purchase crates which will randomly drop said skins.6. The game actually feels fun and fair to play. There are a minute number of instances that feel like I was killed due to poor game design or exploitations.Again, this game is by no means complete or the absolute best thing I've played thus far, but it's shaping up to be extremely promising. The Battle Royale in the Arma series were extremely fun, but just a little too slow-paced it seemed; H1Z1 had and has a number of problems that are fundamental to a game's success and playability; Battlegrounds appears to be setting a new standard in battle royale-type games."

GameplayYou drop from plane, loot weapons, kill anyone you see, last man standing win. The gameplay is good, better than other battle royale games. Very competitive, except if you face the enemy I list on no 4 below.2. Graphic and SoundSound was terrible at the early release, awful. But they start to improve it one by one, but for me, it's still below average, and instead of screaming in pain your character will make funny sound when get hurt. Graphic is, well even it is looks good even at low quality, but it is poorly less optimized. The color is somewhat dull and I use reshade to make it more vivid.Umm, I don't know. Still performance issue , and the server itself still lagging sometimes.In this game you will face many enemies, the main 4 enemies are:- Cheaters,- Lags,- Bugs, and- StreamersYou can't win or it's hard to win against them, with exception the streamers, if you kill them or honk near them 9/10 chance you will get banned. So pick your victim wisely, basically you'll need sixth sense or stream-but-not-snipe them to tell if they are streamers or not.This game feature so many game breaking bugs and glitches, some of them are:- - fixed,- Render fail and walking and see through building,- Teleporting spot, send you to the sky or to the edge of the map,- Can walking inside some rock, wall, hay, or plane on military base ,- Bodies rendered to another place when driving vehicle, and if your another body killed you will die on that vehicle too ,- Vehicle stuck on illogical spot and explode immediately,- Vehicle drop to ""underworld"",- Stuck on sky while parachuting,- On squad, sometimes if you knocked out on a bike, you can still drive that bike while on dying position and it's impossible to revived,- Killer Lag, you literally killed after the server lag and get placed on 98th rank even there was like 30 players alive or even on top 10 before that lag kill you.- and some more bugsI don't know if I can recommend this game or not, even this game reach version 1.0, it still have major problems.

If someone at Unreal didnt warn bluehole that 100 people in this engine was insane, they should have.

(seems they are now in a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥contest with Unreal....again, triggered and stupid response to someone making a better version of your game mode)Because so many have purchased this game early and suffered all the seriously unnecessary performance issues, I think they will find that it will more then likely die quickly if their response to issues doesnt match its meteoric rise.

(Basically a VPN software that makes you connect to the game faster)It says 'The only official accelerator of the game'..The ad appears only if you connect from China, so it wouldn't be a problem for players elsewhere, but why did Bluehole even approved this?

What kind of developer do this?----------------------------Oct.19--------------------------------UPDATE: Bluehole has ended the partnership with the accelerator software on Oct.5. The ad has been removed since then. Those who accuse me of spreading disinformation, check your sources.Okey, I never expected so many people would be reading this review. I think I should clearify a few things:1. There is no Chinese server. ever. Bluehole tells who is a 'Chinese' player based on his ip. As long as Bluehole saw you as 'Chinese', the ad showed up no matter which server you tried to connect to.(Again, the Ad has been removed so nobody is going to see it anymore)2. It's not all about the Ad, it's about their bussiness model. Instead of fixing their game and their servers, they are already thinking about ways to abuse their popularity for profit.

I don't want to mention the R word but please do not judge other people by on their nationality or ethnics. btw Bluehole is a Korean (which means, Asian) company.4.

179,190.8,Recommended," March 23, 2017",643,"Product received for freeNote: I did get this game for free. I got it for free because I took part in the Pre-Alpha that happened (I think) in July of 2016. Getting the game for free doesn’t affect my review at all (it gets nit and gritty towards the end).---For those wondering, why is this so familiar?- Well, because the person behind this game is PLAYERUNKNOWN (as stated in the title of the game). It’s his standalone game. He first started his Battle Royale work in Arma 2/3 as Mods. Than Daybreak licensed Battle Royale gamemode from him and they implemented that his game mode in their game called ‘H1Z1,’ later on they saw the potential of Battle Royale and they split the game into 2 games with one game that only has the Battle Royale game mode called H1Z1.What does BATTLEGROUNDS (PUBG) feel like?- It’s a mixture of Arma 3 and H1Z1, but more or less it feels like Arma (but not clunky) since it’s not arcadey like H1Z1 and it actually takes skill to learn. It’s not just about getting kills. It’s about surviving. If you like tactical’ness, outsmarting your opponent, a non-clucky engine like Arma 3 and just an overall fun time. This is the game for you. In Arma 3, it’s slow pace and walking everywhere, sometimes taking a vehicle. In H1Z1, almost everyone is in a car and if you get near someone they jump out (while the car is going full speed) and they try to shoot you. In this game, it’s medium pace, the vehicles in BATTLEGROUNDS will get you killed if you randomly jump out to kill someone at full or half speed.In BATTLEGROUNDS, you have servers where you can go Solo or find a teammate(s) in Duo and SQUAD, just like in H1Z1. Unlike in H1Z1, but like in Arma 3, if you team in Solo servers you will get banned. PLAYERUNKNOWN promised that Mod support would be coming at official release. But, Mod support is nowhere to be found in 1.0. They stated that Mod support to the point where you can create your own Battle Royale game mode (and publish it to the Steam Workshop), host it (maybe rent a server like in the Battlefield series) and have your own community or group of friends play it. Weapon-wise, all these weapons don’t have predicable weapon recoil, they’re all different, as well with the bullet drop/travel. Attachments like forgrips, compensators and more all can decrease the recoil and change the final outcome of the game when it comes down to that 1v1 at the end. You can’t use 3rd person shooting all the time, it’s not accurate as 1st person shooting (like in H1Z1, both 1st and 2nd can be used at medium/long).As I mentioned in the beginning, getting the game for free doesn’t affect my review at all. But because this is a review, I have to be unbiased and review all aspects of the game, even the company behind the game. I give the score what I gave it because of one issue. They were very disrespectful, closed minded and banned me on many platforms to censor me. I would have given this game a 9/10 if this situation didn’t happen/taken place.In the end, I’m glad PU made the Mod in Arma 2/3 and Daybreak licensed the Battle Royale mode from PLAYERUNKNOWN. He got rid of the clucky’ness from Arma and understood all of H1Z1 mistakes, downfalls, lack of communication/game updates and made his own game. And to be honest with you, this game is pretty bada** and worth the buy. I’m glad that I was able to see this game grow when when Pre-Alpha was going on. And let's face it, H1Z1 is still in Early Access just this upcoming January in 2018, it will be 3 years in Early Access... PUBG put H1Z1 in it's coffin.It’s one of those games that you will come back and play each day just because how fun it is, H1Z1 (or other BR related titles) can’t do this.---My Review Score: 8/10"
158,407.5,Not Recommended," May 14, 2017",3,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWRight now I can't recommend this game. The game IS super fun and addicting. I quite enjoy playing it.However, the game is coded very poorly, and the developers refuse to acknowledge the rampant cheating that is taking place ingame.If you mention cheaters on the official forums, you will get banned and your topic removed.It seems like the developers are giving their tacit permission to cheat in this game, so let me tell you how some of the cheats are being done.First of all, the game tracks bullet trajectories client side. As a result, cheaters can modify the game's memory to remove cover, even entire buildings. While they won't be able to walk through walls doing this, they will be able to shoot through the buildings or rocks you are hiding behind, and kill you when you have no way to retaliate.In addition, there are many cheats out for the game right now that add a player radar, or alter player skins to be highly visible. As a result, the stealth element of the game ends up going out the window. While you may be hidden from anyone playing the game normally, if someone has a mod that makes players hot pink against a drab green background, well, good luck hiding.Related to that, the developers have openly allowed people to modify their game files using shader injectors, which for many people is a way to pretty up the game. However, it's equally easy to use these shader mods to remove key features from the game that add cover and make you harder to spot, such as removing ground foliage, or making the shadows highly saturated or completely nonexistant, giving players the advantage.The devs have outright said this is ok, so they support cheating in their game, and if you don't run third party tools, you will be at a disadvantage.At $30, the game would be a steal if it was fair. Unfortunately, since the developers support cheating, that $30 is wasted if you ever want to be remotely competitive.The latest update claims to have fixed some of the avenues for cheating. I have not played since posting this to test. Plan to play this weekend.No chance to play this weekend really, servers went down. So even if the cheatingi is fixed, the servers are garbage.Update:So some patches have come out for the game. Have put a few more hours into it here and there.Still don't recommend buying the game at its price point. There are some positive changes being made to the game, and the optimization has gotten better. The cheaters are still ever present in Solo, but seem to have died down a bit.I won't remove this review however, for two reasons. 1. It is making people think hard about buying an early access product. This is good. Early access can be a money pit. This one is fairly good for early access, but still suffers from a lot of development issues, and poor community management (see: none at all).The second reason I won't take down this review is because I have received death threats and been otherwise bullied into trying to remove it. I don't know if this is the shady♥♥♥♥♥Korean devs paying people to try and scare off one of their top negative reviews, or just salty fanboys. Maybe a little of both.Either way, I'm not scared, and I've heard ALL the insults before. So keep em coming.Latest update:Cheaters have died down a bit, probably get killed by one 1/6 games or so. Still a problem, and the devs still haven't done anything about it, but reduced because the game's popularity has waned a bit.New hotness though:People teaming in solos or combining two duo teams into a 4-man squad in duos.I'm seeing this now probably 1/3 games. This is another form of cheating, and again, the devs don't do♥♥♥♥♥♥Update 6/30/17 -New patch is out. It's a good one. PUBG has claimed to have banned 25k cheaters, which is good if true.Does kinda shoot the people claiming it's impossible to cheat and that cheaters are NOT a problem right in the face though, doesn't it?Played some of the patch last night, it's feeling much more optimized and they have improved the performance a lot.However, due to the popularity of this patch, and the devs bragging about banning cheaters, cheaters are even more popular right now than I've seen in a long time. Probably about 1 out of 2 games has a cheater in them (in duos mostly right now, haven't played squad or solo much recently)."

Now is definately not a good time. Hackers have recently INVADED the game.Pros:- Addictive and satisfying gunplay- Looting adds to the thrill- Map design is good- Vehicles are fun to operate- Micortransactions are strictly cosmetic- When the match is clean the game is really entertainingCons:- Hackers- Hackers- Hackers- Terrible net code- Intercontinental connections make the net code break completely- Chinese player base is taking over North American servers and most of them are hacking (fact)- Devs are not focusing on the most crucial aspects of the game like the ban system/anti cheat/net codeNever before have I seen a game thrust into the lime light like this one when it's so obviously broken. It's popular because it's fun......when it's working properly. Unfortunately, right now, it's a hot f***ing mess. The devs seem to be focusing on the least important parts of the game and it's severely obvious, like a turd on a concrete sidewalk. Instead, when they should be fixing these issues they are pushing for the esports arena because of how popular it has gotten and they want to capitalize on that, I get it!! But, this is one thing that baffles me, in it's current condition it is NO WHERE NEAR qualified for esports. It's still in alpha for Christ's sakes. How is it ready for a leap into pro competitions?As of today, the servers are over-run with hackers. When I first started playing it wasn't so bad, but now it's every match. The leaderboards make that fact crystal clear. Even though over 150,000 bans have been handed out it's not stopping the epidemic. It's now said that around 42,000 bans are made each day. It makes you think, at that rate how many legit players are actually playing? 42,000 a day? So, technically, I guess you could chalk up it's popularity to cheating/hacking f**cks who wish only to ruin your experience. Also if you think about this as well, some of these people are repurchasing the game just to hack it again. Sounds like money in the bank for Bluehole to me.UPDATE: 11/7/17 PUBG Corp. has vowed to make good on the hacking situation but whether they do so remains to be seen. I for one am not going to hold my breath and neither should you. My initial review opinions remain the same. Give this game more time to develope.PUBG is fun and addictive when it's a clean match but the net code and hacking are tearing it down. Bluehole, er excuse me, PUBG CORP. for some ungodly reason saw fit to allow foreign connections as well, for example Asia to North America, in a game where the net code is already bad enough with NA to NA connections. Because of this the hacking epidemic is not only affecting Asian servers but every other server, North America being the hardest hit. Expect lag at the beginning of the game, expect lag when a foreign connector enters your network bubble, expect lag when the moment is most crucial. Broken. Simply put, PUBG is spiraling the drain at the moment. If you like the abuse of frustrating games then go ahead and give them your money, if you prefer a clean gaming experience then I would honestly steer clear right now until Bluehole gets their sh*t together. If these critical issues are resolved, then and ONLY then would I rewrite my review and give it a thumbs up because it really deserves it. It's a fun game, all quarrels aside. I have more of an issue with the degenerates hacking it than I do with the devs making it. Without this plague it would be on track to major success."

177,4.0,Not Recommended," October 29, 2017",51,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW""It's early access, give them a break""No. What Bluehole is doing is flat-out not okay. PUBG started out great with fantastic and useful updates, but what Bluehole has turned it into is an enormous cash grab, using everything in their power to promote the game.Bluehole uses streamers to promote their game, to the point where if you kill a sniper, you get banned. If your game gets bugged and you can't generate structures, you're banned for being able to walk through walls. Bluehole cares more about banning those who play the game well than those who are actually hacking or abusing the system.Also, recently Bluehole has updated the game to include in-game ads. I paid $30 for a game under the impression that things like server lag, game breaking bugs, and hackers would be filtered out over time via consistent updates. What I was given by Bluehole are needless bans, in-game ads, and servers that continue to diminish in quality.Bluehole has had eight months to perform needed server updates, fix current server lag, and rectify major bugs. PUBG's main menu has an option to reload said menu, because Bluehole refuses to fix even minor bugs that ruin its functionality.Bluehole's business ventures are what would reflect that of a Pyramid Scheme if it was a fully finished game. I look forward to seeing how this game progresses, however if these updates continue in the way that they are, I can only say that this game and its developer will die as their beloved streamers become fed up with the quality of content release.Fix your game, Bluehole."
328,222.4,Recommended," April 11, 2017",296,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWPros:-Balanced weapons - Every gun feels strong for what its worth, even the pistols-Gameplay - Gameplay feels rewarding, whether its getting kills, finding loot or just surviving, it feels pretty cool-Squad/Duos - Because of the nature of the game, squad and duo queues are a lot more fun than in gmaes such as H1Z1 (In my personal opinion). Theres a lot more teamwork involved in encounters and if you get caught out on your own, you're screwed-Variety - There are loads of different weapons and mods at your disposal. Whether you choose to be a stealthy sniper or rambo is up to you.Cons:-Servers - Spawing in is horrific. I've noticed it more in solos, but during landing (another con) and the first few minutes, people will teleport around, and you will occasionally rubber band. After a few minutes its alright.-Landing - Jumping out of the plane - fine. Flying down - fine. Actually landing with the parachute - Painful, infuriating and slow. If you're not over flat ground be prepared to decend at around 1 nanometre a second, and if you land on a wall or in between a narrow space, be prepared to hang there for around a minute, spamming F to cut your parachute but it wont let you.-Perfomance - Not really a con, more of a warning, but I run the game at around 40fps with a 960 with everything on low. You'll need a beefy card to run the game well.TL;DR - Buy the game, its great. Once the server issues are fixed, I wont see much wrong with the game. For an early access game, this is one that I would say is worth buying."
63,28.1,Not Recommended," September 29, 2017",99,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWLet me tell you 1.why PUBG experienced a lot negative reviewes in these days and 2.why I give a negative review for this game.1. Most negative reviews in these days were given by Chinese players. PUBG published an in-game advertisement of a third-party gaming VPN for them. This is the first time I saw an third-party advertisement in a “Non-F2P” game.Of cause this is not the worst part. The worst part is, after the new patch update, most of Chinese players cannot connect to the server like before. Renting that gaming VPN seems to be the only choice for them to play this game.So, it is obvious that PUBG limited the players who have already paid for this game to connect to the server and discriminates all Chinese players.That gaming VPN also increase rent fees after they publish the advertisement in the game.2. From my perspective, this game is a fun game, but it is not a great game. You can have fun here, but you can not “research” or “go deep”. The high randomness of this game highly decreases the competitiveness which is not helpful for long term development of a game.The optimization is also a huge problem. After the new update, I experienced a high FPS drop. Server also became unstable. The advantage of a high-end pc also became more and more obvious.Although each gameplay is different, I also feel boring sometime because the weakness in player-player interaction. Two situation I mostly encountered are ambushing an enemy and geting killed by hide enemies.Hence, I don’t recommend this game for competitive players and the players who would like to “research” and “master” the game. If you just want to have some fun or play with your friends, this game is also a fair choice for you.However, Please aware that PUBG will not consider your interest as a player since they just sold their Chinese player community to a third-party gaming vpn and force them to buy this vpn."
77,331.8,Not Recommended, January 11,21,"After having this game since the day the game came out and having over 300 hours of playing it, i feel like making a review of how utter garbage this game is.I'm just gonna start off with how irritating and how unfair this game can be to every singular player. To start off is the tickrate, having almost 3,000 hours on Team Fortress 2 and 700 on Counter Strike: Global Offensive being a LEM the tickrate is god awful with the match starting at 100 players it's said to be a tickrate of 6. That's a joke with a game that got 30 million copies in a span a few months after it's release in early access faster than Overwatch, which took Overwatch a year to get 30 million copies. As saying probably 10,000 people just bought the game as of now with all of that money going to them they could at least fix the tickrate of the servers right? No they can't, but instead decide to put more effort into the XBOX and the invitational which are both a incredible joke with all of that money that they don't use or waste on nothing but god who knows what they do with that money. (TF2 tickrate=128) (CSGO tickrate=64) I know these are source games but Valve put actual effort into both of these games when they were released and even before that.Now we're gonna start a new paragraph of how horrid the hit registration can be in this 'succesful' game.The hit registration is a completely different experience as i look at it as i've said before of the two games i've played for a pretty long time (TF2, CSGO) those games have i'd say in honesty above average or average hit registration. Now what i'm saying here is basically a opinion on PUBG's hit registration but to me it's more of a fact and that's a opinion. There's countless times in this game i've seen shots not register a ton with my friend who had a air drop weapon the AWM with this sniper rifle it should clearly knock out an enemy 50-100 meters away whist the enemy is standing still should be knocked out correct? Short answer: Yes. Long answer: Duh lol.As to that there's countless times, the same goes with shotguns in PUBG, questioning why the shotgun does so much damage above 25 meters as it's said to be able to fire at, take you to half of your health bar? No idea, but when i do it doesn't seem to work even with a choke. That's some questionable logic there Bluehole. But i can tell countless and i mean it countless stories of faulty hit registration in this unoptimized, laggy servers with the tickrate being 6. But i'm not gonna explain them all it's just to much with how the bullets don't work in this game.This will be the last part of how bad this game is......the RNG.So this is one of the most biggest problems with this game a good example is; Me: Lands in Po♥♥♥♥♥i, walks in house finds nothing but 4 painkillers, 7.62 ammo, and camo pants. Enemy: Lands in Po♥♥♥♥♥i, walks in house, finds Kar98, has a fully decked out M416 then he goes to my house then i proceed to get shot into a oblivion.So i sit there in shock of thinking to myself. ""How is that fair in any way, that's just more the irritating and a lot more uncontrollable in that type of situation."" So tell me, you can get a military vest from a shack, but not get one at one of the buildings in military base, Bluehole how does that work? So you're trying to make this game into esports but it has RNG and it's more like hide n seek, who can be the best hider to win? Literal idiocy for a game design where what i just explained of how that guy gets a M416 and i get 4 painkillers, 7.62 ammo, and camo pants and then that guy who got RNG on his side gets to kill me as i sit defenseless. Unbelievably stupid, they should honestly make it to where y'know let's have a house with at least any type of level of armor, any type of gun, and at least a few meds of any type. That should at least fix the RNG and make the game a bit better where you get screwed over by it since that one large house that has a million stories doesnt give you one gun.To wrap this up i just want to say how stupid it is how many hackers there are. I don't remember correctly but i think a million and half have been banned and it's just horrible the amount of hackers there are. A sidenote with all of this explaining of how horrible this game has become, there's a lot more things than just these 3 paragraphs that i've typed down such as. RNG from the circle, like you land at the bottom of the map to get loot, no one is there, free loot. But then you look for a car and the circle is on the top of the map??? BUT! There's no car in sight. That's just an other wonder of this game, it always manages to screw you over no matter how good or bad you are at video games, this game will screw you up so please don't waste your money.As for good things about this game, it's intensive and fun in all but it can't be fun when all these things i've listed always happens. It's not enjoyable in any way possible with the optimization it has and the laggy servers. After it being released from early access not to long ago it's just bad, it's not even out of early access it doesn't deserve any praise. The test servers were completely better than the offical release like, really Bluehole? Your test servers were more enjoyable than the 1.0 update that you've 'work' hard on.This is honestly my first review i've really put a bit of time into writing and i'm astounded that i've even done this because this game deserves the feedback, and it's gonna be very very very negative feedback and it was. No matter what the change they do to this game, unless it's really really game changing and benefical to help the good players and not be screwed over (looking at vaulting) by the bad players whom, get RNG on their side which is complete crap. But that's that i hope this game dies someday since Bluehole doesn't seem to pay attention and actually want to change the game a bit and use the money they've gotten from the amount of players and myself including. Another thing in mind is that there is so many things in this game i can talk about, like me getting one shotted by AKM and i'm wearing a level 3 helmet. The list goes on and on and there's much more to complain about this game. So yeah, bye."

Even sat at traffic lights in your car, you never want the car who pulls up next to you to beat you off the line.Battlegrounds is a game that has found meteoric success over the last few months attracting millions of bloodthirsty players ready to fight to the death, but not all of them want to play by the rules. Depending on who you ask PUBG either has a serious hacking problem that affects every game or cheaters are barely noticeable, rare unicorns witnessed every one hundred games or so. Whichever side of the fence you sit on, PUBG has banned roughly tens of thousands of hackers in the last three months, so they're certainly out there. You may very well have played with a hacker, but the truth is you'd never know it, if the hacker slowly stalked you using ESP, an ability that grants the cheater extra sensory perception of your location at all times. You'd just think you were unlucky. You can't win every game after all.Hacking communities are notoriously secretive and for obvious reasons, but this often leaves their motives shrouded in stereotypes. Common opinion paints them as vindictive children with too much time on their hands and a penchant for mischief, but surely they can't all be like that? Some of these hacks aren't cheap.So back to the game....FPP or TPP?My opinion on FPP vs. TPP: First off I prefer FPP over TPP. When it comes to watching I prefer, to watch FPP. The reason being is gameplay is more exciting. You can play more aggressively, higher kill games are more common. Gun skill becomes more a factor. People have to take risk to gain information in FPP, you can't just sit behind your cover and see everything that is happening around you. You have to understand when to peek, what directions to be watching. You can snowball fights, If I engage someone in FPP and damage them heavily, they either have to turn to fight me, or retreat to cover. If they retreat to cover they’re now blind to my movements, I can flank them, reposition and attack them from another angle. The enemy player after being caught off guard, or losing the initial engagement has to understand where I can move on him. He either needs to predict my movements, or take a risk to gain information by peeking, and then responding accordingly. If that same scenario happens in TP, as soon as the guy gets to cover he is safe. He can med, he can see all my movements, I can't push him. It becomes a stalemate. Whoever moves first more often than not will die in this situation. Gameplay is slowed down, and aggression is halted. There's way more action in FPP that's why I prefer watching it. There's a ton of game sense that comes into play in first. Since you don't have some camera floating up behind your character, with a super wide FOV. When it comes to what one is more skilled, both require a large amount of skill to do really well in at the highest level. At the end of the day when it comes to the more skilled mode, I have to give it to FPP though."

85,654.0,Recommended," March 27, 2017",24,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWI've never wrote a review, because mostly I'm lazy. So that says something to start with. Having never played a game like this, all I can say is amazing. Yes there are a few hiccups, but that's expected from an EA game. Give it a few weeks / months to iron out some of the ""bigger"" issues (buggy parachute landing as an example, lag in the first 20 secs as everything spawns in), and its going to get even better. As long as the dev's dont go off the road with stupid ideas, or implements into the game and keep its CORE values it's only going to get better. They are really listening to the community and are already constantly publishing updates to stabalise and optimise their servers. Over time this will only improve. They have already stated they want to introduce vaulting which will make the experience far more fluid.Personally if you are in the middle of the road to buy this game like I was, bite the bullet. You won't be disappointed (but I do have a few friends to play with which to me really enhances the game even more, with tactics and so on.) Took a few games to get the ""hang"" of it.Otherwise just follow on reddit or twitter to see for content updates. Again, personally as long as devs dont go ""over the top"" in the future and keep focused on the current play style. For me its a high 7/10."

267,238.2,Not Recommended, January 21,13,"I'm gonna join the rest of the community in giving this a thumbs down simply because of the latency between players when one of them has a higher ping than the other.I can NEVER solo queue the game modes Duo, or Squad, and get an English speaking teammate, even one. All of them are always Chinese, and all of them seem to have *NO* idea what push to talk is, and they all seem to have their entire families visiting and talking into the mic the *ENTIRE* game. It's actually pretty frustrating HAVING to queue solo unless I am playing with friends, simply because there is no teamwork involved with (most of) the Chinese community.There are the one in every thousand Chinese players that speak moderately decent english, and do try to help you out. And I feel for those players, but there needs to be something done about splitting the playerbase into their own servers.Apparently it's racist and Xenophobic to think this? Weird because in a lot of other games with multiple regions to queue, you are either locked to your own country's servers, or your ping is way too out of wack to even compete. But, in PUBG, your ping doesn't really affect you in a bad way, and it gives you a huge peekers advantage. Tired of shooting someone twice with a shotgun and getting blood splatters both times just to have him instantly kill me and live with full HP. Whether or not these are cheaters, it's no matter, it shouldn't happen.I get that there always will be interp problems and hitbox issues. CSGO has them, Smite has them, LOTS of games have minor interp problems where something will register on your side but not on the server side, but nothing is nearly as poor as PUBG's conistent hitbox problems.Xenophobic, racist, ChingChongPhobia, call it whatever you want, but there are MULTIPLE issues with players queueing on other servers just to get the peekers advantage. It isn't just ""THE CHINESE CHEAT LOCK THEM"", it's actually unbalancing the game.I love the game, I play it a lot. I only got it a few weeks ago and Im putting almost 80 hours a week into the game.

6,153.7,Recommended," April 29, 2017",327,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWTL;DR - It's unparalleled by other titles like it. But so are the performance issues. Buy it, try it, and refund if meh.""So today's lesson is - you kill each other off till there's only one left. Nothing's against the rules.""- Kitano-senseiBattle Royale was my biggest dread throughout my teens. I watched it with friends around the turn of the 20th century, fell in love with it but was convinced that it'd really happen at some point. Mum would ship me off to an island full of murderous youths and I'd never see the light of day. At 5'4"" and less than 7 stone, I was scared I might have to pimp myself off to random horny guys so I could slice their necks as they tried to rip my knickers off. Boy was I dark teen. Given that I got so immersed in the idea of dystopian survival you'd reckon I'd have played more survival arena games, but no. This is the first time I've felt like I've found an actual ""Battle Royale"" game that I enjoy and am excited to play. Despite my freakish intoxication with simulated high stress survival environments, no game has felt like I was ""in"" Battle Royale. This feels like I'm playing the media franchise. I love it to tiny ripped shreds as I scream with intervals of girly giggling, blood splattered all over my face.Spawning on an island that moonlights as a lobby, population 100, you can practice combat using weapons available at set locations most easily obtained when joining early (±35P). The island has nooks and crannies to explore but most games start within 1-2 minutes of entry thanks to the current massive inflow of players. You can see this lobby/island on the far right corner of your map and actually return there once you start a match if you want. It's really meta... Once the game starts you'll sit in a plane with everyone else and parachute to your area of choice on a much larger island (aka Erangel). You loot buildings and other players (after killing them) for gear/weapons/consumables (buff) and drive all over the island in the process while keeping an eye on the safe zone that exponentially shrinks until there's only one surviving player/team. Get caught outside it too long and your health will plummet quicker than a suicidal anchor.Writing about popular games always bears with it the possibility of sounding like a broken record. You already know the negatives, the positives and the performance tribulations from the countless reviews and forum posts. To top it off the game is in EA, each patch bringing along a band of changes voiding the initial points within previous reviews. Transposing from strategy to action, the sub genre is inconstant. In one patch the former glorious ascendancy of strategy was forcefully removed, whittling the mind blowing chessboard it started as down to headstrong tactics only because of a slight shift in quality weapons loot placement and its spawn rate. It's since been revamped with higher percentage of crate drops and loot. The smallest changes make you choose divergent plays from one patch to the next. It went from mostly strategy to mostly twitch shooter in a single patch and then backed up towards a middle ground trying to maintain equilibrium. It might end up less like the initial brilliance of a Battle Royale simulator and more towards another generic arena shooter. Who knows? EA multiplayers are hard to keep alive. Unavoidably awful optimisation reeks of EA, testing the patience of most systems and players. Server side latency is fine but too often it'll fail to sync (what I see on screen = not actually happening). One thing is for certain, I'm having an insane degree of fun playing PUBG, and even if it ends up like every other heap of goo I won't regret it because it's great right the eff now. I bought it at release because it was already a well done game and pretty much complete in terms of gameplay mechanics. Running a tight ship exterminating hacks/cheats is a given and they seem to be doing relatively well. PUBG knows no other flaws.It's potently engaging if you favour the tactical twitch shooter, and don't shy away from strategy. It's not solely for genre veterans. If you like the speed of Overwatch but love the tactics of XCOM, you'll be surprised to find yourself appreciating just how much brain power PUBG requires. If you like strategic board games such as chess or Go and FPS games as well, PUBG will ooze allure. It's less intimidating than military tactical shooters like Arma while being more serious than your run-of-the-mill survival arena. Having a blast even if you're not super into positioning and favour the run and gun approach is uncomplicated and doable. Often I'll jump into populated landing points just to have some fast fun shooting, killing and mauling people where everyone is just enjoying the game in an arcadey manner and having a riot. This game can cause uncontrollable laughter (you've been warned). Suffice to say it'll be harder to win without strategy seeing as even a good shot will run out of bullets in a 100P arena eventually. A growing majority of its players are strategic, skilled and smart enough that trolls actually burn out faster and get bored. Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me. I kid you not, PUBG players are the poster children of this phrase. The median skill level has risen over the past month but it's moderately easy to get into for new players even if you aren't genre familiar. Cheating isn't as prevalent as other similar games. I witnessed a blatant hack only once, nude and gliding across the grass like super speed Jesus... More serious cheats have arisen as of late but generally it's refreshingly vanilla, and is subjected to comparatively infinitesimal griefing thanks to the toil of both devs + community.When picking this up during beta I was looking for something to replace The Division's adrenaline fueled Survival mode. The Division was a rare retreat where I had my fill of 200+ hours and suddenly felt content enough to move on. After that I sat there sucking my thumb wondering what I could do to fill the void. Along came PUBG. The only things I need to worry about here are looting, players, the shrinking field, positioning, endgame + luck. The field isn't as lethal since fatalities only come from my miscalculations and the dexterity of others. Yet PUBG understands the greatness of simplicity and it's wildly entertaining. The realism gauge is pronounced the way jumping from a fast moving vehicle will knock you down. On the other hand, I could ragdoll into oblivion by rolling down a tame hillside riding a motorcycle too fast while being able to survive multi flips of insanity like a gymnastics ribbon aiming for an Olympics gold medal, barely scathed while boosting a Dacia off a steep cliff.... Needlessly tweaking balance like mad could leave us with Frankenstein's monster and most combat orientated multiplayer EA games on Steam don't prevail due to this. Despite the train wreck performance, it's amazingly fun and I feel like it has made me laugh the most out of any game I've ever played. With EA, people throw around the word ""potential"" like if you say it enough the game will magically nurture itself from dust. PUBG is what potential actually looks like. It's acceptably tense, wholly satisfying and loads of fun with a mate(s) or alone. Solo is mighty strategic, squad wreaks havoc and duo is the middle child. I feel dead inside when things lag, but again I've had some fantastic matches that made it all better. Also, zero simulation sickness!"

It's based on RNG (Random number generator) which basically determines if you win or lose from the start of a match.My only personal way to enjoy the game is with : You your chances (RNG) to aquire decent loot (weapons, meds, armour, cars etc.) and you boost your chances to make it far into the game (possibly win).The casino-like system within the game works either in your favour:...or the RNG works against you:Apart from the game itself, the developers deserve huge credit for creating such a popular and well-made game.TL;DRLoot/Weapon/Car RNG, positioning and zone (based purely on luck) are the factors to win.Skill, movement and intelligent play are factors.Only recommened to people who play in groups and/or casually. Not recommended for solo/competitive players who only rely on skill.Since the game is based on RNG, I would personally enjoy more ways or alternatives to promote intelligent and skillful gaming:-transparency over RNG: red zone probabilty, weapon drop percentage per density / buildings, etc.-different game modes: free-for-all in smaller zones (e.g. rifles only), training / aim servers with bots, etc.-improved first person experience: creating a skill ceiling for aimersI don't think PUBG should remove anything, just add more ways for players to improve their gaming experience (since 50 players die in the first 5-10 minutes of every match and only 1-4 players ""win""). There are endless posibilities with an open world 100-player map game. I look forward to the future of PUBG."

I appreciate it's still early access but they've got the funding. They have a button on the main page to 'refresh the UI incase it's buggy'. If that isn't an indicator of what to expect I don't know what is.Performance is terrible. People with modest rigs still suffer from poor fps.It's so clunky. Things you can't walk up or climb over are just beyond frustrating. Putting your gun to a window or over a desk prevents you from doing so. When you think you're picking up ammo off the floor, you end up picking the gun instead, you switch back but then have to reload the gun again, even though it was previously loaded.The maps are so large half the time it feels like a walking simulator. You spend 50% of your time staring at the floor for items, 49% walking and 1% shooting.The general gun mechanics are strange. There's been several times I've pumped a full round into someone (the blood spats are an indicator it hit) and the player is still alive and shoots you dead in one. Other times I've shot someone with a shotgun from 25 meters away and killed them in 1 hit.The devs themselves are poor too and act like children. It's just a massive cash cow now. Here's why:- Bringing in micro transactions during early access is just unethical especially after the amount it's made in sales, there's no excuse.- Bringing in micro transations when they clearly stated they didn't. So that was a massive lie.- They ban people for stream sniping and even those that aren't. There's no care for their players. They support the streamers because it's their way of marketing and getting more sales.- They ban people from their forum that have posted a polite opinion.- They cry when another company ""steals"" their idea, even though battle royale style games has been around for years."

Upon entering the game, you will have the ability to create a generic character, select your region (servers) and select from solo, duo or squad based combat. I have played on the North American and European servers, and in most of my solo games, they're have been hackers, some of which are untargetable, have augmented their capabilities or/and have Aim-bots that can shoot passed the fog of war. If you decide to play Duo or Squad base combat, you should either have a pre-made team OR know Mandarin. These are the only two ways you will be able to communicate with your team effectively. As most of the players in both the North American and European servers are Mandarin speakers from China. If the language barrier and the hackers aren't an issue for your playstyle, prepared to be shot in the back or killed, by a teammate because you’re not Chinese and they (the other Chinese members of your team) want your loot, this will happen on a NORTH AMERICAN server.

94,551.9,Not Recommended," November 25, 2017",2,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWPUBG------------------------While PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS can occasionally be an obscene amount of fun with friends, this game has so many issues that it borders on the unbelievable and in many cases it walks a fine line that teeters on the unacceptable. This review is far too long and blocky in text, so for those who like TDLRs, theres a non-specific and ""short"" summary. On the other hand, for those who are OK with reading into this game's issues, I'll go into some standout specifics from Developer conduct to this game's notorious plethora of technical issues and shortcomings, alongside some more casual observations made from someone who has put way WAY too much time into this trainwreck of a game that I just absolutelysome may say!others may say!And to be frank, this game is, at first, really something else to experience! Its tense! Its thrilling! It encourages teamplay, coordination and callouts in duos and squads in ways many games simply dont! And cooking your first, second, fifth and twentieth chicken dinners can make for a truly memorable time! However, after the initial 'honeymoon' phase is over, the game starts to show its true colors and the tape and glue that are used to hold together this mess of a game only become more and more transparent with time. If you and a group of friends want to play together, and you have a PC that can run it (basically 3+GB of VRAM w/ ~10+GB of system RAM; CPU isn't as huge a factor with this game), then you may find enjoyment with PUBG until the aformentioned honeymoon phase passes. If you want to play it but may not have others to play it with and don't need to scratch at that Arena-Style itch, then I'd look elsewhere.Either way, should you choose to pick it up, chances are you will likely find yourself getting frusterated with the game more often than not once that blissful phase of elated innocence passes and the bad really starts to poke out from this mangled heap of broken mechanics peiced sloppily together with duct-tape and glue...As for the specifics, lets start with the devs backing PUBG ("""", or more specifically, their newly expanded subsidiary known as ) who have made some pretty questionable decisions and statements throughout their games' time in Early Access. Such statements and decisions include the likes of:Suffice it to say the devs have had plenty of issues with their darling of a game and certainly haven't done much to make most consumers flock to their side. While consumers (that means you!) ought to know if the devs of a game do stuff that could be considered in violation of basic pro-consumer ideologies, none of this dictates the playability of the game, which we are going to dive into right about now!This game is an absolute mess, technically speaking. Lets get the blunt and obvious out of the way. If you have 2GB VRAM or 8GB system RAM or lower, you should seriously look into buying a different game, or at the very least, read up on the issues this game has ('' is the short of it) when it comes to not having enough RAM / VRAM. As for other technical issues, here's what 400+hrs of my own personal gametime alongside experiences shared with friends has equated to:Its been nearly a year since this game was put up on Early Access. As others have said, seeing PUBG go the way of games like H1Z1 & DayZ is not too far-fetched at this point, especially given the suprising lack of talk beyond PUBG's ""1.0"" release, which kind of feels like the last big thing this game may see. And that sort of breaks my heart, because despite PUBG being an absolute mess that is barely being held together, there are some moments this game has given me that no other game can rival. But between the devs and their actions, and the countless bugs and crashes I've endured, I can not recommend this game to anyone right now. It may be worth looking at when they exit Early Access sometime in the upcoming months, but until then, consider staying clear, especially if you have a budget PC."

455,78.7,Not Recommended," October 20, 2017",18,"EDIT: Here come the microtransactions...Question of the day:Is it really a released game if you can't play it?This game is heartbreakingly eating itself, there are so many good things to be said but so many more bad things at the point of this review. First off, I'd like to say the hardcore and fast pace of Playerunknown's Battlegrounds on ArmA 3 was excellent, but this game is in fact bleeding the playerbase on the mod there into nothingness (which is an honest shame, because its so much better).For a game that claimed to be based with the idea ""realistic but fun"" in mind, its clear that neither were taken into consideration when creating core game mechanics. The ballistics are in general terrible, penetration, damage to players, and the armor system in totality are just wrong. I suppose to an extent the more casual approach to this in general makes it more playable for some but to me it is ruining. I've on numerous occasions hit people with upwards of 10 rounds from a rifle and since they could just continually heal themselves it meant nothing at all for me. Weapons had somewhat realistic damage but seem to have just fallen apart, and players just end up being bullet sponges no matter what you shoot them with. To put someone down, you need 2 or 3 well placed shots, this in my opinion is perfect, however then they are able to be revived (unless you are playing solo, which in my opinion makes the game barely worth playing with all these other issues the game faces). Worse yet is the fact that throwing on some body armor makes those well placed shots barely count, and the deteroriation of armor is also rather unrealistic, you can be shot in the head with the AWM (a rifle firing .338 Lapua Magnum, a caliber that has literally killed in the real world at distances of over 2 miles) and be revived by your friend. Surely enough a majority of the other guns have been totally ruined in at least one aspect or another, and the aiming system is absolutely horrendous, I don't think I've ever seen a game where to end up having your gun ""prone-blocked"" is so simple and common.Aside of this the game itself is just pretty bad, hit detection has been awful since the very beginning, the lag is almost a given no matter which server or gametype you try to play, and so much more frustration to be had with the rest of the 'technical' parts of the game. To make things even more fun, they're literally advertising ingame now by replacing textures. Recently I've started seeing objects spawn midgame during extreme cases of lag and the hacker infestation as of recent is unbelievable, almost every match I play you can see one or two people eliminate half of the server in a matter of minutes. Of course it should be of no suprise that the developer cares little to none since they're now literally working alongside the people making and selling the hacks in China. Teleportation, one-hit-kill and long-distance punching, rapid fire cheats, insane numbers of simple wallhack+aimbot users, and allowing the use of cheats that make fog less visibile and players a brighter color, this game has to be the most cheater-ridden game ive ever seen, its simply incredible how many there are. Of course I suppose they only intend to stick to BattlEye for now instead of adding an additional anticheat or even trying to actually keep the cheaters from coming back, since this would be a loss of profit as they wouldn't buy the game again and again.Atop this all, the lead developer, Brendan Greene, is an immature crybaby who thinks that he has some type of ownership of 'all' battle royale games, he doesn't want to accept that his game is terrible and that there will be competition that will wipe it out in the oncoming year(s). He called Fortnite a rushed ripoff of his game, when it couldn't be any less true, he attempted to sue them for developing it, and the worst part is it is not even his concept.There is so much more wrong just with the core game, I'll probably come back and retouch this review with more information but for now it seems that it's just going to fall into the same spiral down the toilet as did so many other games like it, like The War Z and H1Z1 have. It's actually quite sad to see a game that truly restores faith for others that are also dying of non-progress, like DayZ.EDIT: 1.0 UpdateThis game may just slowly make its way to something significant, this update actually really smooths gameplay out but it surely does not fix the entire game, I'll try to keep this updated more but until then vaulting/climbing has finally been added, replays/deathcam, and significantly better gunplay both on a ballistics and damage standpoint, and as long-awaited, actual optimization and graphical improvement is being slipped in as well.EDIT: Completely removed game from my account and I have no regrets whatsoever."
1,179.2,Not Recommended, January 11,18,"Let me start off by saying that this can be a fun game. However, I'm writing this review because there has been issues with higher ping players ruining the experience of PUBG for other players (mostly players in Asia ruining it for the rest of the world), and I've seen firsthand through deathcams that my killer not only doesn't hit me with hardly any of his shots, he even misses shooting allies, yet still somehow kills them.My issue with this personally is that the developer, Brendan Greene, has come out and defended players exploiting this, saying and I quote: ""They love the game. Why would we restrict them from playing on servers? I just don't get the attitude of some people."" Proof: http://www.pcgamer.com/pubg-players-respond-to-bp-apology-with-demand-for-chinese-region-lock-over-cheating/Why is this a problem you ask? Because there isn't anything being done against anyone that exploits higher ping; PUBG has sold more copies in China than in the US alone. Why not? If you can openly cheat, and have the developer back you up, why not take advantage of the situation? The problem with this is, this ""fanbase"" of his is only temporary. His dedicated fanbase is people who play in their own region, with their own decent ping, and enjoying it. (AKA, the rest of the freaking world) He is spitting in their faces by defending people that intentionally exploit high ping to gain an unfair advantage, and I find it sickening he is doing it without regret.As it stands, I cannot recommend PUBG to anyone except people with masochistic personalities that enjoy the idea of players on the other side of the world beating them with invincibility and network lag in their favor. Until the developer wises up and stops catering to only one set of people, I will inform any potential buyer that he doesn't care about them enjoying the game, so long as he gets his money in the end. I hope others will join me in this effort to show him that he can't bully people into accepting his twisted line of thinking in which cheating is acceptable.BUYER BEWARE.

Also the Devs are more interested in selling you new Lootboxes instead of fixing the game. Cheaters wont get banned and hacks are normal in this game.. and no one cares.. Devs proudly announced that they banned 1.5 MIllion Account... which is A. not a lot for those sales numbers and B. doesnt solves it the issues..

27,409.6,Not Recommended, March 28,494,"After spending almost 400 hours on this game I thought I should write a review about this one. Let's start PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS is a lot of fun with friends even solo but those devs at Bluehole don't know nothing expect how to earn more money because they haven't earned enough by selling copies of the game. The game is simply unplayable this is a joke full release game, there's tons of bugs, servers issue, desync, cheaters, etc. Simply they pushed 1.0 full release so more people can buy the game because it got popular meanwhile the game is not even finished and it's so bad being handled by Bluehole devs, really. All those guys want is money, money, and money nothing else. The game optimization it's not how it's supposed to be when a game gets released first thing that they should have made perfect it should have been the game optimization but no. Game still runs like crap, lets not even talk about crashes, oh and let's not even forget that the ""parachute bug that when you land you get stuck"" still exist believe it or not, and you call this a full released game BlueHole? No, this is not a full released game. This game is simply a joke to Bluehole. Like I said those guys only want money nothing else, why aren't they working on the game optimization, bug, cheaters? Because they probably don't want or either those devs are simply so bad that they cant handle their own game. Meanwhile they add emotes and skins that nobody asked for, this is a joke. Everyone who paid for this game simply got scammed. Steam should never ever let EA games on Steam anymore. This is the last time I paid for an EA game. This is not full release, this is a scam. WE ALL GOT SCAMMED.Oh, and the reason I have so many hours is because of the crates."
58,482.1,Recommended," April 12, 2017",230,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWThis is the first time I have written a review for any game so take it for what it is worth.The main reason why I am writing this review is to say how awesome this game is. Keep in mind that it is early access so there is some work that needs to be done, but as it is right now its a great game.I was a little hesitant to get into DayZ or H1Z1 just because of all the negativity revolved around those games which was unfortunate because survival PvP games are my favorite. I haven't played many simply because people who play them typically ruin the game and it was hard to find out that leveled the playing field, but still made it intense and fun enough to play. I personally do not use any cheating software and I have no idea how to get or have any desire to, but I feel like this game does have some cheaters in it which is very disapointing.Besides that the game is really fun. With it only having one game mode I keep finding myself going back for more but, I can only play 2 or 3 rounds every time just because you invest so much each time you play which I love!! You really have to think during the game and try to anticipate the other players moves. I saw a guy block one of the bridges to cross with vehicles and I was impressed that people come up with in game strategies to gain an upper hand. If you use outside sources to cheat then I wish your PC will spontaneously combust cause you ruin it for everyone else you low life.Over all the game is a great platform that levels the playing field for all players and its up to how skilled you are and some times how lucky you can get. I haven't played the game multiple times and each time there is a different out come or I go a different path. I highly recommend this game and this is why I wrote this review because I felt that I had an obligation to testify to the greatness and simplisty of this game."

The devs fail to lock people in their respectful regions which results in people joining other regions although they seem to be unable to communicate effectively with those who are native to that region. I don't care if their region is full of hacks and whatnot, that's that region's problem which they should solve. It should not have any impact on any other region, nonetheless. This in terms of language barrier.In terms of gameplay, the need for region lock is so essential because without region lock those nonnative players will maintain higher pings which lead to desync disadvantage to those who are region native which results in overall unfair game.I think we as region natives should make it hard for such people to survive and to enjoy being in our region by any means necessary.

240,"1,354.3",Recommended," April 5, 2017",136,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWUpdate on the review as the changes for 10/21/2017 and prior.Wow. Haven't updated this for 2 months and to be honest there is good reason for that. The last update i talked about how the 8/12 patch ruined the game harder than expected and well i can tell you the bugs and issues are still rising to which feels like a soon collapse.With more and more users coming to the game no matter what due to the popularity on stream, youtube, and now even more celebs using the game while talking about it. We seen a huge rocket in users at peak. With this came issues with the crappy web page based menu which would see crashes and login errors due to massive numbers trying to use the game at once. This could be fixed by making a que system for game and at least making the menu a proper coded non-HTML mess but that is more for people who understand that sh*t to really ellaborate on as i personally am not savvy enough to talk more about it.So along with those issues what is is wrong? You ask.Well a lot of things. The biggest problem right now is the rise of hackers, for a good while they were there, but not very present in the world, you would bump into one at least once every 50 or more rounds (well that was what it was like for me if not even more rounds between an obvious one). Now you will see one every second game and if you are unlucky to be playing in a region plagued with them you won't go one game without some form of cheating going on in game. Battle eye is banning, which is nice, but the fact the Asian market (not all asians cheat i know and i am not saying they are, but majority come from there you have to agree) has flooded with cheaters who use the ingame battle points system to earn steam wallet then turn it into real cash allows them along with cheaper keys, allow their accounts to get banned without them batting an eye. This just means the ones who get banned will just come back with another account and cheat again so they can keep the cycle up to make money. This is the major reason why i have always been against cosmetics and market systems in games and always will be. I love cosmetics as a choice to alter your character don't get me wrong but connecting it to any market place will always make insentive for cheating, account stealing and gambling which is never a good thing for a game ever.I still love this game but the issues are so large i can't even add them on this updated post.. i just need this game to get its sh*t together for crying out loud. I love this game and still support bluehole, but i need them to get it together.--------Let me start by saying this is the best battle royal game i have played and i have played all (this includes every mod based battle royal too.) except h1z1's but that waas due to UI and loot mechanics(i didnt like the inventory).First ill give the pro points.PRO:-Large map, it has a lot of areas from thick forest to thinned out forest and lots of cover from rocks to bushes and other random set pieces. Lots of swimmable areas and even a town that is flooded. Military bases and military checkpoints all the way to hunting huts. There are also nice little hidden loot spots too which is nice.-Loot. As said, every building you can see spawns loot. All of them. There is not one human made structure that doesn't give you loot.-Weapons. As of now there isn't a massive array of weaponary but what is there is very useful, from pisols, smg to sniper rifles ALL have a high leathality. My highest killing gun is the UMP which is a 9mm varient in this game and it destroys people within 20meters. There is not one gun that doesn't feel like it is useless.-Buildings. All are very well designed and i feel that the layout inside feels realistic to what a house would have. I mean compared to something like ARMA where you don't know where someone would sleep let alone take a dump this game actually has toilets, pantrys, bedrooms and kitchens. This is useful because it lets you pick better locations in side of the house to have a gunfight in and more objects to hide behind.-Servers. OCE, Asian, South American, North American and Euro as of now are in the game, which is nice. The latency is great and i have not had one issue yet with my connection to any of the servers i have tried (Asian, NA and OCE) with 180ms to NA servers and 30ms to OCE servers.-Server load. 100 people in a lobby/match. Short que time with minimal lobby time wait of only 2 minutes tops. If the lobby notices that no one else is joining it will auto start the game after a count down. This means you can have 30 or so people in a lobby then it will start which can at times be annoying but still is nice if you want to play late at night and just have a really intense match with a small amount of people.-Cars/boat. 3 to choose from at the moment and one boat. All drive very nice compared to Wildlands(the ubisoft game) with minimal issues bar one for me which is that some times it takes a while for the game to notice im trying to enter the car. Not sure if bug or just locational activation issue.-Weather. It can rain. Not sure if anything else but its nice to have that feature to change up the match. I personally hate it because you can hardly hear anyone around you plus it causes frame issues for me but thats because my computer is pretty garbage.-Team and solo mode. Okay now this is what worried me about this game. But it was instantly settled once i started playing. Solo means SOLO no teams at all or teaming. I mean people could team up but i have never seen it. Duo is 2 people only, and Squad is up to 4 players, you can enter with 2 or 4 if you want, or you can just go totally solo into squad for an insane challange.Medical supplies. It takes time to use meds, i know as a BR player healing can be very irritating to deal with in a fight as some can be fast and others non-existant. In this game it takes 3 seconds for Bandage, 6 for pain pills(which is an over time heal) 6 for first aid kits, and 10 seconds or more for Medkit.CONS:-LOD issues. I personally get this because i have a normal HDD which is very old and needs to be replaced. But some other people i know have had this issue before. It causes buildings not to load in properly and feels like you are running 1-2fps. You think its your GPU but it isn't its your HDD or RAM being overloaded so it causes the computer to freeze up. A good fix for this is to make sure nothing else is running in the background prior to joining a game. This issue can last as long as your HDD is jammed up or at 100% load.-Terrain/map issues. Remember with an Alpha or BETA game you will always run into these. Some times if you jump up onto something, it will get you stuck, and there are some locations on the ground or next to walls which will cause this same issue where you are floating. There are also some invisible walls but very few of those.-Overall Optomization. Pretty much not fully optomized. Expect to change your settings to medium or low/verylow. This can be a pain but later the game will be fully optomized so just take your time.-Voice chat. Lots of spam so you may aswell turn it off most times.-Price. Pretty high right now so it can put you off. But if you love Battle Royal games it is so damn worth it i swear on me mum.Other than that i can't think of any other problems with the game. I am by no means a fanboi of this game i didn't even try get an Alpha version when they offered it. I thought it would be another Culling or a crappy version of H1Z1 but i am happily proven wrong.I know there are probably more pros/cons i could add but right now none are so glaringly visable that i need to add to this review. The only thing that bothers me the most is just my own hardware not keeping up with this game and that i can fix myself in my own time.REMEMBER THIS IS A BETA RELEASE REVIEW. I will continue to update this as they update their game."

546,24.3,Not Recommended," September 30, 2017",10,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWWhat started out as a great project with a lot promise got destroyed by 2 things:- Devs- StreamersDevs:They have their focus on the wrong priorities. Right now the game is at a pretty good stage content wise, but stability wise it needs a lot improvements. This applies to server side and optimization.They also tend to listen to a small bit of revenue called streamers, instead of the bigger audience. Banning people by using information they obtained through legitimate methods ISN'T what banning is supposed to be for. Sure this won't ever get read by them due to 170k+ of reviews but still I feel like voicing my opinion.Streamers:This paradise of special snowflakes is where the real issue is at. They pressure the devs and the devs fall for it. If you decide to blatantly put out all your information to the whole wide world then you are a FOOL. It is a battle royale. If you stream blur out your map or something if you really have to or put up a 5 minute delay, it ain't that hard.. unless you ofcourse lack a few braincells. So apart from this, due to all the ranting of these special snow flakes the devs decided on banning people that made use of watching streams (and those that didn't but still got a kill). Aparantly if you kill someone you can never be better than that person if it is a streamer so you get banned. They believe they are the best in the game and when they get killed they always think it's a stream sniper. I sure do hope the devs redeem themselves again, because fortnite is taking advantage of their stupid mistakes.I am honestly♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off that some of my mates that I used to play with got banned over no reason. Apparantly they were stream sniping DURING our lan-party... where each person had 1 monitor... with pubg full screen. As of now I don't recommend this game. You will get banned sooner or later because some special snowflake will think they are important enough for you to watch their streams and hunt them down. And this will get you banned even if you have never heard of them before, which so far has been the case for 99% of the bans.Go look for a different battle royale until the devs get their priorities right."

36,276.4,Not Recommended," September 29, 2017",1,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWAs a Chinese player who speaks for the largest player group of this game, I must tell you guys a fact about how Bluehole handled server issue. Because there is no Chinese server and playing in any server like NA or AS will give players a lag over 200ms, nearly every single player in China needs to spend considerable extra cash compared to the price of the game monthly to purchase access of a net proxy to get rid of the lag. Usually 4 months membership fee of a decent proxy costs the same money to buy a PUBG. But instead of trying to solve that problem for the region that has the most players in the world, Bluehole just made partnership with the most popular proxy company in China and claimed it to be the official proxy for PUBG. And that is absolutely ludicrous! There is not a second region in this world that needs to pay extra money beside the cost of the game itself to play, not to mention that cost is paid monthly. The developer is not only not trying to make that extra spending go away but also making new partners to rip players off more. As a player I found that very very insulting and Chinese players are treated very unfairly.Upon of all that, the game itself still have a significant amount of bugs and lack of optimization. Even for my PC, which has 7800x and 1080Ti as well as 32g ram, I still need to adjust certain settings to low even very low to have a relatively smooth game experience. And that ""smooth"" is still relative. I literally have fps dropping every single game, especially when it is raining or when im in a redzone, which is really annoying and irratating when I am trying to shoot someone or scounting the nearby environment.Anyway, that's the reason why I dont recommend this game. If you hate fps drop in a FPS game, I strongly advise you against trying it."

I feel like the battle royale genre is a perfect genre to show off the upcoming future generation of video games, and I hope bigger companies take it further."

It's free (which doesn't really matter since you'll end up spending all your money on cosmetics) but more importantly it's fun!Ok, so let me explain myself.The game itself is good. Sure there are some bugs here and there but it can be expected from a game like this and even thou i like the game i cant recommend it at the moment. The game has been riddled with cheaters for some time now and it reached the point where there is a cheater in 4 out of 5 games, this is especially true if you play Solos. And its pretty f*cking annoying. Imagine you just got back from work or school and you want to play a game of PUBG to let of some steam but instead of having a great experience where the most skillful player wins you just get aimboted from the other side of the map by some cheating trash. Sound pretty fun, right? And since the developers apparently dont give a f*ck about it why should you? So just dont buy this game until the cheater problem is fixed whether it is by implementing a better anti-cheat or a region lock.#RegionLockChina"
110,308.5,Not Recommended, April 2,40,"OverviewThe game is fun for the first month or two after buying, but it doesn't take long before you start to get tired of the same two maps and same bugs every damn time. I've had a lot of fun playing this with my friends, but also a lot of strife trying to get it working and dealing with the numerous bugs/hackers that plague the game.Pros:+ Realistic graphics+ Great gun mechanics+ High population (easy to find a match)+ Easy to learn, hard to master+ Feels great to win, can be intenseCons:- Slow loading times- Black screens, random crashes- Terrible main menu UI- Laggy gameplay (especially at start)- Only 2 maps- Poorly implemented vaulting system- Buggy (dozens of bugs, differing in severity)- Abundance of hackers- Glitchy vehicle physics/controls- Uncaring devsIf you can get past the bugs, the glitches, and the hackers, the base game itself is really solid, the gun mechanics feel great and the realistic graphics look nice. Which is why it's a shame that everything else is a total mess.For the price of the game and the quality of the updates I don't recommened buying it. Instead of fixing and improving their game, the Devs decided to ignore the playerbase and focus on creating lazy gun skins and bringing out regular cosmetic lootboxes, all this after rushing an early release for Xmas sales.... As soon as a rival Battle Royal game is released PUBG will go the way of H1Z1."

55,216.4,Not Recommended, January 22,9,"I really enjoy this game. The game idea behind it and the way its been implemented. That being said I can't recommend it to any of my local friends due to the fact that there aren't any servers hosted on my continent (Africa) or my country (RSA). You can't compete against players in a critical shooter when everyone your playing against is 200ms ahead of you. It noticable everywhere, from the parachute landing, to picking items up, to being in a fist fight, to getting whacked by a pistol when unloading 7.62 rounds at an enemy (Of course my skill might be an issue there). To the death cam which always shows a delay in aiming which I can pretty much see is 200ms behind.Price is fair but I wouldn't mind paying a bit more so that you can remove the micro-trancations that was just introduced recently. I mean you sold a butt load of the game which should be enough to cover all expenses. And now making all that extra with the micro-transactions you still can't host here. A clan member offered to host it for free (In Gauteng) even and got a reply saying there is to little demand. I mean you broke sales records ffs!I will still play the game of course (Seeing as I did buy it). Gonna try and make my money back by trying to sell the items I got in loot cases before you starting charging people to open them.Good luck I guess and hope this review helps."

That being said I can't recommend it to any of my local friends due to the fact that there aren't any servers hosted on my continent (Africa) or my country (RSA). You can't compete against players in a critical shooter when everyone your playing against is 200ms ahead of you. It noticable everywhere, from the parachute landing, to picking items up, to being in a fist fight, to getting whacked by a pistol when unloading 7.62 rounds at an enemy (Of course my skill might be an issue there). To the death cam which always shows a delay in aiming which I can pretty much see is 200ms behind.Price is fair but I wouldn't mind paying a bit more so that you can remove the micro-trancations that was just introduced recently. I mean you sold a butt load of the game which should be enough to cover all expenses. And now making all that extra with the micro-transactions you still can't host here. A clan member offered to host it for free (In Gauteng) even and got a reply saying there is to little demand. I mean you broke sales records ffs!I will still play the game of course (Seeing as I did buy it).

Essentially, they have set up some fairly bad rules regarding punishments for ""stream sniping"" and teamkilling. The current review system involves a user submitting video evidence, and that is the only evidence available to the reviewers. There is no in game log yet, or replay system. Rulings are decided by inexperienced community managers in what may as well be a popularity contest. Both rules already have multiple instances of weaponizing, in which players who who defend themselves against a team killer was banned and someone was accused of stream sniping as banned due to the sheer amount of viewers who reported him.

0,373.2,Not Recommended," December 28, 2017",17,"Let me start by saying that i do enjoy this game.... While its functional..Since the game was released and was in early access i was fine with how tha game may not function correctly. Played over 200hrs and the only major problem was the desync, which is to be expected while the game is pretty much being funded and developed at the same time. After the 200hrs the game became a almost unbearable to play. It had desync and some other bugs which were very ground breaking. The game breaking glitches were worked on and were getting fixed. 250hrs in and guess what... HACKERS. While its to be expected, the hackers ruined the gameplay, not just for me, but for 90% of the player base. A month or two down the line the develepors and Battle eye began to work on stopping hackers as much as they could, however they still havent finished. Now, since the desert update, there have been not only hackers but still some ground breaking bugs and STILL! desync. The desync should have been fixed before the game came out of early access, but it still hasent been fixed. The fact this game is now out of early access and still has some bugs that can insta kill you is awfull. So the day im writing this review, the game crashed, i came back to the game and was invisivle to my team mate. i could interact with everything but could kill anyone or even move on the server.Now that ive explained my experience and views, i should note, if these issues were to be fixed, the game would continue to climb to the most played game and may even be ""the best game"" but the MUST fix desync for a starters. They then need to work on fixing ground breaking bugs, such as the one that i mentioned about about the game crashing."
0,122.2,Not Recommended," April 23, 2017",17,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWBefore I start: I know this game is very, very new, and that I'm sure that there will be many updates in the future that may fix the problems I am currently having with this game. However, this review will be less for people wanting to purchase it, and more for the developer/s that created it.To start this review off, I'd like to say that the idea for this game is absolutely fascinating. I love the concept of skydiving into a crazy warzone with a group of friends, searching for resources, and fighting against a horde of other people to try to be the top survivors in the Battleground. The music is nice, the setting (itself) is great, and the various different cosmetic items are refreshing.However, when it comes to execution and performance, this game is practically unplayable in its current state. Constant FPS drops (usually happens right when I see another player), various glitches (such as running yourself over), and a world that is so unbelievably large that it slows down the game to render objects that are just a couple feet in front of your character. No matter how low I put the display settings in the menu, the FPS and rendering problems still remain. I cannot tell you how frustrating it is to see that the game isn't any more playable on ""Very low"" settings than it is in ""Ultra"" settings. I have a very compatable computer, and it is almost equal to that of the reccomended requirements. No matter how good your PC is, IT WILL STILL HAVE TROUBLE RUNNING THIS GAME. This game often has crashed my computer, causing me to restart it (everytime it crashes). This game is very, very difficult to play when your FPS drops to about 1 everytime you encounter another person on the battleground. It isn't enjoyable to know that it is basically impossible to be the last man standing.I would rant more, but this review is getting repetitive. My advice to anyone thinking about buying this game:Do NOT buy it......yet.Give it some time first, there is a LOT to be updated and done, and I hope that the developer/s find a way to fix every single last one of these problems. Until then, I'll be keeping this review as a ""Do not buy"". I think I would really enjoy this game (if it would run smoothly enough for me to actually play it)!"

73,699.2,Not Recommended," September 23, 2017",14,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWAs a player who has more than 400 hours on this game I must admit that it is a great game. My background is a player who bought the game relatively early (before vector and motorcycles were introduced) and has access to both English and Chinese communities. As the game progressed through, a lot new features had been introduced and did make the game more interesting e.g. new weather, new weapons and even new map (desert map) and new vehicle coming soon. Along with that I have heard that there will be new ranking system (like overwatch and League of Legends).HOWEVER, I’m giving this game a NOT RECOMMENDED, despite all the new features, Bluehole has done a poor job on making the game optimized, it has been around half a year now with the game becoming more and more popular, from earlier this year when I first played the game till now, my average fps only increased by around 10. I have a fairly average PC specs: GTX970 + i7 4790k + 16RAM. In order to have a competitive game play, I even adjusted some graphics options to very low in order to make my life easier on spotting enemies, yet I am still getting 60-70 fps, sometimes the fps even drops to 40 which makes a shooting game unplayable especially I have a 144hz screen. And I do get crashes around 2-3 times every 4 hours (thank god they have reconnect option now but it still ruins your experience)Another factor that completely destroys the game is cheating/hacking. I know it is impossible to completely get rid of it in any games, but I do not see any progressive moves against cheating from bluehole. From the information I get access to (including Chinese forums, video websites etc.) there are way too many cheater than we thought. Aimbot, bullet tracking, speed boosting, resource distribution and many other functions. Some are easy to tell like when you get one shotted by a ump9 from 200 metres with a headshot when you have a level 2 helmet equipped (happened 2 days ago), or people just know where you are inside the house despite that you did not make any movement; but some are hard, without death recap like some other games e.g. overwatch, some hacks are extremely hard to be detected by normal players. Hence it is all the developer’s job to cleanse the environment. But I still see suspicious kills every day.Bluehole is trying to introduce more and more new feature but before that, promising a good experience to current players is the priority, please make the game optimized and also bring some punishment to cheaters and I will not update this review before I see any significant updates."

Cheaters plagued the server and they serve no purpose but to spoil my ~20 mins of fun. I've seen a variety of cheating (with video/gif as proof), examples being- Hyperspeed (run as fast as a Dacia);- Invisibility;- Megapunch (create a explosion in the plane and immediately kill 80+ players);- Aimbot (automatically aim at other player's head, torso, etc);- X-ray (reveal an outline of other players, thorugh obstacles);- One hit kill;- Many more I can't recall...As the game evolved over time, the cheats also evolved as well. I knew the devs has been banning cheaters, but appearently that has little effect on this situation. I will not play PUBG anymore unless Bluehole fix this issue."

12,435.6,Not Recommended," November 15, 2017",11,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWPUBG is a refreshing, new way to play shooter games. The Battle Royal genre is captivating to new players and is sure to hook in even the most conservative gamers. PUBG exemplifies an addicting and dynamic experience that makes every game unique in its own way. However, even the most exiting games have their problems. PUBG suffers from catastrophic FPS drops as a result of poor optimization. Few computers are capable of running it at ultra graphics with a stable framerate. These FPS drops often cause disaster in combat situations. PUBG is extremely rage inducing, RNG is the most dominant element of the game's meta. More often than not you will land and not find a gun only to be killed by someone who has found seemingly all the guns in the game. One top of this, the game is incredibly glitchy and incomplete. Movement in general is terrible and so is aiming. What the game needs is more focus on refinement and the completion of basic game elements such as movement. New maps and content are desperately needed to re-boot the game however this should not take priority over optimization and game refinement updates. I feel as though new content and weapons have dominated developer attention and have thus compromised the quality and speed of the production of updates to improve the base game functionality. In terms of core game quality, PUBG is lacking, its success comes mainly from its addictive nature and riveting fights. Despite being completely broken, PUBG is dangerously addicting and is sure to reel you in with its inviting mechanics, even if they don't always work properly. To conclude, PUBG is a testament to innovation because of its success but a failure in execution because of its quality, despite its early access status. Once it releases at the end of 2017, it will be open to criticism and its current state is not even close to complete and if the patch in the test servers is anything to go by, this game is not on track for a completed release at the end of the year. I think PUBG has tapped brilliantly into the potential of the battle royal genre and at the moment, the sky is the limit. However, it needs to secure assurance of longevity now otherwise it risks stagnation. This can be done through improved optimization and repairs of catastrophic bugs, glitches and poorly made elements. All in all, PUBG is a incredibly enjoyable experience however take the fun out of the equation and it is a recipe for disaster as the game is in desperate of attention in regards to quality and optimization. I would recommend this game however it would be sensible to wait until it is in more complete state to purchase.I will add, the game is infested with hackers. Especially the Oceanic servers and Blue Hole has openly shown 0 commitment to their removal from the game. Player Unknown is desperately trying to rush this game out of early access to cash in his lucrative Microsoft contract. Blue hole is generally a 3rd rate dev team who are in completely over their heads trying to make a game that demands AAA finesse and skill. Just imagine what an actually good dev studio would do with this game. A studio who releases AAA games at an unrivalled standard. Blue Hole has been shovelling manure to their players in the form of updates, which every time break the game more than they improve it. Blue Hole has shown an absolute disregard for quality since they have prioritized content and rubbish additions and managed to break the game in the process. And don’t even get me started on the servers. They are appalling, terrible lag, rubbish tick rate for a $30 game and the disregard for players in less popular regions such as Oceania (first person servers or the lack of).I half the global players get a feature then the whole player base should have it too. This is simply unacceptable for a game that received so much hype and attention.The dev's suck, Player Unknown seems to have been corrupted with the promise of money, the game consistently fails to live up to expectations and standards required of a game this successful. I will not recommend this game, its creators are complete frauds and until it is fixed, I will continue to offer a negative recommendation. No matter how fun it can get, when the servers work, there isn’t a hacker, when the bullets fly straight, when hit reg works, when the vehicles don't explode at random, when the guy you shoot in the head actually dies. To finally conclude, the game sucks, only its addicting because of the chance none of what I just listed might not happen. If you don’t want to get ripped off and cheated and borderline lied to, don't buy it."

Problems with the Battleeye service prevent me from being able to progress past initially loading into a lobby. Lots of other people have this issue and while there are many solutions out there (found by the community, not the developers) that work for some, none have worked for me, and many others report the same. Maybe the issue will be finally looked into by the time of official release, but regardless, I can't recommend a game that I spent money on and now can't even play. I guess at only $30 it's hard to complain, but I'd rather spend my time on actual quality games, or at least games that function on the most basic level."

Weird.EDIT 12/23/17 So the hackers screaming languages i do not speak have found me on the NA server so that was very short lived its a shame that player unknown himself has said restricing access to servers based on your ip's geographical location (using a vpn would bypass this but render the game unplayable by rocketing their ping even higher) is a ""knee jerk reaction"" to the hacker influx from china, other than that games running smooth for the most part.EDIT: 12/21/17 The full release of PUBG has surpised me and has addressed alot of the issues i had with its server netcode and performance. i've yet to run into any hackers though so i cant comment on that complaint but so far if it stays the course its going in i can change my review to recommending this game.PRE-RELEASE REVIEW: Servers are garbage and inhabited by nothing by the Chinese who feel the need to hack. Just found out the garbage fire called servers reach a max of 16 hz refresh rate. in comparison csgo has a 60 hz refresh rate which is bashed constantly for being too slow. the optimal refresh rate range is 64 hz to 128 hz, Fortnite battle royale (a free competitor in the battle royale genre) runs at a 20hz tickrate there is no excuse for a 30 dollar game that has micro transactions in the form of loot box keys and the share they get from community market place transactions to start at 3hz and work its way up to 16hz max."

Everytime you reach the top 10 there seems to be memorable moments on your journey of survival that really give a sense of enjoyment and fun.This game really builds memories and there are lots of good times that you will take away from it after you stop playing.Pros- Time to kill is sensible- Guns seem fairly balanced- Dedicated developement team- Great gameplay mechanics- Blue Hi Top trainers- Tense and fast paced late gameCons- Optimisation is awful for med to low tier pcs, high frames give a significant advantage in gunfights, laggy cities, game looks terrible on less than high settings- Cars are buggy flip very easily- Loot crates very unrewarding- Armor bit overpowered?- Some games can be boring if you don't see many people- Getting out of cars while moving instakills you at anything over 30kms- Barely anything apart from doors can be shot through- Submachine guns and pistols are fairly outmatched past the first few circles"

65,180.7,Not Recommended," December 25, 2017",8,"The game isnt really worth the $30 USD Purchase and about $40 AUD; its a fun game, but it has unreliable servers and players exploiting the ability to change your server region.I am editing this review because the games servers are somewhat improving, but I still would not recommend this game. This may be influenced by the console release, which I tried and really did not enjoy though that might be due to my personal preference, as I dislike using controllers.Overall, the developers made a mess of the console release, alongside the pc1.0 release. They have broke promises that they have made in the past, and I feel as this might become the new DayZ or H1Z1 of PvP games. Unreliability continues when reviving my teammates, as if they are killed while being revived I am locked into the animation and cannot control my character.No♥♥♥♥♥♥just played a game, spend 10 seconds trying to pick up a weapon which wouldnt work due to server-side lag, spent another 5 reloading and shot a player another 3 times which didnt register. Reliability.Servers also have issues at random, I have had games with a normal start and soon after, the whole server freezes and no-one can move.

I purchased a crate only to have it want me to buy a key for $2.50 to open that crate that I BOUGHT WITH BP I EARNED. I am not putting hard work and time into a game only to be rewarded with a crate you want me to open my wallet to unlock. I thought PUBG was made by people who didn't care about being money hungry, hence the cheaper price tag but it has now become a classic case of bait and switch with the implementation of paid crates, an idea that is getting really old in the gaming community. I will not support any company who is so greedy for money they do something like this obviously despite players wishes. You have already made so much money from selling the game even though it is cheaper than most other games this is just the real creators of the game exposing their greedy nature at the taste of cash. Are you deliberately trying to ruin this game? Have you not been paying attention to current events and what has happened with EA trying to implement RNG gambling into their game? I have always been a huge fan of PUBG and recommended it to every friend (but no longer) and spent countless hours playing but I (along with other players who are against this) will not play another second of the game until this is fixed.

Or to drop in perfectly at your destination, before everyone else, only for your parachute to get stuck in the air or taking half of your health from fall damage after dropping 2 feet. Or trying to vault over a wall and dying for no reason at all. Or the bloody awful desync, being behind cover then getting shot by a man who's seeing 10 seconds ago. I keep playing this game, it's actually incredibly fun and action packed, but there's a lot of stuff that needs to be fixed with it. The hackers are by far the worst thing at the moment, and more and more keep appearing by the day (most commonly, based on my experience, players from Asian servers who come to EU servers and cheat.

829,244.3,Recommended," July 3, 2017",33,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWBattlegrounds (or PUBG) is one of the best multiplayer games you can play right now. To any newcomers who don't know much about the Battle Royale genre, I'd describe it as the twisted lovechild of CSGO and DayZ/ArmA. PUBG works, plays and feels great, and all of the game's mechanics and online systems are just a lot of fun and very deep (with a low skill barrier, but a high skill ceiling). It offers tense gun fights, intense chases and strategic tension that you won't see in any other game - and it also has very fast, fluid matchmaking.The game's in Early Access, but aside from optimization issues, it feels almost like a complete game, with very few bugs and no showstoppers whatsoever.

244,145.1,Not Recommended, January 24,10,"Product received for freeI'm going to ignore the issue with Chinese players and cheaters since everyone else has already beaten it to death.Even then, there's still plenty else wrong with this game.Don't get me wrong, PUBG can be fun and has a lot of potential to be a great game. But BattleEye, BlueHole, PlayerUnknown, or whatever the developer goes by next has no idea what they're doing, or just don't care about improving the game.This game has the worst performance I've ever seen outside of low-budget indie games. I can play Arma 3 at medium-to-high settings with 70+ FPS, and there's a lot more going on in that game compared to this. Meanwhile I can't even run a consistent 60 frames on minimum settings and 720p in PUBG, with frequent drops as low as the 20's. And even if I raise my graphics settings higher it doesn't have much of an impact on my performance. I might lose 10 frames at most on the high end and 3-5 frames on the low end. And even if someone has a high-end system with a good CPU, 16GB of RAM, and a 1080, they'll still get drops as low as the 70's which is ridiculous. There's obviously something wrong with the optimization, and they should have sorted it out before release. Not to mention all of the bugs and broken gameplay mechanics.The cover system in this game is awful. Even if your gun is visibly over a wall, your bullets can still sometimes hit it. Aiming over walls or around corners is extremely tedious, because instead of being like Arma, Red Orchestra, or a bunch of other games; there's not a separate animation for aiming like this, so a lot of the time you can't even pull your gun up (stuck in a passive position) when you need to.Both the maps are way too big, 100 players isn't nearly enough for the size, so you're going to spend 90% of the game running and looting because of that with little to no conflict outside of the first 2 minutes. But the issue is heavily exasperated in Mirimar because of the lack of good loot spawns, terrible vehicles, and having significantly more open areas where nothing spawns. It's like Snipe City on Erangel but most of the map.The net code in this game is awful. It was excuseable when the game was in alpha, they wouldn't have been able to afford high tickrate servers. But they haven't improved it at all since then. They've made nearly half a billion dollars, yet we still have 17 tickrate servers. For comparison, Fortnite BR (and most multiplayer games) has a tickrate of 30, and it's had significantly less development time.I'm not going to go into detail on the bugs because there's too many, so just going to list them out;- Vehicles flipping or going flying into the air for no reason- Vehicles exploding because they get stuck in a prop- Sometimes you can be forced out of your vehicle, but that's more rare now- Player model getting stuck in props/vaulting animation- Vaulting animation killing you because the game thinks you're falling- Walking into a prop killing you because the game thinks you're falling- Inconsistent sound (most commonly with swimming underwater)- Inconsistent fall damage (sometimes you can fall 2 feet and lose half your health, sometimes you can jump off the roof of a 3 story building and lose no health)- Guns not firing on first click/hold- Everyone being forced out of the plane at the same time- Taking fall damage when landing- Sometimes you don't pick up objects when you drag them into inventory or press F- Reticle sights sometimes aren't rendered correctly (relatively large square instead of a small dot)- Doors or staircases don't load into the game at all sometimes (they said they fixed this, but I still see it ocassionally)- Walls not rendering for one player but rendering for everyone else (again, said they fixed it, but can still happen)- Text in the game either not appearing correctly, or appearing in a different language- Frequent crashes, mostly on launch or when loading into a game.- Can't tab out while loading into a game or you will get the ""MatchState Pre-Login: In Progress"" error- Grenades sometimes don't do any damage- The thing where your magazine gets stuck in your player model (not important but has been in the game since alpha)- Firing shotguns causes game lag for some reason ( )There's definitely more than this, this is just stuff I've personally experienced several times.People will still try to defend the game, but come on. It's not a low budget indie game. It's not in Alpha OR Beta anymore. There's no excuse for any of these issues, especially if you're going to be adding more microtransactions.By far the biggest issue with the game is the developers themselves. I've never seen developers be this scummy and still get away with it. Even EA and Ubisoft aren't this bad. I'm glad I didn't buy the game myself, because I wouldn't be able to sleep at night knowing I financially supported these people.They lie constantly about the state of the game (said the game uses 30 tick servers, when that's just the capabilities of the engine and the game itself is 14 tick on average, and 20 tick at most), make light about the issues (haha esports ready xddd tweets), obviously rushed the ""final"" release for Christmas even though the game clearly isn't in a finished state, ban people for stream sniping with no evidence of it, disrespect their entire community by calling them bigots and racists just because they're sick of Chinese hackers and want a light region-lock.

47,451.5,Not Recommended, April 12,32,"Back in summer 2017, when I bought this game in EA, I liked it very much. It had (and still has) its problems like hit detection, server lag ... but it was fun. You had time to loot nearly wherever you wanted in the beginning, you could do nearly every strategy or tactic you liked, whether you jumped directly to a high loot area, took a vehicle and moved to the far end of the zone or you looted your way along some houses to the zone... All these strategies worked for people.The mid-game was quiet, I have often seen or heared no one till there were only 20 people left. I have to say, that my favourite strategy back then was ""I drop far far away and dont`t go to the cities"", so this could have been a side effect, and other people would see this different.But nonetheless I liked it, how it was. It was a great game!But then...then they made the first adjustments to the blue zone. It wasn`t much and back then, I thought it was to optimize things for all of us. But I was wrong! For the last half year they made many ""small"" adjustments to the zone (faster starting, more damage, more DOT the further you are away) to get PUBG ready for e-sports. Nearly everything in this matter was to appease the e-sports community, which wanted a faster gameplay, because the old was to boring for the spectators. I feel sad about this and it angers me a lot, that because of a small part the whole PUBG community has to suffer. That the loudest in the community are probably fast-paced-shooter-lovers, who cry ""faster, faster, faster!"", make it even worse, because all the other voices who liked the game how it was, were drowned in the loud ones.And now....update #10.I have already played some matches with the new update and I have to say, that I DON`T LIKE it! Sometimes I wasn`t even at the ground when the first timer was already ticking! How should I loot if I have to move instantly to get to the zone?! Maybe I`ll have time then... oh sorry 2nd zone starts in 90s (200s before), you need to go! Oh, you`ve taken damage? You are at the edge of the blue? You need to heal? No time! 3rd circle starts in 60s (150s before) and you have far to go! If you are unlucky and the first zone is far away and you have no car, you can probably give up, because you will most likely not be able to reach the circle before it moves again. And since they added extra damage the further you are outside the circle... RIP...Also with this update, there isn`t any time for tactics anymore. Dropping far away, thinking how you engage an enemy or attack a building takes too much time. You will have to move before you can do it. In addition, they increased the chance that the new circle is in the center of the old one, even the last circle will shrink to the middle! They took away the last bit of fairness in this game. Now everybody will go for the middle because the circle will probably be there. What will come next? I don`t want a game where I can make a list of what I'll have to do next! This is just boring. If I wanted a boring game, I wouldn`t have bought it!Please undo at least the horrible changes to the zone you did in update #10!I WANT MY OLD PUBG BACK!!!edit 14.04.2018:I really apreaciate it, that the devs undid the changes to the zone! I also hope that next time, they put big changes like these much longer to the test servers than for update #10, so that something like this won`t happen again.Maybe try the slower zones as in #10 and zone 2 with 180s, zone 3 with 120s, zone 4 with 90s and the rest like #10 with 60s cooldown. That is a bit faster but should be enough time to loot and fight.And one solution for those who like a faster game/copetitive mode would be extra servers. So you could choose if you want to play on normal mode or the faster e-sports mode."

Now, I immediately regret for purchasing this game which gives innocent players false-bans without even answering to them or even showing them any proof for being perma-banned. This is an Early-Access game and has the right to take such actions on players who didn't even attempt to hack the game? I smell greedy bureaucracy and people are actually thinking of starting a class-action lawsuit against PUBG Corp and BattlEye. I'd fully support such a thing due to the fact that they have a faulty anti-cheat system which marks innocent players rather than the true hackers.Aren't you ashamed of yourselves? Without your player base you wouldn't even have that little 'corp' next to PUBG. You don't even respond to the players, you just show them the way out ( post a ban appeal -> go to battleye support and they never respond ). What is this ?! People, wake the hell up, I've talked to so many players so far who haven't been hacking and had been ripped-off by these developers.

Skill of course helps, sure, but there is just SO much luck involved in winning early and late game fights. Early game is pretty much a coin flip. It often comes down to if you find a decent weapon quickly. Late game you need some luck with the zone, but good movement and smart decisions are a factor, too.In general, there is too much luck involved for this game to become an E-Sport in my opinion. Look, all the big popular E-Sports are solely skill-based and have little to no ""luck factor"".Another hot topic for me is how the devs handle their game. The game STILL has countless bugs, crashes and glitches that hinder a nice experience. Some of them have been prevalent for more than half a year, but are still not fixed. But for the devs it seemed to be much more important to push the game out of early access and implement microtransactions rather than releasing a polished product.And why the heck is there no skill-based matchmaking? Matching bad playrers (K/D below 1) against aim-gods seems unneccessarily unfair. Some matchmaking based on the K/D or killrating would be very welcome. Maybe that way, cheaters would end up playing against cheaters, who knows...By the way, regions should be locked completely. Not only China, but all of 'em.

Company statistics even show 1 in every 3 games you will encounter a hacker. 13k accounts banned per day due to hacking. Aside from the unbearable unfairness of that aspect alone, the lag in this game is beyond unacceptable. Every game you will lag gaurenteed when you drop in. Guns won't load, enemies won't load, horrendous rubber banding and so much more. The amount of glitches and bugs in this fully released game is enough to make you bald with frustration. The enjoyment of the game relies entirely on RNG. Basically, very few times will you actually truly enjoy playing this game. Even the CEO of this company announced that their main concerns about the game comes AFTER profits. Let that sink in. Your money is more important than the integrity of the game.

However this game has so many issues including but not limited to .5 to 1 second peakers advantage, full autos hit registration, HACKERS GALORE, and optimization issues. I think if they focus more about creating a game rather than marketing things such as there movie and sueing people they might make some progress on creating a better experience. Don't get me wrong the game has come a long way since it's release but the fact that they aren't releasing solid updates anymore and creating more content rather than fixing coding and making the game a more playable and competive experience makes me not want to play this game sometimes. I know many players feel frusturated when they die across the map from a hacker or they shoot a guy die to him watch the death cam and see that none of thier bullets hit the person. The game needs so much help and It's disturbing the shear lack of progress being made towards improving the game. I will still play the game but honestly cannot reccomend it to anyone until these issues start being adressed because they want this to be an epsort.

However this game has so many issues including but not limited to .5 to 1 second peakers advantage, full autos hit registration, HACKERS GALORE, and optimization issues. I think if they focus more about creating a game rather than marketing things such as there movie and sueing people they might make some progress on creating a better experience. Don't get me wrong the game has come a long way since it's release but the fact that they aren't releasing solid updates anymore and creating more content rather than fixing coding and making the game a more playable and competive experience makes me not want to play this game sometimes. I know many players feel frusturated when they die across the map from a hacker or they shoot a guy die to him watch the death cam and see that none of thier bullets hit the person. The game needs so much help and It's disturbing the shear lack of progress being made towards improving the game. I will still play the game but honestly cannot reccomend it to anyone until these issues start being adressed because they want this to be an epsort. It is not esport ready and the fact that other people can make simialair games with as many people and not have nearly as much lag shows that Bluehole needs to get there **** together and start making there game better."

If you are reported, you will be banned without review and with no offical evidence behind their claims. Played 3 matches, logged off and go to log back on less than 24 hours later and I get a message stating I was banned. You reach out to their god awful support team, and they basically copy and paste a message telling you they have no way to unban you or view the match in which you received your ban from.Secondly, this game is the biggest cash grab to date. The game just left early access and has been ported to Xbox One WITHOUT EVEN BEING OPTIMIZED. Instead of focusing on fixing the broken gameplay and bugs, they just roll out a new map, car tweaks (which breaks the vehicles even more than before), and throw in more weapons which result in even more bugs.DON'T.

While the core gameplay might be enjoyable, the cheating situation is completely out of hands as soon as you reach a somewhat decent matchmaking rating (MMR). Meanwhile the netcode favors high-pingers and you'll regularly die behind cover due to people abusing this fact with lag-switches or simply queuing up from regions where they shouldn't even be allowed to. Up until 1.0 the liveclient was pretty much unplayable due to cheaters for 3+ months, now with 1.0 the new wave of cheats brought a situation even worse than before. And if you don't believe me, just watch the dumpsterfire unfold on the r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS subreddit, the discord server or catch a few threads on the official forums before they get closed and deleted.The game needs strict , asap.Update:As expected by the weeks of deafening silence, the devs half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥their implementation of ""ping-restrictions"" and instead went for ""ping-prioritization"" in matchmaking. What this means is that you'll be facing slightly less high-ping players if your connection is stable and if there are enough people playing in the region you queued up for, but since the matchmaking does care more about fast matches than fair ones, you'll encounter blatantly obvious cheaters and chinese high-ping players in EU just as regular as before.The anti-cheat system is a goddamn joke. The ban-system doesn't even use HWID bans, hell they didn't even ban the owner-accounts of family-shared cheater-subs. These devs give no flying ♥♥♥♥ about their western audience and they basically threw the player-base under the bus in favor of inflated CCU numbers and pleasing their chinese net-cafe customers [that cheat and ruin games, get banned way too late/inefficiently and therefore simply create new accounts, rinse&repeat] just to keep PUBG up in the steam top10 list.The game doesn't value your time, neither do the developers value their players (well: besides streamers) and PUBG Corp.'s PR department might as well be run by patients in a persistent vegetative state. When they're not busy playing dead you can expect a whole lot of ""literally nothing"" bundled with some PR fluff and new loot-boxes. The fact that it took them almost 3 months to scramble together the intention (!) of coming up with a roadmap (read: vague ideas after the dog ate the PR department's homework; expected to be revealed in March; literally an announcement of an announcement) to PUBG's further development says it all.This game is the definition of streamer-bait coupled with a developer studio whose work schedule is somehow, coincidentally trapped in this weird foreign timezone of UTC+."

Of course it had it's bugs etc. but at this moment some things just feel absolutely worse. A first big problem is the server lagg which makes me instantly quit but next to that the new map release wasn't that fun as I expected. I feel that the map is too big which results in too less action. You will get some occasional action but if you don't feel like running around for 10 minutes in between kills this won't be for you. Back on the first map 'Erangel' I encountered people so often what made it a lot more fun for me. I'm writing this on day of 1.0 release when desert map is like 90 percent of the time.

175,114.9,Not Recommended, February 22,7,"I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAMEQuick overview:- Entertaining to play with friends- Buggy game- Buggy and flawed mechanics- Bad and incompetent developers with lots of moneyThis game has a massive amount of flaws and the developers have decided that they simply don't care.I play this game for at least an hour every day with friends because it's entertaining enough. But every playthrough is riddled with issues that make it frustrating to play. There's so much that can be done to improve the game, but the developers (who are swimming in money) seem to be incompetent.To further prove their incompetence, their most recent update as of this review has completely broken the game. The game has masses FPS and stuttering problems. The only way to fix this is by disabling the replay and deathcam feature. The ironic part about this is that the replay and deathcam feature are the only way to report cheaters, the very issue Bluehole has been tirelessly trying to address and work on for the past 2 months. That aside, this game is NOT early access anymore. Therefore it is UNACCEPTABLE for a game to have these issues. Bluehole has so much money and yet they are unable to perform basic QA for their game. This is already a big warning sign.The developers are swimming in money and yet seem unable to fix even the most simplest of issues; issues or things that can be changed by someone who just spends an hour watching Unreal Engine tutorials on youtube.Since release, the developers had had only very minor updates and at a snails pace. The only grand amount of content added to the game are just more lootboxes.Hell, even the lootboxes are bad. Not only are they bland (they don't even have a special animation when opening them to give you a thrill), the current lootbox model encourages you to NOT get more lootboxes as they get more expensive to aquire the more you aquire in a week.Let me describe some of the issues and flawed mechanics I've experienced. Get ready for a wall of text.When I shoot someone around medium distance, bullets sometimes tend to go way below the target. This had led to many instances where the bullet decides to hit the ground instead of an enemies head. Bullets travel very slowly and is easily noticeable at meadium distance.Landing with parachutes is usually a game of chance where you will see if you a). Remain suspended in the air for a few seconds before landing, b). Wait to see if you take fall damage or get launched across the floor to take fall damage, or c). Wait to see if you land where you want to land and not end up teleported to let's say the roof or floor.So many instances where you die as soon as you get behind a wall because of bad netcode. So many instances where you shoot someone, but in the deathcam they never took any damage . So many instances where you shoot someone in the face, but the bullet ends up hitting the ground behind your target. So many instances where someone shoots at you without looking at you (not hacking)At the start of the match, looting is complete aids. It usually takes 5 seconds to pick things up, probably due to server lag. It's really frustrating when you land next to an enemy and you are unable to pick up a gun or ammo because the server is taking it's time. The loot distribution is also not competitive. Maybe it's bad luck, but when landing next to a crowd of enemies, my buddies and I never actually end up in buildings with actual weapons (usually just attachments and ammo). One time, throughout 2 matches in a row, I searched over 10 buildings and could not find a single gun. Loot distribution needs more balance and needs to be more competitive. This also includes parts where the zone is across the map and you are unable to find a single vehicle (meaning you will die). But like I said, maybe I'm just unlucky.During a play session, you will most likely have to restart your game every 3 matches. The game has severe flaws when it comes to loading into a match. Usually on the first match we play, one of us has to close our game and relaunch it because they are stuck in the loading screen.Vaulting is very rough. I can't even begin to count the amount of times I died because my character refused to jump out of a window or climb over somethingThe game does not encourage stealth in any way. No matter how you move, your character will stomp their feet around like a teen throwing a fit. The only way to truly be stealthy is by going prone. But prone is the easiest way to get yourself killed.The sounds and sound direction in this game has issues as well. Some things are louder than they should be, while others are quieter than they should be. One time, an enemy player was running right next to me and the sound was never picked up by the game. Sometimes, someone can be walking or shooting near you, but it can be hard to tell the direction because of the sound system (but it happens more with walking than shooting). It's not just me because my friends have these issues too. My headset is a HyperX Cloud II and I can hear probably everything in the game lol. Last night while playing, an enemy threw a grenade into the room I was in and it landed right next to me. I heard the pin being removed, but I never heard the nade being thrown or even land right next to me.Driving is always risky in the game. I don't mean it because other players can hear you and easily blow up your vehicle (if at least 3 spray all their ammo at you), I mean it's risky because it's so easy to end up in a situation where you get ♥♥♥♥ed by the game world and physics. You could be driving and suddenly an invisible bump will stop the car in it's tracks and damage you. You could be driving, run into something, get stuck in it and have it cause constant damage to your vehicle to the point where it blows up within 2 seconds. You could end up flipping around on the floor and may or may not take damage; all depends on if the game feels like punishing you.There's plenty of more issues with the game. Like I said before, I still play it (only with friends) because it's entertaining. But every play session is frustrating because of the issues it has. Like I said before, some of the improvements that can be made to the game can be easily done by someone who spent a short amount of time watching Unreal Engine tutorials on youtube.The reason why games like Fortnite are flourshing isn't necessarily because it's free, but instead it's because the developers are actively developing the game, adding to the game, fixing the game, and interacting with the community. Bluehole has done none of the things above, or at least at an extremely slower pace; which is confusing since they're swimming in money thanks to this game."

Don’t even think about spending a dime on this when Fortnite and H1Z1 are free.

Designed and programmed by amateurs — even the ♥♥♥♥ing menus stop working every few matches. There’s literally a “Reload UI” button because this happens so often. Pathetic.Dev team focuses on monetization before optimization — usually publishers get blamed for this, but “indies” get greedy too. “Boy, new guns and anti-cheat measures would be cool, but what I really want are some more cosmetic items,” said no one ever. It’s nice that you can just sell them on the Steam marketplace, but both GabeN and PlayerUnknown take a cut of all those transactions too. They’ve probably made billions just on marketplace fees alone, but the only way you’ll see anything more than a few pennies is if you buy a $2.50 key for the super special crates (spoiler alert: you’ll get an item worth less than a dollar). It’s not worth it. Loot crates are a cancer and must be stopped.The replay and spectate features are completely broken. It’s insane that they would try to make this into an esport before refining them. Even the “players left alive” counter, one of the most important features of the game, can be incorrect. The incompetence is mind-blowing.But the worst thing by far is the hackers. If you were playing Battlefield or COD and someone was hacking, you’d know immediately by looking at the scoreboard or the kill cam, at which point you would hop onto a different server. You won’t know it in this game until it’s too late. With the aforementioned ability to make real money off the in-game items and crates, the motivation for hacking becomes obvious and unavoidable. The devs’ greed is literally and directly encouraging people to hack. It’s a win-win for all parties... unless you just want to play games for fun. But who does that anymore?You will find fun moments here occasionally. You’ll make spectacular, satisfying shots to win matches and you’ll feel like you’re on top of the world, but those moments are fleeting and you’ll have little to show for it. More often than not, hackers or technical issues will ruin your fun. At PUBG’s core is a good game concept, but it’s buried under a mountain of♥♥♥♥♥♥ Do not buy this."

They famous streamer decided to stream his game all around the world publically and a guy got banned for honking around him. Now, if that makes sense to you, you can apply to be a pubg dev.-They promised that they wouldnt add microtransactions but guess what, they are removing free crates and add paid-only crates. This game sold 5 million copies (30 euro each), so that shows only greediness. I know that those microtransactions dont involve changes in the quality of gaming, but the reason I am highlighting this move is that the devs straight up LIED. And you know when a mature man lies he is probably gonna do it again, right?-These guys know that the game lacks optimization but focused on adding crates and more ""content"". People are complaining that sometimes buildings dont load until 1-2 or even 5 minutes after landing and this issue still hasnt been solved.Dont get me wrong, I like the concept/idea of this game and these devs are not the worst out there. They banned a streamer for intentionally teamkilling and finally added an ingame report system, but there is something called PRIORITIES. Its 2k17 dammit, learn from the mistakes that Dayz and many other early access games did, because even though you already got the money, who says that the people will follow you on your next game if you continue like that?"

223,108.1,Recommended," August 25, 2017",9,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWPLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDSMy review for this game in early access.So this is a battleroyale game. A match consists a game that has 100 plaers in it. You spawn in a plane with other people and then you have to jump to the playable area. Then it is time to get some loot, find guns etc. to help you survive. You then have to kill other players of course and try to survive a red area, that has explosions in it. It is random where it spawns. You have to slowly go to the marked area where all players that are still alive will go and that area is slowly going smaller. Also there is drops in the game from a plane. Thats the idea of this game.For me its really fun with friends mostly. You can play this as solo, duo or with 2 or 3 friends. It takes some time for you to get in to this game if you have never played a game similar to this, but it did not took me that long. Shooting works well and you need some skill with it. Sounds are really good and realistick. Physics could be better, but I assume they will make everything better as time goes by. Gameplay in nutshel is really good at this point, will be better of course. There is bugs, it is only early access, but bugs I have met are small nothing to ruin the game experience that bad. Some bugs are pretty bad, but some actually funny.The game is also cheap for a game like this. In game items are also nice and the thing that you can open them by just playing the game is really amazing.For me this game runs really well on mid-tier settings, you really do not need those high graphics at my opinion. I get usually around 100fps on my mid-tier settings. I have i5 and 1050ti strix gaming inside my computer.Thank you for reading my review and have a good day! :)So my grade for this game as it is now 9,5/10!"
43,188.4,Not Recommended," October 20, 2017",9,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWThis is probably one of the most fun games I have ever played. I love the pace, I love the mechanics and I love the realism. All of these aspects come together to make an immersive, tense game. I am just a casual player who enjoys the game with my friends and the occasional solo game.You're probably wondering: why am I not reccomending this game? Well, the simple fact is that this game is far from finished, and riddled with game-breaking bugs, as well as some other flaws, which include, but are not limited to:- Textures failing to load in- The way the game handles cheaters (banning their account meaning they can pay for another account and carry on)- The main menu UI being horrendous, most of the time requiring a restart or two of the entire game in order to fix.- Instead of fixing the basic issues such as the potato servers and performance, they are following the money and are almost exclusively working on ways to make more money (teaming up with Micro$oft in order to port the game for xbox). Seriously Bluehole?Most importantly, and I would argue that this is the ""make or break"":- The game relies on practice. Now this isn't necessarily a bad point, however there is a very steep and unforgiving learning curve for new players that have never played a game of the same type. You have to resort to guides outside of the game to learn some stratergies and skills (which again, isn't nescessarily a bad thing).Overall, although this game has been very fun for my playtime overall, I unfortunately wouldn't be able to reccomend the game. Some of my friends who are new to shooters and especially battle royale games said this has been one of the most entertaining games they have ever played, yet these small issues can really ruin the immersion and the aspect of fun in the game.Edit: Grammar"

94,7.2,Not Recommended, January 6,9,"Product received for freeTLDR @ THE BOTTOMPUBG, a game from humble beginnings which has exceeded all expectations, it's topped the sales charts, dethroned Dota as the most played game on Steam, it's swept across the internet like an African bush fire engulfing us all in an inferno of twitch streamer kill streak montages, gameplay videos and memes. A game which has caused more of a stir than the death of the beloved noble beast Harambe, may god rest is gentle soul.Be that as it may, something is still bugging me. At first I kinda liked it, but after a few hours I was totally bored, I kept returning to PUBG, not due to any desire to continue playing it, but because of it's immense success. The constant nagging from friends who swear it's the best thing since sliced bread, and that it's the only game worth playing right now, luring me into a duos or a squad, which usually turns into a game of ""how many times do we have to sit in a lobby after one of us dies at the start, before we actually get into a real game"" After that ritual, if we haven't rage quit, we usually agree on the sensible option which is ""hide like little babies in buildings, preying for good gear, and a favourable circle"" If all goes well, you'll be rewarded by making it to the top 10, where you will get to enjoy an exhilarating gun fight with the worlds laggiest combat, the glitchiest, most buggiest hit registration and the most unreliable aiming mechanics in a game ever. Not that any of that really makes a difference, since nine times out of ten, you won't even see your enemies as they scope you with a fifteen times silenced sniper rifle from across the map. All of this leaves me asking one question.The biggest problem with the game, it's main flaw, the thing that makes it an incredibly tedious chore, is the gameplay. The gameplay is just horrible, it is as exciting as watching your grandpa take a nap in front of a golf tournament on TV, on a Sunday afternoon, after lunch, with the only highlights being the occasional fart, and some snoring!Who wants to play a game which lasts 40 minutes only to have 2 or 3 seconds of action, 99 percent of your time is spent looting, looking for gear, searching for items, scavenging for upgrades, scouring the map for collectibles, foraging for equipment and jogging, Oh Jesus, put your trainers on chaps, because there's lots and lots of ♥♥♥♥ing jogging. Endlessly jogging in some toxic, blue, electrified, force field, thingy.But wait, what if we spice things up a bit, make the looting a bit more interesting. Perhaps by adding some magical items to the game, looting would become more of an adventure, and the game would take on a bit of an RPG kind of flavour. Yeah that would be brilliant, hmm let's see, what about a magical imperishable crown of undeniable awesomeness, granting the wearer immortality, charming good looks, and a 12 inch♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ oh yeah, I forgot, they already have a lvl 3 helmet in this game, that does all of that, let's check:So yeah, magic items are actually a thing in this poor excuse of a competitive first person shooter/3rd person shooter for noobs/not really a shooter more of an RPG/survival game. All that's really missing are the zombies, or wait, hang on, are we the players meant to be the zombies? The mindless creatures roaming around the country side, aimlessly, scrounging for fragments of what might have been a fun game, but isn't because it's broken in every way imaginable?To wrap up Player Unknown's Battlegrounds sounded like a cool idea, but in practice, turned out to be more of a disappointment. Nothing new here folks, just more early access, pre alpha, beta, still in development, low budget rubbish. A game that still can't decide if it wants to be a hardcore competitive shooter or a half baked Fallout DayZ H1Z1, blended with the hunger games with a side order of jogging simulator, and sprinkled with magic power ups."

480,102.5,Not Recommended," August 16, 2017",9,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWI liked this game. It is fun to play in nearly all aspects: fast matchmaking, addictive looting/kit-building, varied guns that feel and sound great, the map's size and landscape/structure diversity... it all works well. There are, of course, optimization issues ranging from graphics to network and several game-breaking bugs and glitches. I was able to enjoy the game immensely despite these issues.I am currently too scared to play and I have not played a match in weeks.The developer's stance and recent actions regarding ""stream-sniping"" are unacceptable. I cannot justify the ban risk that comes with playing this game: If I happen to kill someone who is streaming the game, I run the high risk of being permanently banned (with no option except to purchase again from a different account?). It apparently doesn't matter...- how popular the streamer is (though bigger streamers can get more people banned faster),- if you were in their chat or not (streamers don't have to confirm anything on their end),- if your Steam name matches your Twitch name or not (similar is close enough),- if you even killed them or not (car honking).I am completely uncomfortable with my ability to play the game I purchased and enjoy to be revoked at the whim of someone who is angry about being killed and doing it for a viewcount. It is not the game's fault for you broadcasting your location (to sometimes thousands of people). It is not the developer's responsibility to accomodate your chosen profession.If I'm on my computer and not watching another form of video entertainment, I always have a Twitch stream open and often PUBG. My Twitch name matches my Steam name. I realize I can just not watch/change names and chose not to; I will enjoy my free time freely enjoying what I like. Personally, I have never stream-sniped, which I do, however, use that information. If I want to play this game , I need to first browse the PUBG directory on Twitch and make sure none of the big players are on. Then, if some are on, I need to queue-dodge them which often involves checking several streams. Then I can breathe a small sigh of relief and queue hoping one of the smaller guys isn't in my game or in a bad mood. Even then, every time I get a kill, I barely enjoy it, ""Did I just kill a streamer? Did that sweet headshot I would normally be proud of get me banned?"" This was no longer fun, so I stopped playing.In addition to stream-sniping, there have been several instances where discovering bugs in early-access is apparently considered abusing them and thus also bannable. Isn't glitch-discovery a significant purpose of early-access? I understand it's no longer the primary purpose, which evidently is to get paid for unfinished products, but then that money is supposed to go back into the development... of finding bugs and fixing them, thus cyclically improving the game until it's finished and released. Game development is challenging, but leaving Steam EA is by all accounts harder than summiting Mt. Everest twice.This developer needs to seriously improve on their ""community management,"" ban policies and their enforcement, and maybe take some time to reflect on ethical business practices regarding promotion and customer interaction (among other things) before I can return to playing.I cannot recommend purchasing this game at this time."

Great game but it's almost unplayable because of hackers. 1 in 4 matches in death to hacker, speedhacks, aim hacks, ranged punches through walls. If they do not reduce the problem with hackers this game will not, and should not, survive. Moreover I've found some stuff in other reviews that deserves to be seen by more people-""While immensely flawed from the begining, PUBG brought a new and intense gaming experience like nothing we had ever really seen before.In spite of the bugs and shoddy servers, my friend and I put hundreds of hours into the game mostly playing Duo's, and now we consistently rank in the Top 50 players on the leaderboards.Sadly in the last few weeks the game has become infested with hackers and Bluehole has expressed no interest whatsoever in taking serious steps to remediate the problem. Based upon the limited available evidence, it appears a Chinese company Tencent has bought a 5% stake in the game to allow it to be sold in China, and are creating and selling the hacks on the backend. So basically the developer is in cahoots with the hack devs. Tencent's stake purchases also coincides perfectly with the meteoric explosion in concurrent players on steam stats.While it seemed for sometime the devs actually cared about bringing the game to completion, it appears this game will go the way of its predecessors Dayz, Warz, and H1Z1 into irrelevancy.""AND-""I honestly find it hard to believe they're doing anything to ban the cheaters unless their software recognizes the cheatters. I sent them video proof of cheaters (they were running speed hacks which is beyond obvious and getting auto headshots every hit. can't prove the aimbots but can 100% confirm the speed hacks). been over a week later, they're still playing with their 90.0 k/d ratio.""Did you just read what I read? a 90.0 k/d ratio, A 90 K/D RATIO! THAT IS LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE WITHOUT HACKS! How hard is it to look at the killboards and manually ban people with this stupidly impossible kill ratio!?!?!?In conclusion, stakeholders are in cahoots with the people that make the hacks and are raking it in on both sides, both when they sell the hacks and when people have to re-buy after being banned (in addition to purchases from, ya know, normal players). if they cannot effectively deal with hackers this amazing game should die.

Literally anyone that's played this game for more than 5 hours will have run into at least 1 problem. And that's being generous. The facts that they have a refresh UI button and the rejoin game option being so celebrated show how much they actually care about fixing their hot mess of a game.Next is the overall terrible gun mechanics. Please explain to me how it makes sense for an entire magazine from a UMP being loaded into your body won't kill you, but a pump shotgun can one shot body shot you from thirty feet away.The game itself is incredibly boring, as most of the time you are either looking for items or trying to get into the zone. The overall lack of firefighting in the typical game of Battlegrounds is almost embarrasing, not to mention the fact that the supposed new map is going to be a dessert. Which means a solid third of the map won't be covered in water, so it will only be worse. And you could argue that you've had super action packed games of PUBG, and you got like 20 kills! But then you have to remember how often something like that actually happens.Which leads into the point that wins overall are not satisfactory. Going through a painstakingly slow game just to see a screen that says ""chicken dinner"" and getting a few extra coins to buy boring looking cosmetics does not sound like fun to me. ""B-B-B-BUT THERE'S SO MUCH TENSION IN GAMES LEADING UP TO THE FINAL MOMENTS!"" Maybe for the first few games. But after playing it for a bit you start to see just how repetitive it all is, to the point where there's no real tension.The final and probably most infuriating part of this game comes from the developers themselves. They've shown that they're too lazy to try to fix the performance that they have MORE than enough money for, they constantly ban people for stream sniping, even when 9/10 times it was just a coincedence that they killed a streamer, bringing in micro transactions to AN EARLY ACCESS GAME after explicitly stating that they wouldn't, and probably worst of all they act like toddlers when presented with other battle-royale games, when the game itself started out as a mod for another game and after the battle-royale genre had already been around for years.Overall I do NOT reccomend this game to anyone. It's buggy, has poor performance, is boring, and the developers are major ♥♥♥♥♥."

143,195.9,Recommended," April 14, 2017",240,"Product received for freeEARLY ACCESS REVIEWSo I got this game for free and all because I refused to buy into hype fueled by streaming and video creating communities and my friend had gifted it to me. I was reluctant to play at first, but I played about 3 games and the game needs work done on it. Movements are somewhat clunky, not as clunky as ARMA luckily. The 3rd game I played, I killed 2 guys teaming in a solo match and then my game froze, waited for 5 mins and it did not move at all. The other 2 games I have played were very fun and enjoyable. Looting and combat feels very rewarding and the map itself is very easy to learn, you already have a basic idea of where a lot of loot would be, and where no loot would be. Game is VERY EASY to learn. I would like it if jumping were removed and replaced with vaulting (like ARMA) where it's easier to tell if a window or barrier is able to be vaulted over instead of trying over and over again to jump through something or over something you most likely cannot even fit through.Was this game overhyped? Absolutely. I don't know about you guys but I am sick of early access titles making more money than the finished final product itself. You're buying into something that is 100% likely to have things like crashes, bugs, exploits and inconveniences overall, and when these things do occur, people tend to flip out and express endless amounts of anger towards developers who even tell you that or whatever the message may be.Is it a BAD game? Not at all. It's very enjoyable to play when it works, great fun with friends and getting kills in this game gives you a feeling that you don't really feel in most Battle Royale games... and by most Battle Royale games, I mean H1Z1: KOTK. This is a nice game, and I'm looking forward to the developement of the title and beyond!"

This game is worth every penny. Don't know why people compare it with Fortnite Battle Royale. That's so lame. pubg is in early access, so it has some bugs, no need to create chaos for that.Gameplay:Gameplay is realistic, No respawn. Just 1 life. That's what makes the game challenging.Overall graphics is nice, as an early access game it has some optimization and bugs. That's not a big deal, it will be fixed when the full version will be released.You can customize your character when you first play the game. You can play as both First_person and 3rd_person.Pubg was released this year (Early access). The developers didn't know that it will be on the top crossing Dota 2 and CSGO.There are two types of crates. Survivor and wanderer. Price of survivor crates is higher than wanderer, around 0.80. When u play each match u get BP-Battlepoints which u can spend to get these crates. There is also a special crate which is available for a limited time. That is Gamescom Crate, it needs a key to open which costs $3. If u are lucky enough you can get a rare item.(It's all about luck) believe it or not ,i have earned more than around $45 :)"

208,478.1,Recommended," June 18, 2017",20,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWI just uninstalled this game. Now hold the potatoes two seconds, woman - I'm gonna break it down why I uninstalled, while making sure you know this game is a seriously fun, addicting, but ultimately unplayable game. So here we go:Let's do what's known as a compliment sandwhich. When you're in the top 10 and the ring is closing, you have people on all sides - there are few games that stack up in terms of sheer excitement and intensity. Those final moments in every engagement are simply exhilirating. Bravo.Unfortunately because this game is still an early access game, it has problems. And these problems often result in you dying, through no fault of your own. And in a game where the only payoff for your efforts is clutching the win, 20 minutes of playing only to get dicked by a broken game, again, and again, and again - really starts to wear on the soul. Oop, I'm stuck in the wall, game over, even though I'm fully looted with 8 kills and in perfect position to win. Great. Oop, I died from falling damage? I was walking down the ♥♥♥♥ing stairs! WTF?! Things like shaders, and bullet trajectories are all client side. This means you can edit player textures to be shaded neon pink if you want, and grass to be literally nonexistent. It's for these reasons that I uninstalled this fun♥♥♥♥♥game.Now the last piece of bread - I will definitely come back to this game, when it has matured a little. It needs to get out of its teenage rebellious years and enter into functioning adult-hood. In the game's current state, I can't recommend it - but I can recommend the game as what it will be very soon. The dev team is simply wonderful. They're active in the community, actually listen to what they want, and almost always deliver a high quality monthly patch.I'm confident the amazing dev team will get this game to where it needs to be, and in it's current state it's a fun, addicting, exhilirating game - however it's plagued by broken-ness and rage inducing flaws that simply make it a waste of time right now.Recommendation: Definite YES, just not now.EDIT: I have reinstalled the game, and have played 50 or so rounds with the latest patch. Quite a few quality of life features added, broken-ness and server issues addressed, new guns, new weather features. Game is playable and I alter my review score to: Definite Yes, NOW.EDIT2: Hold on again, the devs are screwing up now - paid for loot crates, the only way to get them. Banning people for ""stream sniping"" - which there's no way to prove or detect. Broken after this most recent patch again. Mods are weilding their power like children and abusing it to the extremes, to the detriment of the community. UPDATED RECOMMENDATION: You'll have fun, but the development has done a complete 180 and is going the wrong way now. We'll see if it changes with the next monthly patch, but the future is not looking as bright as it once was for this game."

280,33.7,Recommended," September 8, 2017",13,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWIn this review I'll cover some common aspects like the gameplay, graphics and other noteworthy things about this game. This is all from my personal point of view and experience.PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS, who hasn't heard of that title lately. Everyone plays it, and probably you too considering you're reading this review. It exploded in purchases all over the world in mere months.Essentially, PUBG is a ""Battle Royale"" game as they call it. Up to a hundred players enter the battlegrounds by plane. Once landed by parachute, they must find loot like weapons, equipment, ammunition and armor and must constantly be on the move for the shrinking active zone and the other players. The last man, duo or team standing wins. Far easier said than done...GameplayYou land, you loot, you kill, you die, rinse and repeat. Your death is the end of the line. No respawn, no revive, no retry. Make a mistake and they'll drop you. No other gamemode. There's a constant being on the lookout feeling present and nowhere is safe. At times this adrenaline rush feels good, especially when you're doing well meanwhile. It's nice to move tactically and pick people off here and there whilst maintaining and communicating with your teammates (if any).The guns are also satisfying to use in both first- and thirdperson mode. They look and sound good, are fun to customize and always spark hope and thrill whenever you find a good one. The gunplay and tactics are enjoyable too. You can use various angles and assisting buttons to scan the area around you and peek around corners.However, I must address one major issue I have with this game and that is how extremely unsatisfying and droning it can be. There will be sessions where you do great and there will be sessions where you suck. The problem is that in many plays, especially your first few ones, you spend a lot of time looting up and moving, then dying out of nowhere. This truly happens a lot and there's not a single percent of satisfaction in this process. You go from house to house to assemble your gear and then you just die. No combat, no chance of retaliation, nothing. Only you and a grey screen with the ""Exit to lobby"" button laughing at you. Not even a playback clip of the player who killed you so that you can learn from your mistakes. You're on your own and progress takes a lot of time. Time that often feels wasted and like grinding because all (it seems) you do is move around, loot and die without making a single hit.While it can run fine (55-ish fps on normal-high, while I can run DOOM on ultra with 100 fps), putting it higher than that is a pain for most PCs, good ones included. Especially the random lags are annoying. It could really use some work on this area.The sound however is pretty okay. Especially the gunshots and sounds from far away are a nice touch to both the gameplay and the realism.You might be wondering what's up with the Mixed rating on this game (you can ignore most Mostly Positive ratings and below on popular games, it's usually people with way too high expectations about a game). The simple answer is the devs and streamers, mainly from Twitch.The devs of this game are players from their game for various inane reasons. Yes, an actual game ban, that ugly red text you see on certain Steam profiles. It's for reasons as insanely ridiculous as, for example, honking at a streamer who then reported the player who honked along the lines of harassment (lol), and he got banned.This isn't really an issue in the long run long if you just keep a low profile. Don't do anything risky like coarse cussing, teamkilling and apparently honking at streamers and you are good to go.I'm not really a guy to delve into the world of the devs behind games so if you want to know more about that I suggest you look at most of the recent negative reviews. I find this one a pretty good example:Lastly, microtransactions. I get it, cheap way of earning money etc. but for three reasons it's really nothing bad at all: customizeable characters, trading items and it doesn't impact the gameplay in any way, so just stop complaining about it.It's really not a bad game. It's rather addictive and I'm sure I'll keep playing it for a bit more with friends but ultimately I'm a little bit disappointed with how unsatisfying it can be as I mentioned earlier. If there was more satisfaction in losing instantly after a long period of nothingness, which there won't be, I'd be way more enthusiast about this game.I'd still like to see the price drop to 20 or so. 30 is a little too steep."

But... uhh, now we're in a♥♥♥♥♥♥hole of a game. It's full of Chinese players who have easy access to tools that grant them unfair advantages over the other players. A big number of people are asking for region locking to solve these issues with the Chinese player base coming on to the other servers.Honestly, ♥♥♥♥ youContext:The fact that we are being called xenophobic just because we are asking for a region lock, to eliminate all the high ping players and hackers that come from the Chinese server. It's just stupid. We should not be called xenophobic for wanting something to make our experience more fluid and fun for the long run.People want this region lock to remove players with high ping, and this doesn't make people racist, Brendan.I completely agree that we should let everyone play on any region they want. But when high ping kicks in, it's a problem. When most of the cheaters come from one region, it's a problem. Maybe region locking is not the way to go to solve this issue, they could place a ping limit for the regions. So if you're reaching around 100 or 200 to that region, you're not allowed in."

124,647.3,Not Recommended," December 23, 2017",49,"The 1.0 version of PUBG still an absolutely pathetic showing from the previously ""booby mmo"" cloning/stealing Korean dev team (they lost the lawsuit). Crashing minimum every 3 games is now the norm, a MASSIVE decrease in stability from previous so called ""beta/pre-release"" versions. What kind of studio releases a game that's less stable than the alpha and calls it job done?Blueballs Interior Design has no idea how to make a real game, the studio is a joke and brings nothing but shame to their names, I'll explain even further why below.Chinese Cheaters run rife in this sloppily coded mod they pretend is a standalone game, and they always will. The state of the game is all the indication that anybody needs that the Dev Team are monkeys pulling levers and pressing buttons. They have no idea what they are doing, where they are going and the monkey is charge is always doing a 'con or interview. As such the game is a hodgepodge of sloppy fixes and rushed additions, leaving a million holes for cheaters to exploit. As time goes by the cheaters won't reduce, they will only get better. More powerful exploits will be found in the swiss cheese code, maybe the most exciting thing about the game is seeing what the (actually talented, unlike the devs) cheat creators come up with in the future.Every game session is marred by multiple bugs, horrendous rubber banding for the first few minutes, glitchy physics on players and vehicles, non-existent footsteps and ghost footsteps are now commonplace. Bullets pass right through enemies at range, or get stopped by invisible rocks and other objects since objects are now culled in the name of FPS but at the expense of gameplay. Smokes are often invisible to one or more members of my squad. I'll throw three and see only two, how often enemies mustn't see them. Practically every aspect of the game is buggy, the vehicles cannot go up steep hills because the AI constantly shifts gears, killing all speed. The VW Combi clone will stop dead on the unsmoothed, computer generated terrain that has bumps and jutting angles left over from world generation. The system demands you rejoin solo games you've already died in EVERY TIME you load the lobby, but will often refuse to allow you to rejoin squad and duo games in progress after your nth ""app module"" crash of the day. In the name of FPS enemy players are now culled the INSTANT they leave your sight, which when combined with the 10-15 tickrate of the game results in constantly teleporting enemies. Enemy ran behind a tree briefly? expect a 5m teleport when they exit the other side as your client tries to play catchup.A very simple to use exploit that will likely never be fixed is to have one dead squad member, split one live member 1km+ away from the remaining two, the spectator can now switch between remaining members and will see no buildings after each switch for as long as their computer permits, until assets load. Players of course are perfectly visible inside the invisible buildings.The UI, recently upgraded for release is prettier and more useless in every way, friendly markers are larger than 20 bedroom buildings on the tiny, unzoomable minimap. There is now two blue markers in every squad, clearly no consideration goes into decisions like this.I expect we'll soon see Brendan ""Tom"" Greene leaving the now monolithic ""PUBG CORP"" in order to chase his dream of finally creating a decent Battle Royale game, whenever that time comes, PUBG will still be unfinished, buggy, exploitable and filled with cheaters."

57,537.0,Not Recommended," August 23, 2017",15,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWDo not buy this game.Devs prioritise adding microtransactions over releasing a fully playable game (those with the game will remember that patch) and the game sufffers from being poorly optimised.My worst problem though with this game is that the devs prioritise streamers over average players.Streamers who make money off the game just complain about people harassing them and they can get other players who paid for the game banned. Average players end up banned when they might have made no error (GO READ OTHER REVIEWS).There is no dedicated competetive mode where players such as streamers can play seriously if they want and people can suffer from cooldowns for not taking it seriously (playing the game for fun).However knowing that there is a single gamemode, you might argue that you should be prepared to play with people who will destroy you (such as streamers/pros) or people who dont play the game seriously at all (such as people who enjoy honking horns).I agree with this logic, and i would suggest, that if streamers play a game with a single mode where they can get people honking at them, they should be prepared for it.This is a problem because THE DEVS ARE LITERALLY ROBBING PEOPLE BY BANNING THEM AND RENDERING THEM UNABLE TO PLAY A GAME THAT THEY PAID FOR BECAUSE THEY PLAY IT FOR FUN.YOU DONT BUY FOOD TO BE TOLD YOU CANT EAT IT BECAUSE THE WAY YOU EAT IT IRRITATES OTHER PEOPLE AT THE DINNER TABLE.I can understand banning players for cheating, but banning players for ""harassment"" is a fine line that is made worse by the fact that serious players cant be separated from casuals. Determining what consitutes unacceptable conduct is difficult in nature when the person who determines it doesn't give all parties the opportunity to tell them their understanding of events.But streamers provide Bluehole with free advertising, and the money they make off advertising as well as forcing consumers to repurchase their products is too much to argue with, and the average player suffers because the devs do not care about your opinion."

(the vehicles and sound are the only exception)And i'm sure even here they'll comment about how i have in the last two weeks and how am I not satisfied if I played for on record.The core gameplay is good and it's very addicting. I enjoy my time playing this game with friends when everything is going in my way, but then RNG kicks in to ruin all your fun.It is very clear that the devs didn't know how to execute this idea properly.For a game that requires a lot of skill, it's heavily based on RNG.Everything from RNG loot to the Blue Circles , and even then, that's not the worst idea they implemented.Meet the !Oh wait, did I say reward? That's for people who reach every god damn game, because if you don't make it to least TOP10 (SOLO), TOP5 (DUO), TOP3 (SQUADS) you basically wasted your time gathering loot for other people. The problem is that you don't feel awarded at all, sure you get your BP that's worth nothing, but what now? You're going to buy your useless crate and get another ♥♥♥♥♥♥ shirt? Yeah, I'll pass on that.Even tho this game looks like it's from 2014, modern GPUs and CPUs still struggle to run it. What's up with that?I can swear I spent the first 20 hours of the game just trying to tweak this game and settled for 1024x768 4:3, Lowest Settings and 4 Launch Options, just so that I could get a steady ~50-60 fps without dipping into low 40s, 30s.This game doesn't have and probably won't ever have any optimisation unless they start putting time and resources into it, but they won't. Why? Because it requires a lot of funds. Would you honestly expect a company that added paid crates after they said they wouldn't to fund a project that wasn't necessary in the first place, even after grabbing $60 Millions from the game sales alone? Didn't think so...Let's not forget about the servers as well.I laugh at myself for complaining about CS:GO's 64 steady ticks, when we got this garbage over here that has different tick rates depending on which server you join. Not only that, but it's not even stable, it can range anywhere from ~35 to even low 28 which is just unacceptable for today's competitive gaming, resulting in almost half of your shots (hits) not registering.Here's a video so you can visualise just how bad it really is:Don't forget to change to your desired RAM amount in MBThey drastically improved sound in the 1.0 patch, so i'll give them some applause for that.But what they didn't do, is fix the . It will still be as bad as it is now.It seems that if the sound is coming from below 30° to any side from your point of view, it doesn't change and still sounds the same as it would be directly in front of you.Another problem I have with it, that there's no way to tell if sound is coming from the front or the back which is a big drawback, at least for me.Everything combined it makes it very hard to pin-point a person or footsteps, there's no way to tell if somebody is in a second or third floor, not to mention first floor footsteps are for some reason more silent than the ones above or below.They are a joke.Not only do they go back on their promises, they also probably won't even finish the game if it loses the popularity.There's no communication between the community and the devs.They're straight out avoiding the complaints about cheaters, even tho they can clearly see it in every discussion page.A̶n̶d̶ ̶n̶o̶w̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶y̶'̶r̶e̶ ̶t̶h̶i̶n̶k̶i̶n̶g̶ ̶o̶f̶ ̶r̶e̶l̶e̶a̶s̶i̶n̶g̶ ̶t̶h̶i̶s̶ ̶g̶a̶m̶e̶ ̶f̶o̶r̶ ̶c̶o̶n̶s̶o̶l̶e̶s̶.̶They have officially released the game on Xbox One and Xbox One X.This video will show you all you need to know:This game is still in EA for god's sake, there shouldn't be any talk about console ports.Fix and release your game first, then we can discuss if this game even needs one in the first place.I also do not like how they're always in streamers' asses.

The problems range from RNG unfairness to the core gameplay itselfThe devs don't seem to listen to people, but the community doesn't care, making it an endless cycle.Stay away if you have a bad rig, there's other games you can play that don't require a NASA computerIf I were to get a refund right now, I'd take it and I would never look back, unless they change their ways."

4,700.2,Not Recommended," September 26, 2017",37,"Decent game, good core mechanics, but too many problems that dev team has ignored/been to slow to fix to recommend. I would advise waiting for one of the AAA studios to release a polished battle royale instead of playing this. The issues as follows in order of most critical to least:edit late 2017: to top off the list below, cheating has become rife for months. Extremely cheap aimbotter available, and accounts can be purchased far below RRP for the banned account. Devs seem oblivious. Every game has a speed hacker or aimbotter without exception.1. CSHR implementation/lag compensationIn the current iteration, players with bad ping to the server have a huge advantage. Fine for a casual shooter but not for a hardcore battle royale. The implementation of this in PUBG is extremely poor and very well documented to be a huge issue. There are no ping caps for region selection which means someone like me in australia can go and play on asia / na / europe with almost a half second of advantage over people there, and vice versa. Half a second's advantage, needless to say, is an insanely long time considering the time to kill on guns in pubg is in milliseconds. Absolutely inexcusable for a competitive shooter.Short term solution: lock the regionsLong term solution: probably isn't one, at best I predict they will adjust how the CSHR works but why would they embark on such a challenge? look at the sales numbers, and it's possible PUBG won't stick around and develop a long lasting competitive scene and remain mostly a casual shooter, masquerading as something more.2. Desync / general combat issuesTeleporting players, bullets disappearing, getting shot behind walls etcetera. Early game is unplayable, mid game a bit better. For a shooter game, the hitreg and bullet reliability is bafflingly poor. Could be engine related, could be server related. Devs are completely silent on this issue which likely means game will be as is on launch. Countless game breaking combat bugs such as bullets ignoring armour, perfectly aimed shotgun blasts going through players, imagine the most frustrating combat outcomes and this game will deliver it to you in short time.3. FPP / TPP game mode rolloutVery poorly handled by the devs. Hardcore players want FPP, casuals want TPP. FPP switch still hasn't been turned on for all regions which means that by the dev's own admission, huge percentages of players are playing on other servers so they can play FPP (hello problem number 1 I mentioned earlier which they don't seem to care about).4. Vehicle mechanics and player mechanicsPlay meticulously for 20 minutes, but then you hit a tiny speck of dust on a road and suddenly your vehicle explodes, killing you, or corkscrews 360 degrees into oblivion, also killing you, and leaving you more frustrated than an aging hooker.The character you control is almost as bad as the vehicles. Slow to move, turn, runs 100m in 20 seconds, which is very slow for a video game featuring a lot of simulated running. This bumbling, unathletic that idiot you control can get stuck inside fences, rocks, doors, you name it, your unfortunate little guy can glitch through anything if you're not careful.5. Loot randomness improved, but still garbageLand somewhere hot because you want action not 35 minutes of looting/stalking. Oh, this house doesn't have a gun. Nor does this one. Or this one. The guy who has been chasing you has two assault rifles and a helmet and sends you back to the main menu.Next game you decide to spend an hour parachuting somewhere away from the chances of this happening again (remember it takes about 3 minutes for queue > lobby > land somewhere, so these sorts of frustrating deaths don't come at zero cost). You loot about 30 houses and find 32 uzis, 12 shotguns, 35 first aids, and 20 energy drinks.Of course the opposite can happen and you find guns, ammo, optics and meds in a timely fashion so you aren't showing up to a gun fight with a knife. But the parameters for randomness are far too wide, which means that skill can't factor into a large percentage of games which can leave you very frustrated.6. Graphics/Sound issuesFor a game mostly about trying to spot enemies before they spot you, bafflingly we have a blurry hud, headache inducing lensflare and bloom effects, oh and they just added a nauseating screen shake to FPP and impact on jumping. There are competing elements in the dev team it seems, one wants an amazing competitive battle royale shooting game, the other wants a cinematic experience.Annoying ambient noises you can't switch off (like there's a freeway in the distance, or some sort of faint industrial fan noise). Vehicles make your ears bleed. Rain will turn you insane. There's even a spooky soundtrack for the fog! Aboslutely ridiculous.7. Community team, website, and general issuesHow could we leave the community team out of this. I'm sure there are a less competent team of individuals out there with worse public relations skills, but i'm yet to discover them. Dreadful bans by the admins. Fascist running of their forums by stereotypically power hungry cave dwellers deleting posts with any sign of dissent and even constructive criticism. And due to the negative community response to all of the above, the dev team (arguably the only people worth hearing from) are now simply avoiding public relations, instead of manning up and learning from their mistakes and engaging positively to help change the direction. Of course this comes from the top, with the game creator citing ptsd on twitter and saying words are important, while the lobbies in his game are filled with the foulest racism and most abject voice communication content i have heard, and trust me when i say that i have heard some.8. Game interface and quality of life issuesThey use a .htm as their game menu. Thankfully it isn't as buggy as before. But games from the 90s had quicker smoother interfaces, and they probably had a team of 1 guy designing it.9. Team/regional issuesFrom NA but don't have friends online? Queue up to get matched with Asian players who don't speak english and leave their mic on while your ears bleed to the sounds of their internet cafe. Want to mute them? Guess what, you can't hear your entire team now. From OC? Same issue. EU? anyone's guess. You get the picture - unless you have teammates online, you're gonna have a bad time in squads. For me this isn't an issue because my friends are all obsessed with this game, but I tested this and found 7 out of 10 games on non Asian servers, my teammates were Asian players who had picked the laggier server presumably for a ping advantage, (refer problem one) and proceeded to pollute voice comms the entire game. Inescapably cancerous behaviour enabled by lack of options and poor game design.10. General optimisationSlowly, slowly, the game crawls towards a reasonable framerate. Running 6700k/1070 I still get dips to 30fps. I shudder to think of people loading this game up with only the recommended specs and not high end consumer gear. Definitely stay away from this game if you don't have an SSD and 16gb or more of ram, and a mid/high end cpu/gpu combo."
44,284.8,Not Recommended," November 3, 2017",6,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWThis game can be great fun. Unfortunately, 90% of the time its utter garbage. If you arent dying to someone with better ping than you or hacks you are running from the zone or enjoying the vehicles that are either abundant or non existent. Did I mention the simple act of going from flat grassland to an actual road can flip your car, if not utterly destroy it?Dont even bother with the hilly parts of the map, as you cant aim up while proned on a hill. Fog maps look like cancer, rain maps kill fps and the game is so horribly optimised that sometimes buildings will fail to load at all. If this happens to you, have fun seeing, and shooting through walls, as well as driving through them.If I didnt properly emphasise it, there is almost always a hacker on every server. Sometimes there are hackers fighting each other for the main spot while you cower in a corner and hope to god that they somehow die before finding you. Aim hacks are bad enough, but speed hacks are plain insanity, impossible to hit and faster than your car. Then there is walls, lower tier aim hacks as well as loot hacks etc that make this game seriously frustrating.To address the better ping thing, Im not talking about just missing constantly and blaming lag. Im talking about shooting and getting blood splats, but not registering hits. Its happened to me both ways, shooting someone 3-4 times while they are running only for them to one shot you with a shotgun, and for none of that damage to register. Inversely, getting blood splats all over you but one tapping someone with a shotgun or headshot will leave you unharmed.Yes, its early access, but that doesnt excuse the company and the shady marketing tactics- look up the relationship between Bluehole and Tencent, you will be surprised.This game has been utterly ruined by hacks and terrible optimisation.

I'm fully aware of the amount of time and effort needed to create and fix games like this, but when useless game features are being added instead of desperately needed anti-cheat, bug-fixes and performance improvements, it makes you wonder how the hell BlueHole even produced the beautiful PUBG in the first place.First 350 hours were solid and incredibly enjoyable.Latter 150... not so much.Until the cheaters are dealt with, it's a no from me.UPDATE: 150 Hours later.The game has only gotten worse.Server management is ABSOLUTELY disgraceful.Incredibly disappointed in the handling of PUBG. I've found the move into 1.0 absolutely disgusting considering the current state of the game.Totally happy to be receptive of negative occurances in early access, but this is a fully released game now.Not an enjoyable game to play overall, however considering the price and its current popularity, it is worth purchasing."

Because anti-cheat is very bad and it gets easily bypassed. They don't seem improve it because when there is cheaters, there is people who will buy the game again which means = more money, more greed?4- Hitreg / hitbox is awfull its worse than R6 Siege (Ye players who play it too know what im talking about. R6 Siege hitbox compared to this is a masterpiece lul)5- Greedy Developers, they prioritize skins first rather than server issues/bugs / perfomance, stability.6- Stay the fk away from this.

64,331.6,Not Recommended," December 25, 2017",6,"This game has a great concpeted and was looking like it had good potential in its EA. However the amount of downs heavily outweigh the positives with an extreme dissapointment from the devs efforts.This game did alright in EA but the main reason a lot of people disliked the game was bescause it was filled with bugs. I expected more from 1.0 than just a new HUD, a new desert map which is extremely buggy and seems unfinished, a death cam so you can watch your bs death again, not many bug fixes and vaulting which is the only neccassary thing that should've been done. The devs are lazy and don't deal with the hackers, the huge amount of Asians playing on Australian servers when they have their own, just make people play in their region!With the amount of copies they have sold they have done an extremely lazy job on the game, with the amount of money they have they can do more. The hitboxes are still horrible and you aim at them and somehow you miss when clearly it should've hit them. The motorbikes still have not been fixed nor have shotguns. Sometimes the game doesnt register the damage properly where I have been 1 shot by a kar98k with a lvl 3 helmet on with full HP.This game can be fun when you don't get bs all the time which happens a lot in this game, espicially with your friends.In conclusion this game has been done poorly, with the amount of money made the devs should be able to do so much more.

114,466.5,Not Recommended," November 3, 2017",6,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWAlright listen up here. I have been playing this game from it's initial release and can confirm is is the best battle royale game out there. In PUBG players with advanced tactics have a pretty big advantage over brainless morons who just rush around with weapons. This is due to the fact that the game starts pretty slow because to become fully kitted you need many things. Anyways you probably know how the game works already so let me get the part you want to hear. In its current state, this game is complete trash. Previous updates I loved this game and had a ton of fun. Ever since the first person update this game has been buggier than ever and filled with just awful vulgar players. You used to be able to get into a game of PUBG on the North American server and have a few people talking cracking jokes. Now the game is just filled with ""China number 1"" and the likes. Over 50% of the PUBG player base are Chinese people. Now listen, I am not racist but the fact that someone jumps into the North American server and the only English words they know are curse words it really ruins the purpose of voice chat. I have had to turn off all talk because of the stupid and annoying players. You either have someone spamming music, someone who can't speak English speaking as loud as they can, or you have some dumbass American screaming the N word.Part 2: There are so many f*cking hackers right now I suggest you not buy the game. I find it very hard to get into a game where there is not a hacker. It is bad when you are getting shot from 700 meters+ consistantly right in the head. I cannot even get a game anymore that doesn't have hackers in it. I have been playing the game since the beginning and it has never been as bad as it is now. If you are planning on buying the game I would advise you wait until the next update.Part 3: In game bugs. The game is buggier than it has ever been excluding the first person update. That update was horrid. Right before first person my friends and I all had really good frame-rates and would rarely lag. The dev team seems to have quit caring about the PC version because now they are getting ready for the Xbox release. Most of my friends cannot even load in buildings for about 15 second right when the game starts. This prevents my teams and I from dropping into any hot zones thus ruining many of the effects of the game. Unless you have a beastly PC I would recommend you wait until a later date to buy this game.All in all: Wait until this game gets fixed because right now it is unplayable.Edit: Hackers have been removed and the new update looks promising."
228,327.7,Not Recommended," November 3, 2017",6,"PROS:- You don't have to rely on teammates. You can play solo or with one to three other friends with equal competitive chances.- Decent graphics.CONS:- Broken promises from developers. Little to no updates. Each update breaks the game further.- Microtransactions in Early Access: Same crate gambling model as CS:GO but in a full-priced game. A darn skirt costs as much as ten copies of the game. Game designed for players to keep paying long after their initial purchase.- In-game advertisements in the form of wall graffiti with famous real-world brand names or even in-menu ISP advertising for Chinese users.- Permanent lag. The game's network runs on a 17Hz at its best, being even worse at the start of the game. Often times the loot won't have even spawned after you've landed. Bullet hits sometimes do not register and the system favours players with higher ping as they can peek you without you being able to see them or they can kill you long after you've gone behind cover because they still see you out in the open.- Literally clunkier movement than games in the early 2000s. You need to rely on difficult to execute 'crouch jump' tricks to be able to jump over the smallest fence. Even the tiniest, invisible rock can flip your vehicle over and cost you the game. [Edit: There's now a 'vaulting mechanic' that allows you to jump over fences and some windows. It's still incredibly clunky.]- Constant crashes whether you're launching the game, in a lobby, or clutching an end-game victory.- Myriad of game-breaking bugs including buildings not rendering for some players so they can see through the walls.- Game favours players with lower graphic settings. Players can disable shadows, even grass to see their enemies better.- Heavily luck-based looting and positioning system throughout the whole match.- Very badly optimized for low-end machines.- Devs care more about twitch streamers and advertising than the actual player base. Players would randomly get banned for ""stream sniping"" even those who don't even watch streams as streamers can simply cry to devs about getting killed in-game with no evidence of other players watching their streams and get them banned.- TONS of hackers in the game, especially since in-game crate drops can be sold on the marketplace, there's immense amounts of Chinese hackers (or even teaming groups) that infest the lobbies. Within a 100 player game there's bound to be hackers. And if you want to win, you'll have to defeat them somehow. Difficult when there's obvious aimbotters and wall-hackers."

574,406.7,Recommended," July 3, 2017",6,"Product received for freeEARLY ACCESS REVIEWI have been following this project from the first announcement tweet ""Player Unknown"" (Brendan Greene) made and I was part of the early alpha testing weekends group. I have been a big supporter of this game and it's community and thankfully this wasn't a dream project of one visionary that crashed and burned.Bluehole studio understood Brendan's vision of the ""Battle Royale"" shooter and helped him create one of today's most popular multi-player games and for a few good reasons.Bluehole is a (mostly) Korean game developer that worked on a MMO named Tera, a popular MMORPG using Unreal Engine 3 and has been pretty successfull in the MMO market. Taking the experience from working on the Unreal Engine in a large scale multi-player and having a great interest in Brendan's game concept they contacted him and proposed the idea of working on a standalone Battle Royale game together.Moving to Unreal Engine 4 was the logical next step and following this game from early alpha tests to the current Early Access phase was amazing to see. The speed of development, updates, fixes, new content and community support have been top-notch. It's thé example for other early access projects to follow and so far they have met every monthly goal and even surpassed some people's expectations with their latest monthly update (june 2017).It's very rewarding to see this game grow every week, fixing the little things followed by a big juicy monthly update that refreshes the game's experience. As of now we still have the new ""vaulting"" mechanics to look forward too and when they add the two new maps they are working on the game's meta will be reborn again and again. Not to mention where this game will go after Early Access is over and modding support is added.The game itself is the pinnacle of the Battle Royale gamemode. It takes the easy to pick up and play from a game like H1Z1 and blends it with a sauce of Arma III-style realism for player movement, weapon mechanics and attachments/gear. It makes the game feel fun and rewarding, making every kill feel like a victory. There's a kind of addicting quality to the game that I don't get from a lot of other multi-player games. Unlike fast round based shooters this game feels like a randomized adventure everytime a new round starts. The stakes are different each time. The loot may be good or bad, the circle on the map that forces the players to move around may be in your favor or that of the enemy.Yes, RNG (Random Number Generation) is a big part of the game, but since the game has the ""Last man standing"" as the win-condition there's a lot of ways players can win the game (and have chicken dinner):-be good at shooting your weapons, know them in and out and what tool to use at what range.-Choosing your battles carefully. Not engaging in a gunfight when you could may be the best way to stay out of danger-Be the best at hiding. A nice bush or a dark corner between rocks may take you to a top 10 spot, if u can stay hidden.-Know how to loot outside the blue circle (damage zone). If you can keep looting and stay healty while the rest is shooting u can outgear them later. It's risky but you could have the upper hand in gear.-When the circle is right you can use the bridges to force players to pass you and create opportunities for traps.There's many in betweens or combinations of the above tactics. having lot's of kills does give you points, but to win the game and get a lot of points you technically only have to kill one. You can play the game in so many ways it makes every round interesting and the game has been my new addiction.And then there's Duo and Squad modes. Playing this together with friends makes it feel like a large scale paintball game against strangers. It's one of the coolest experience when you are coordinating attacks, helping each other stay alive and sharing the butt-clenching tension when you enter the final zones of the game. Bad situations can turn into big loot profit with one kill and sometimes the most desperate situations can still end in a win.Winning a game in Player Unknown's Battlegrounds is one the most satisfying feelings in multi-player gaming. It means you survived against 99 other players fighting for that one last kill. But even if you die early, getting in a new round to try again is easy and fun. I keep learning from mistakes I make and actually feel myself getting better and wanting to get better.At this time we are currently a little more than three months into Early Access.It's an amazing development studio being led by a man who knows what he wants to achieve and one of the best community managers (Poopie Queen) I've ever had the pleasure to interact with. And we have three more promising months to go in Early Access. I feel this project has the ability to become one of the big classic multi-player games, or maybe it already is."

Players have been voicing their opinions on simple fixes across multiple platforms (Lower Plane/Parchuting sound, Get rid of bars on windows) but they seem to fall on deaf ears. The main menu barely works half the time and you have to constantly refresh it. This has been the case for months, but yet blueballs has yet to even acknowledge how bad it is. Loading in and being naked or the bad network symbol flashing on the screen because their servers are so laggy.Again for a game that has become one of the if not the most popular and most purchased games on steam it feels like they are just cashing in.

182,428.2,Recommended," April 21, 2017",6,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWThis is subject to change since it is an Early Access review, but so far I am in love with this game. Years back I played tons of Arma and loved the idea of a battle royale. When H1Z1 announced that they would have it as an offical game mode I was stoked. But like many other Early Access games the developers Daybreak decided to destroy their creation by never patching issues, having barely any updates content wise, and trying to leech as much money as they could. When this game was first announced and I heard it was done by Player Unknown himself, I was excited but skeptical.Pros:+Great dev communication and tons of updates. This has been my favorite feature of PUBG so far, there are updates daily, weekly, and monthly which is paired with stellar dev posts.+Gunplay feels really refined already. Animations, bullet physics, weapons, attachments, etc all play really well and make the gun fights enjoyable.+Realism. Certain aspects such as ammo, armor, attachments, weapons all seem to have realism factored in which is a plus for me.+Matchmaking system actually works and is well polished in my opinion.+It's just fun, it fills the void of wanting a battle royale game. Finally devs decided to create a game with appeal and decide not to derail it for money.Cons:-Servers are not the greatest. There has been multiple instances of servers lagging really hard randomly, or games dropping all together. The latest update seemed to really touch on that though.-Circles and game speed. To me personally the zone moves too fast or does too much damage at times. I don't get too mad because I'm not really sure what a good solution would be to this but something ought to change.-FPS issues. This is probably the biggest one, but like all the other cons the devs seem to be addressing this as I type. The latest update, April 20th, boosted my FPS by 40 in some cases so I am optimistic.Overall this game fills the desire I've had for a Battle Royale / Survival type game, it has been years since a game has had me so addicted. That paired with the quality updates and comms PU has been puting out makes me extremely optimistic for the future of the game."
114,466.5,Not Recommended," November 3, 2017",6,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWAlright listen up here. I have been playing this game from it's initial release and can confirm is is the best battle royale game out there. In PUBG players with advanced tactics have a pretty big advantage over brainless morons who just rush around with weapons. This is due to the fact that the game starts pretty slow because to become fully kitted you need many things. Anyways you probably know how the game works already so let me get the part you want to hear. In its current state, this game is complete trash. Previous updates I loved this game and had a ton of fun. Ever since the first person update this game has been buggier than ever and filled with just awful vulgar players. You used to be able to get into a game of PUBG on the North American server and have a few people talking cracking jokes. Now the game is just filled with ""China number 1"" and the likes. Over 50% of the PUBG player base are Chinese people. Now listen, I am not racist but the fact that someone jumps into the North American server and the only English words they know are curse words it really ruins the purpose of voice chat. I have had to turn off all talk because of the stupid and annoying players. You either have someone spamming music, someone who can't speak English speaking as loud as they can, or you have some dumbass American screaming the N word.Part 2: There are so many f*cking hackers right now I suggest you not buy the game. I find it very hard to get into a game where there is not a hacker. It is bad when you are getting shot from 700 meters+ consistantly right in the head. I cannot even get a game anymore that doesn't have hackers in it. I have been playing the game since the beginning and it has never been as bad as it is now. If you are planning on buying the game I would advise you wait until the next update.Part 3: In game bugs. The game is buggier than it has ever been excluding the first person update. That update was horrid. Right before first person my friends and I all had really good frame-rates and would rarely lag. The dev team seems to have quit caring about the PC version because now they are getting ready for the Xbox release. Most of my friends cannot even load in buildings for about 15 second right when the game starts. This prevents my teams and I from dropping into any hot zones thus ruining many of the effects of the game. Unless you have a beastly PC I would recommend you wait until a later date to buy this game.All in all: Wait until this game gets fixed because right now it is unplayable.Edit: Hackers have been removed and the new update looks promising."

I just got done playing my 8th game in a row in 2 days where my team was killed my a Aimbot / Wallhacker. Yes, I know the difference between a good player and a hacker. Every single time, it's been an Asian player. Every. Single. Time. It's getting worse each day too. I'm now disapointed to say I will not be playing this game anymore until 1 of 2 things happen, hopefully both.1. Latency Lock.2. Much better cheat detection.A latency lock (also need to ban VPNs) would ensure that players from asia wouldn't be able to come to the US servers and hack, which is 99.999% of the hackers. This would also make getting killed behind walls a lot less frequent.Much better cheat detection is obvious and should happen either way.I have many great memories in this game, but it isn't even playable anymore.

Even through I get 60fps constant there is always some random stutters & the frames get worse by each update.2- Server Tick rate, is 15hz or less its really bad and yet they say ""eSports ready"" lol never.3- Cheaters everywhere and always will be hackers, why is that? Because anti-cheat is very bad and it gets easily bypassed. They don't seem improve it because when there is cheaters, there is people who will buy the game again which means = more money, more greed?4- Hitreg / hitbox is awfull its worse than R6 Siege (Ye players who play it too know what im talking about. R6 Siege hitbox compared to this is a masterpiece lul)5- Greedy Developers, they prioritize skins first rather than server issues/bugs / perfomance, stability.6- Stay the fk away from this. The game was fun on the early access but right now its buggy and broken its not enjoyable, having cheaters, random teamkillers because u have better loot and blaablabla. After all my in-game hours, this is all i have to say. just. DON'T."
574,406.7,Recommended," July 3, 2017",6,"Product received for freeEARLY ACCESS REVIEWI have been following this project from the first announcement tweet ""Player Unknown"" (Brendan Greene) made and I was part of the early alpha testing weekends group. I have been a big supporter of this game and it's community and thankfully this wasn't a dream project of one visionary that crashed and burned.Bluehole studio understood Brendan's vision of the ""Battle Royale"" shooter and helped him create one of today's most popular multi-player games and for a few good reasons.Bluehole is a (mostly) Korean game developer that worked on a MMO named Tera, a popular MMORPG using Unreal Engine 3 and has been pretty successfull in the MMO market. Taking the experience from working on the Unreal Engine in a large scale multi-player and having a great interest in Brendan's game concept they contacted him and proposed the idea of working on a standalone Battle Royale game together.Moving to Unreal Engine 4 was the logical next step and following this game from early alpha tests to the current Early Access phase was amazing to see. The speed of development, updates, fixes, new content and community support have been top-notch. It's thé example for other early access projects to follow and so far they have met every monthly goal and even surpassed some people's expectations with their latest monthly update (june 2017).It's very rewarding to see this game grow every week, fixing the little things followed by a big juicy monthly update that refreshes the game's experience. As of now we still have the new ""vaulting"" mechanics to look forward too and when they add the two new maps they are working on the game's meta will be reborn again and again. Not to mention where this game will go after Early Access is over and modding support is added.The game itself is the pinnacle of the Battle Royale gamemode. It takes the easy to pick up and play from a game like H1Z1 and blends it with a sauce of Arma III-style realism for player movement, weapon mechanics and attachments/gear. It makes the game feel fun and rewarding, making every kill feel like a victory. There's a kind of addicting quality to the game that I don't get from a lot of other multi-player games. Unlike fast round based shooters this game feels like a randomized adventure everytime a new round starts. The stakes are different each time. The loot may be good or bad, the circle on the map that forces the players to move around may be in your favor or that of the enemy.Yes, RNG (Random Number Generation) is a big part of the game, but since the game has the ""Last man standing"" as the win-condition there's a lot of ways players can win the game (and have chicken dinner):-be good at shooting your weapons, know them in and out and what tool to use at what range.-Choosing your battles carefully. Not engaging in a gunfight when you could may be the best way to stay out of danger-Be the best at hiding. A nice bush or a dark corner between rocks may take you to a top 10 spot, if u can stay hidden.-Know how to loot outside the blue circle (damage zone). If you can keep looting and stay healty while the rest is shooting u can outgear them later. It's risky but you could have the upper hand in gear.-When the circle is right you can use the bridges to force players to pass you and create opportunities for traps.There's many in betweens or combinations of the above tactics. having lot's of kills does give you points, but to win the game and get a lot of points you technically only have to kill one. You can play the game in so many ways it makes every round interesting and the game has been my new addiction.And then there's Duo and Squad modes. Playing this together with friends makes it feel like a large scale paintball game against strangers. It's one of the coolest experience when you are coordinating attacks, helping each other stay alive and sharing the butt-clenching tension when you enter the final zones of the game. Bad situations can turn into big loot profit with one kill and sometimes the most desperate situations can still end in a win.Winning a game in Player Unknown's Battlegrounds is one the most satisfying feelings in multi-player gaming. It means you survived against 99 other players fighting for that one last kill. But even if you die early, getting in a new round to try again is easy and fun. I keep learning from mistakes I make and actually feel myself getting better and wanting to get better.At this time we are currently a little more than three months into Early Access.It's an amazing development studio being led by a man who knows what he wants to achieve and one of the best community managers (Poopie Queen) I've ever had the pleasure to interact with. And we have three more promising months to go in Early Access. I feel this project has the ability to become one of the big classic multi-player games, or maybe it already is."

Bluehole have done something incredable here, they have made the ultimate adrenaline inducing game since Dark Souls. Sadly, Bluehole have to be one of the most incompetent game development teams ever known! They have no idea what to do with this game, and as a result I feel it is becoming a cash grab before it's even started. The game was doing very well before Brendan Greene (PLAYERUNKNOWN) announced PUBG was coming to consoles, ever since then updates have become lacking in content and consistency. And as I am typing out this review, PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS is guaranteed leaving Early Access by December of this year (2017). I don't know what it is that makes Bluehole think this game is even remotely ready to leave Early Access! perhaps it's the garbage servers, or the endless waves of hackers, or the horrible netcode and server tickrate, but this game is 2 years away from leaving Early Access, not 6 weeks. With all that said, I still find myself playing this game almost everyday! It's as I told you from the start, BATTLEGROUNDS... is my drug of choice."

79,623.5,Recommended," September 6, 2017",6,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWThe Good:Quick connection to servers.Intense multiplayer action ramping up to a finale.Great playing with friends.The Bad:Rampant reports of bad behavior by devs (unwarranted bans, breaking microtransactions promise).Only one map?Unable to spectate match after death.Low FPS.No scoreboard.High purchase price for a 'beta' ($30 as of today).No deathcam.In-game voice uses 'localized sound' to talk to players in your vicinity.3rd person view encourages abuse (use 1st person view-restricted servers to get around this).Statistics wrong (incorrect # of games, # of wins).Some of these would be easy to fix. Team Fortress 2 (among others) supported community map developement, eventually adding some to the game. Spectate could use a delay, so that you could watch the rest of the match after it was over. Server-recorded demos (like CS:GO uses) could be downloaded shortly after the match completed - allowing players to watch game unfold. Add a scoreboard (that's only viewable after game completion - if that's even a concern). And of course, lower the price to $20.Cheers!*After playing for a couple of weeks, I have a few additional comments.There is no real integration with Steam. This means that in-game your friends don't use their Steam name. Outside of the game, you can't invite friends into a lobby or view their score/status. Instead you're forced to go through the limited in-game UI (which constantly needs refreshing). The in-game list of Steam friends also shows everyone as 'offline' - unless they happen to also to have the game open and sitting in lobby. Only then can you invite.In game, there is just about no way to communicate with others. There is no text chat. There is no scoreboard with which to report/friend/view profiles. In fact you can't even see who you were playing against (not even using the Previous Players function). The voice comms are crappy (but not unusuable). They also turn off just before the scoreboard shows. We had a great random join our squad, but couldn't friend him - frustrating!With all that said, some will point to how this game is still in 'early release'. If this were a small-budget game I would totally understand. Currently, this game has pulled in over $300 Mil. in sales. Also, they reportedly have expanded from 35 employees to over 70. This frustrates me to no end.The one saving grace - and it's a big one - is that gameplay is solid. I haven't crashed, I've only glitched 3 times (and was able to quickly get out of 2 of those), and things generally work like they're supposed to."

However, after the most recent update the game turned from sweet to bitter. The player base turned toxic and more than half the players in your match were Asain. This isn't all that bad until you get into game. The Asain player base of course is hard to communicate with since no one understands one another. This is aggravating when I solo que in a squad or duo match and my teammates don't even speak my language. On top of it all, I've noticed an increasing amount of cheating and hacking from the Asain players in my matches. This problem should really be addressed and is as simple as making a region locked servers. Simple as that."

(you still have to shoot someone twice with a shotgun from 10 feet away)You cannot hear the vehicles coming at you until it is almost too late to dodge them.Squad play ALWAYS places me with people who dont speak english and they always stay outside the blue zone and suicide... I don't understand it....You should not be told when you knock out a player, you should only get visual ques because too often players know they knock you out and just run up to you wherever you were and kill you.When in a squad and you get killed you can still talk to your team and tell them where the enemy is. This is a blatant cheat and it is unfair. Apon death players team chat should be shut off right away.When dropping from parachute there is nobody around absolutely nobody falling to the ground or falling with me and within ten seconds of landing and going in the building someone fully kitted blows me away. There has to be a glitch that doesnt show some players fall from the sky.There are hackers in the game, a guy with a handgun blew out all three of my fully kitted team somehow from jumping around us shooting, and someone headshot me with an uzi from like 200 yards magically throught a window so idk....."

I have had so much fun playing this alone, and with friends, with moments that cannot be replicated in other games. I have been willing to put PUBG's flaws in my rear-view mirror, as some, like the car physics, add to the games charm, but the introduction of microtransactions just reveals that Bluehole are just going down the same route as EA and other companies. Instead of the monthly gameplay and feature additions as promsied, we get paid for RNG-loot based cosmetics. Excellent.Please don't give the devs your money for a replica game like this one, other similiar games exist, some of which may even still care about their community. As great as the game is so far, and as talented as the devs are, this is the exact kind of policy that we as a gaming community need to address as a problem and fight by the only means we have access to; where we spend our money."

Started the first game. Houses didn't load when I landed next to them. Googled for 30 minutes. No real solution found. Restarted the game. Game kept crashing for various reasons at least 5-6 times in a row. Had to spend two and a half hours, all in all, of trying various fixes and tweaks. Furious as hell. Finally get to play 2 or 3 rounds, but the cursor in the main menu is constantly ""a bit too far to the right"", I always have to click ""next"" to things. Also, the inventory takes half a minute to load when opening and the game loads for another half minute (freezing completely) when closing the inventory. Have to play on very mediocre and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ graphics.Summary of first day: two and a half hours of bug fixing, 2 or 3 pretty fun rounds.Day Two.Decide to give the game another chance, I googled for around an hour or two to find different solutions. Tried to fix the ""cursor is two far on the right"" issue by turning windowed mode on and off again. Full-screen borderless window doesn't work, by the way. So don't get any hopes up. It doesn't go over the taskbar. Very good mode. Aside from that, the game froze in windowed mode. Main Menu froze entirely, one frame per minute. Restarted the game several times, googled again (about 10 minutes) to find manipulations of the ini file. Restarted PC. Tried many things. Finally, I found out how to set it to boot in full-screen mode again. It booted. First round: The houses didn't load. Tried to open-close inventory, as I read before, and it worked - but it took the game about a minute to continue the process. I was insta-killed. Second round: The loading screen stayed there for 3 or 4 minutes, only to give me an error message that the connection didn't work. Main menu gave a warning message that the round was still going. Tried to reconnect. Didn't work. Third round: The game took so long to load that when it worked again, someone was punching me in the face until I was dead. Instant death screen. Fourth round: The loading screen stayed on again for so long that I was already more or less at the end of the map in the plane. Quickly jumped out, landed - houses didn't load bug. Tried to open-close inventory again, full well knowing that it would cost me a minute, but what can you do. The houses loaded rather quickly (read: it took only around 10 seconds of complete freeze), but one second after closing the inventory, the game froze entirely. I gave it a minute of walking up and down my flat, furious as a million bright red hot suns of burning rage, until I tabbed out. It is currently doing something in the background, I have no idea what. It stopped making sound.Summary.The two or three rounds the universe granted me with this ""game"" were quite fun. It's a shame. But I think I am done.Thank you, you ♥♥♥♥ing thieves, for not giving me the opportunity to get my money back (I mean both the devs and Steam). This is downright criminal, I have no other word for it."

176,58.7,Not Recommended, January 28,8,"PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS (PUBG) got a good and well-endowed reputation, being a major player in the Battle Royale game mode and in the multiplayer section in general, breaking several records over and over again.Due to the massive number of streamers, the game itself is, in my opinion, overrated and overhyped.Using the Unreal Engine 4, PUBG needs a lot of optimisation, even for mediocre-equipped PCs. the massive usage of system resources is understandable due to the fact that you are playing against a number of players mostly ranging between 80 and 100.But even with considering the last point, I cannot understand *why* PUBG is being such a heavy game - after all it is ""just a shooter"" only with a multiplayer mode.The minimum requirements are, at best, a joke. Get a PC like all the streamers and you can get to the top, without having to worry about framedrops when being in-combat or just roaming around on one of the two (!) maps of PUBG.Additionally, the netcode seems broken - servers are unreachable frequently, people bug around the world, shots do not register although you did all the maths to compensate the bullet drop for the distance - or they just do not register at all when shooting in close combat.Buying and playing PUBG since a day in the Early Access time, I have seen plenty of things to create an opinion about the game, not being the best, but a considerably good player in the game.In general the game does not feel finished at all - and for its current price, it is way to expensive to be taken as a serious game, optimized and ""ready for esports""."

Now I can't due to the following reasons:1. Horrible optimization. Months ago, it was acceptable as an fresh-released early access game. However, at this stage, I do not agree that it is acceptable to have the same problems existing for so long.2. Cheating. Battle-eye didn't stop the hackers. Report didn't seem to work. Top leaderboards are occupied by hackers alone. Every SINGLE match you enter will very likely be filled with cheaters.---2.1. Personally, I think this is due to the microtransaction of in-game cosmetics items. As you win/kill in this game, you earn credits. Thus, hacking is actually profitable.---2.2. Developers did not react rapid enough and the situation is not controlled quickly.3. Microtransactions. As mentioned. Honestly I think it's better off for PUBG(and all other games) to ditch the market.4. Developers.---4.1. Absolutely horrendous marketing strategy to attack your competitor directly in media, let alone it's the company that provided you with the game engine.---4.2. Banning people because of twitch streamers said they were ""stream-sniped"". With no concrete source of evidence, this is unfair to all players. Moreover, even if it is the case of mentioned, streamers take the risk to show everything on their screen. It is of their own responsibility to bear the consequences.PUBG was a fun game months ago. I would play it with all my friends, online and in real-life. Every matches were fun and enjoyable. Sometimes you even get to know new ppl who randomly joined your team.That game we once liked is now mostly gone.I sincerely hope the development will turn its directions and head somewhere better, coz right now it's sailing towards an iceberg that sank many good ideas."

9,544.5,Not Recommended, April 17,8,"I was one of the early birds for downloading this game when it was first made public for testing. This game had/has a lot of potential. When it started off the mechanics, and game play design were quite fun and intriguing. However, over the last 6 months, they have taken what promised to be a fun very challenging game, and basically buried it under a pile of money. What do I mean by that? Well let me explain. They have taken a fun game that millions of people have spent their hard earned cash to purchase, and turned it into a game that caters to the cheaters, and hackers. The developers have turned a blind eye to those of us who want to play a fair game. In order to play this game we ALL had to drop a few bucks for the original purchase price which I believe is $29.99. Multiply that my 3-5 million sold, and we have made this company very, very wealthy. Now as with any popular game, the cheaters, and hackers went right to work developing ways to get the advantage over those of us who use actual skill to play. Once they developed numerous cheats, and hacks, they started selling those to the not so honest gamer. Those gamer's then flood the game with their not so covert hacks, and they run around the map using either speed hacks, wall hacks or the most popular no recoil hack. In the beginning it was rare for me to be killed by one of these cheaters, as there were not to many of them. My first experience was with my crew of 4, all of whom are experienced high level 1st person shooter veterans like myself. We have been playing fps together for many years, and have been ranked top in the world on many platforms. That day we were near Severny on the original map, all 4 of us were headed to one of the bunkers just outside of town. Upon reaching the entrance one of my crew was dropped by a head shot from a 45 pistol. None of us had seen or heard anyone else near us. As he yelled into his mic for us to back him up, we all turned to head towards him, that's when we all saw our 1st blatant cheater. This person ran past us moving at the speed of a Dacia at full throttle, and as he buzzed a circle around us, he fired just 3 rounds from his 45, each round striking each of our team in the head. Needless to say none of us were to pleased to have spent the last 30 minutes of our time to get into the top ten left alive, only to have some unskilled looser rob us of a fun time. Now keep in mind we had all played for many hours at this point, and had only heard talk of cheaters, never had we experienced one, until then. Since that day, the number of cheaters have risen to a point that I can say with a strong belief, that every single round played now has 1 to 30 people per round using outside software to enhance there game, to a point that even highly skilled players cannot compete with. Why haven't the developers done anything about this you might ask. Well they have, they have done very little to be honest. They have banned a few million people for cheating already, but it is not a permanent ban, that person can create a new steam account, pay for the game again, and start over. But why would someone want to risk being banned, and then have to pay another $29.99 to get back in you might wonder. Well that's simple to explain as well. The company who created this game gets extra revenue, because they allow the once banned to repurchase another game, so they make more money that way. But its not the only way the company profits from these cheaters. The cheaters play as long as they can before they get banned, which is historically anywhere from a month to 3 months. During that time they rack up massive amounts of BP (in game fake money) that they then use to buy crates in the game. These crates contain skins for weapons, cloths, shoes, etc. Some crates you get, require a key to open them. The only way you can get a key is to purchase one from the company for real currency. Therefore making them even more profit. There is a real world demand for these items, and people sell them on the open marketplace for cash. Some items are worth over $1000 real world cash. So the longer the cheaters can stay in the game before they get banned, the more BP they acquire, and the more money they spend to buy keys. Then they turn around and sell the items they get on the marketplace, and make REAL money. Therefore the cheaters make more than enough to cover another game once they get banned, and the company gets richer. The only losers in this setup are the real gamer's, who mistakenly bought this game to challenge themselves, and to have fun. The Creators of this game have no intention of making it cheater, and hacker free, as that will lower the overall income they get. Lets face the facts,they wont get rich off of the not so honest players like they are now. Don't expect them to do anything more than they already are. They will make a big deal about how many people they banned in the last big sweep of catching cheaters, just like the last 6-7 times they have made this anouncment. But if you notice, and pay close attention, they only do that every few months. That way they give the cheaters time to profit so they can buy back in again before they run another ban sweep. Its all about the money to these people, not a single one gives a (*&^ about the real gamer's. The game used to be a blast, but now its a joke. I know that I, and many others will not waste our money on any games this company puts out in the future. They have proven themselves to be as worthless to the honest player as the hackers are. Don't waste your time, or money on this game. Unless you have low morals and want to make a profit from cheating, then this is a great game for you!"

193,274.7,Not Recommended," September 30, 2017",10,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWPUBG is addictive, no surprise that it earned the title for the most-played game on Steam. It demands a quick adaptability to ingame situations and offers a progressive learning process through playing and discovering the different places.However, there are many issues to be addressed :1. The PUBG developers value recently hit the $4 billion mark. Yet they couldn't fix a common problem despite having earned this amount of money: Game optimisation. With the new updates, they added some new guns and fixed some bugs, nevertheless the optimisation is still low. Even with system specs above the minimum requirements, having stable 60 FPS is nearly impossible, except if you choose to lower settings and run the game with unesthetic graphics.I got i7 and 16 GB RAM, yet I run this game around 50 fps with everything set on high.2. Some issues that bothered me this week were server lags and a not functioning voice chat, which lead unintentionally to uncooperative matches. There was absolutely no communication, which forced the Squad and Duo matches to be done solo. The lags make your screen freeze every few seconds or teleport you back and forth.3. European servers are flooding with Chinese players. Now you might think, what's the big deal about it? When I get matched with Chinese players who don't speak English and only communicate with their nation, while yelling everytime ""CHINA NUMBER ONE"", the games fun factor drops to 0. I really don't understand why there isn't a server lock. The servers have got enough issues, adding the Chinese players with their high latency causes only more unpleasant gameplays.Last but not least, the game is a good time killer, but not worth the full price in its current state. Somehow, during the last 6 months, there was only a sale of $2 or $3, which, in my opinion, is still too overpriced."

188,60.9,Not Recommended, January 31,10,"Playerunknown's Battlegrounds is a Battle Royale Third/First Person Shooter made by Bluemoon studio in 2016 and is currently the most popular game on Steam. The game also has been ported to Xbox One.About the plot, 90-100 volunteers are sent to Erengel Island or Miramar region to take part in a massive Battle Royale (If you never heard of it this is a type of competition where all the contestants must kill each other and be the last survivor, this term was first used in japanese novel ""Battle Royale"" however it became popular when ""The Hunger Games"" were released.) and win a golden chicken... that's it. Kinda dissapointing because I was searching for some hidden history on those maps. Why these areas are abandoned? Is Battlegrounds legal? Who organise it and how did they got so many equipment and vehicles? You will not find anything like this, just some posters and graffiti promoting developers.Every player can dispatch from a plane whenever he wants and land in any place of the map, some time after a safe zone will be set, you must find equipment and get there before time ends, if not your health will decrease. This zone however will become smaller with every 5 minutes, and if you will stay too long in one place you will be bombed, so wise use of multiple weapons, outfits, vehicles and consumables will give you a chance to survive. Sometimes luck is a decisive factor, you never know if someone is following you until you hear footsteps or be shot already. All the fun is about decisions and the risk. If you are smart you already noticed that you can just land near a boat and dive under it till safe zone is not forcing you to stop (first 20 guaranteed).Optimalisation is still not perfect but it was improved since debut in early access, still to achieve 60 stable frames you need to play on lowest settings and textures are loading very long.After every match we receive amount of battlecoins which can be spent on crates. You can open them and hope to get rare item or just sell it on steam market to buy other games (Recommended), 4 types are available, but they are completely random.Steam will not let me to give it a mediocre rate so I am forced to give a negative note. 4,8/10. I admit that it is huge and still expanded, no pay2win or anything but it lacks anything that could keep me for longer, except selling crates but grinding will make you bored even faster.PS:If you are going to buy it, and I know you will because everyone are ignoring negative reviews of this game then you should catch those tips:-Do not wear shoes because with them your footsteps are louder.-Take frying pan everytime you see one, it can reflect up to 3 bullets which makes completely no sense at all.-Using a vehicle is safest and fastest way to kill someone.-First person view is much less safe than third person one.-Shotgun range of fire is not limited like in other games so it is not worse than machine gun.-Hide in high grass often.-Loot drops are not worth the risk.-If you are not brave, hide in water a lot.-Learn to communicate if you are playing duo or team variant.-Good use of your controls will make you land faster when you use parachute."

Views: 151A Tiny Rebview of PUBG, Thanks for watching!! A lot of my recordings were messed up on account of PUBG being a bit sketchy for now, I would have liked more variety.....http://steamcommunity.com/groups/RebusForeverReviews#curationDId you like Battle Royale?Do you like being killed but not knowing why?Do you like having to develop some god tier skills to consistently do well?Then this might be the game for you.PlayerUnknown's sees you pitted against a wall of blue gradual death that stalks you across a huge open map you are free explore and bask in the scale of for the first 5 minutes of the match, after which the pursuing blue wall will politely hurry you along by slowly sucking your soul out should you dawdle.Apparently, so I've heard, there are other people in the game- but often my only source of this information is the post death screen that follows some sudden and untraceable gunfire.PlayerUnknown's is a Battle Royale style game- for anyone unfamiliar with the film, Battle Royale was a feel good rom com that followed the wacky misadventures of a dysfunctional class of school children and their hilarious former teacher on a school trip to the jungle.From there, it's the rom com staple of everyone being forced to kill one another- in this case with nothing more than a supplied backpack of random stuff and whatever they can scrounge- to hilarious and heartwarming effect; rinse and repeat til there is only one person left. PlayerUnknown's is essentially an unlicensed Eastern European themed version of that.The game can be played in a total FFA mode, and also in squads- if you know enough openly masochistic people.Each game of PlayerUnknown's begins with you waiting in the lobby area until it reaches capacity, during this time you are free to walk around and interact via voice chat with the other players, giving everybody a good opportunity to participate in civil discourse, wish one another the best of luck or exchange tips and advice.......Once the lobby fills the game begins.For some reason, the devs decided to begin the game with an American Airlines passenger simulator giving you the option to disembark the plane within a set time or removing you by other means if necessary.You begin empty-handed, once on the ground scavenging is the order of the day and then the killing or hiding begins in earnest.The map is huge, to prevent camping and force player interaction (see killing), the map begins shrinking in stages, if you chute down in the wrong place you may well find your only challenge for the game is staying inside the playable area.There is a wide variety of weapons and superficial items littered around with a number of vehicles also added to aid with mobility.Each game continues until there is only one player left.After each game, you earn some nonsense, game specific currency you can also spend real money on, that allows you to buy lootboxes that might contain a superficial item you might be interested in; the random, almost abusive nature of the loot purchase system, matches the feel of the gameplay perfectly.(I spent all of my time in FFA mode for context.)I simultaneously enjoy PUBG, suck at it and think its a little over priced.The games performance is patchy- most of the time when I die I don't know why.I've only made it into the top 10 a handful of times, the devs are now apparently banning people for killing streamers with claims they are doing so without just cause, but if you can pick it up for half price sometime (and have the patience of a saint) PUBG might be the grieving engine for you.Thanks for checking my review!!"

17,881.4,Not Recommended," December 20, 2017",16,"My issue with the game isn't with the game itself - it's with the cheaters. For those that don't know, there's an entire community of hackers exploiting the cheap Chinese price tag of the game to farm wins through scripts and hacks. They usually turn a profit off the BP through the Steam Market, thus they keep doing it. I get the logic of mass bans, but the only way to make this cost ineffective is to ban them instantly, or at the very least implement the region locking we've all been desperately crying for, without prejudice. Allowing it to continue sends one message and one message only: ""Screw the genuine player base, as long as we can generate illigitimate profit and can artificially inflate our sales numbers, who cares about the people actually trying to enjoy our game?""Since it wouldn't be fair to raise the price of all Chinese sales from $5 USD, effectively punishing everyone for their bad apples, region lock. It's not xenophobic, as PlayerUnknown seems to think; it's a necessity to fix the same major problem that ruined H1Z1. And it needs to be done before this game destroys its own community.I'm not talking out of my butt here. This is 600+ hours of my own experience with Discord servers as a top 1% player. They lobbies are dead compared to what they used to be. Those that remain are constantly making known how frustrated they are with cheaters. In a last-man-standing game, the cheater will almost always win. When they don't, they ruin the experience and actually provoke serious racial tension. This game is quite literally a race war in its current state. Knowing this, a lot of the competitive scene is starting to migrate to other games. Myself included."

Pubg is so much more fun than H1. I cant stop playing it. I encourage people to try it because everything about it feels better than most battle royale games. Optimization is probably the biggest issue. I got lucky im currently running it on ultra (1070, i7 4820k) with the biggest problem being the cities.

269,75.5,Not Recommended," July 3, 2017",62,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWThe game is fun. It's even more fun if you play with friends. I predict a bright future for it if it continues to be worked on and proceeds to an actually playable experience.Although, I can't honestly give it a thumbs up, not yet at least. I know it's in Early Access and all that jazz, but the price is too high for an EA game with multiple issues all across the board.The game is buggy and unoptimized, would crash a lot, greedily use up any ram it can find and refuse to free it up after closing, forcing me to restart my pc each time.The game would crash each time on load until I took down GPU and CPU overclocks. Then it would crash 3-5 minutes into each match until I moved it to SSD. And even now it would crash from time to time. With a lack of reconnect option it always means waiting for your buddies to finish each time it happens.It uses 100% gpu (even IN THE LOBBY), but then still drops frames, stutters and lags a lot, no matter the settings. I have frequent drops below 30fps in 1440p on a fairly decent rig (i7-4790K+gtx1080+32GB DDR3), but from what I've gathered the performance is pretty much identical on my way less powerful htpc (i5-4460+gtx970+8GB DDR3). Once a popup came up saying the game sensed network issues causing lag, even if I have a really stable 100/100mbps connection that never gave me any trouble before. My bet is it'd because me and my brother were playing over the same lan connection and a single instance of the game uses enough of the bandwidth to smother the performance all across the network (so I wouldn't organize any lan parties with PUBG if I were you).I'll revisit this review later on if the issues are fixed, as I'm definitely not yet done with the game."
504,10.5,Recommended," December 21, 2017",893,"I apologize for my bad English. Thanks to Google for translatе my letter (review) :)Dear PLAYERUNKNOWN, I am writing to you from a distant cold north-western part of the Russian Federation, or, more simply, from the Republic of Karelia. My name is Andrey, I'm 22 years old. I became one of your big fans after playing in your modification to the game ArmA 3, I mean BattleRoyal (I apologize if I wrote the name of the mod slightly wrong, there like all the capital letters, but I unfortunately do not remember, played a very long time). Then I believed, and still believe that this is a breakthrough in the gaming industry, a regime where hundreds of players are released to the open terrain, where they have to kill each other with what they find in this locality. And this mode is called Battle Royal, it's cool, isn't?Thanks to you, I decided to learn more about the setting of the Battle of the King: I watched two parts of the film of the same name, and all sorts of trash American films, like ""The Condemned"" and ""The Hunger Games"", read a couple of books where deytvie occurs in a similar genre, in general, was not boring. I learned a lot of things about survival in different conditions. Maybe someday it will come in handy, but I hope not. Thanks for this.And now, perhaps, I will go to the root of the problem, because of what I'm just writing this review. Rather, when you were an ordinary mod designer, I would not write about it. But now you have a serious company, and on the sales of this wonderful game you earned, I'm sure a lot of money. So, buy more servers, and if possible, put them in Russia. I put the search game, waited 10 minutes, got angry, went to the grocery store for an hour, came back, and, wait for it, the game is still being looked for! How i must understand this?! I spent 1/20 of my salary on your game, but I can not play it, because you see, it's not looking for a game. And yet it is badly optimized: in main menu at the low graphics settings I have a slide show. Correct, please.I hope you will see this appeal to you, or I will have to return my money, sorry.Sincerely, PyaoFacer"

218,131.7,Not Recommended," December 25, 2017",5,"It's PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS! What more can I say?The title literally SAYS IT ALL IN OBNOXIOUS CAPITAL LETTERS!BodyBeing a veteran of Playerunknown's popular Battlegrounds versions and titles from the very early stages when it was first released as a mod on Arma3, then H1Z1, and now to this. I can say that I very much like where the genre is going and what it has become. Overtime it has learned from it's failures and success's but in saying that, there is still a LOT that needs to be improved, fixed and completed for 'PUBG' to become recommended from me. At this point in time the only reason that I would recommend for anyone to purchase this game is so that you can play with your friends because for some reason, everyone has this game (AKA everyone saw their favourite streamer play this game).I worded that exactly how I did because the game itself is horribly optimized, has servers that use the raw power of a single toaster to run, and contains players from outside of their region abusing the lag compensation and ping issues to get an advantage on other players.And I haven't even started on the graphics. I needed a new paragraph dedicated just for that. The graphics in PUBG are insanely awful to the point in which I wish I could press 'F' to jump out of a plane in real life. After about 50 metres (or 54.7 yards for y'all) the game loses tons of visibility and ""high quality-ness"". Even playing on the MAX settings, Club Penguin back in 2010 had better graphics (I'm not kidding). There's an anti-aliasing option with multiple different settings but I am completely convinced that the game doesn't include anti-aliasing at all yet. When playing for a few matches or after a decent period of time, you can sort of look past the fact that the game looks like trash and begin to enjoy yourself a little bit but you probably shouldn't play for much longer after that as your eye sight most likely would be completely destroyed by then.The 1.0 ""RELEASE"" update saw the addition of a 'desert' map, more optimization and new UI as just a few of the main features and changes that were made. Just like the reviews of this game, I had mixed feelings about it. The new desert map was a nice thing to see as it allows for a fresh environment, different strategies and different vehicles but unfortunately this update has also made the original map a lag fest. The games' optimization on the other hand was good and they have done a nice job with the current direction that it is going in but there is still a lot more optimization needed before I would consider it to be in a releaseable state. The UI is probably the one thing that I liked the most about the update as it features a modern, clean, easy-to-understand design with good contrast between the different colours that the game includes. All in all I don't think that the game is near a releaseable state and instead should have been kept back in Beta.If I had to give an official rating for this game out of ten, I would probably rate it a .I give it this rating because although it is a great game to play with your friends, that's all it really has going for it currently. Maybe through improvement, changes, the power of god, and anime on their side, the game can redeem itself and become one of my favourite games in my library. But until then, this is my review."

Once the game is RELEASED the overall review will be edited to reflect that.Please for the love of everything that is holy, keep in mind that this game is in early access. Complaining that your $400 laptop won't run an unoptimized game well enough is not a valid complaint towards a game. It's not. It's only valid if they don't deliver on the product. It just released as a product a couple days ago.OverallThis is my first trip in the battle royal genre, so I wasn't entirely sure what to expect. I'm thankfully fairly happy with what I did get. Spawn with 99 other people, listen to them spew obscenities, get thrown into a plane and then jump out of it to the island below. Once you land, do your best to run around and find equipment, including guns and armor, to help you survive against the other players that have also dropped in on this island. However, you will be forced to move closer to each other as a forcefield will slowly over time close in on the map. Don’t stand on the outside it though, otherwise you’ll die and that’d suck. Keep yourself inside the bubble and kill everyone that moves (unless it’s your friend) in an all out… battle royal or survival of the fittest or whatever you wanna call it. Prepare to be incredibly tense and hype when things go down.This game is entirely PvP and plays a lot better with friends, so if you don’t have a stable connection to play on, or are looking for something to play offline, this game is NOT for you. There is no story.Yeah, it is. Performance is hit and miss and I do feel like weapon variety can be improved.Going into what most people are looking for, I’ll talk about performance a bit.Intel i7 4790k @ 4.4GHz1070 Founders Edition16GB of DDR3 @1866MHzI’m running on average at around 45-60 FPS, unless I’m in a spot that has a lot of buildings. Then it can drop to around 20ish. While a whole lot of information hasn’t been provided, there are some steps that they have said they will take to help fix this performance.Basically, a lot of the performance issues have to do with a massive load on the CPU, and LOD (level of detail) being too high on buildings that are too far out in the distance. These are known issues across many, many video games and especially in the Unreal Engine. This is a totally fixable issue, and the team at Blue Hole has done this before with their previous titles.-All battles are incredibly tense. You have one life and you have to make it count, and a lot of the times the game does its best to make sure that you’re the one at fault for dying, and not an issue caused by the game, something that other games in this genre, or in the overall FPS genre as a whole seem to have.-The map is huge and easily provides enough room for the maximum 100 players to explore and gather enough equipment before attempting to engage other players. One of those things that’ll be hit and miss depending on how many people decide to jump out where and when, but it seems fair enough for the most part.-Despite what I’ll say below, the community for the most part isn’t full of a load of bums. That’s a huge bonus for making sure that you’ll be able to enjoy the game if you’re the first to die or not. Of course there are bad apples, but overall I’ve had a good time with them, and the randoms I’ve been paired up with have always been cooperative and fun. Keep it up guys.-The game and the people behind it are incredibly community driven. They are listening to what people are saying and fixing issues based on what people are saying. Another point that goes into this is that they do want to allow modding, and seeing as it runs Unreal Engine, the possibilities for modding in this game are HUGE. If added, this games lifespan would grow tenfold.-I think my main complaint right now is that hit registration from time to time does seem to be off. This could be because thousands of people are loading the servers right now, or that the servers potentially have a low tickrate. This is something that can be certainly fixed, especially if they do it along performance updates.- There are some problems with the way vehicles interact with the environment. There have been quite a few times where I’ve been driving and have hit something I can’t see, or tried to go up a hill that’s clearly climbable and ended up taking damage because of it. Possibly my fault, but I do believe a lot of it has to do with the fact vehicle suspension appears to ride too low.-This is iffy, but the community is always spewing out obscenities, and some people don’t like that. I don’t mind it, and have kind of come to appreciate it in a weird way. This will vary between person, I suppose. Don’t take it offensively, just laugh and perhaps talk some smack back.Gather some friends and get ready for some fun. At the moment, it’ll be laggy for quite a few people, but in regards to a lot of the other early access titles out there, this one is quite complete. Be prepared to get upset when you get shot in the first five minutes of a match, and prepare to sweat for those times when you make it to the last ten and the play area is absolutely tiny. It’s all up to you to try and find the tools you need to survive, and put yourself in a spot where you can take control of any situation that is put in front of you. You’ll have a lot of quite time to explore the map and gather pieces to prepare for fire fights, but never EVER let your guard down, because danger can be around at any time. As my first journey into the battle royal genre, I’m incredibly happy with my $30 that I spent, and I imagine me and my buddies will be clocking many hours into this game.Seeing as I haven’t played any of the other games in the genre, I can’t say that this is more complete from experience in comparison to the other titles, but from what I’ve seen this seems the most functional and least frustrating. Blue Hole has a good amount of experience working on video games, mainly on the title TERA, and they have experience with the engine. If you’re unsure due to performance issues or anything right now, they claim to want to be out of EA within 6 months. You can wait.Stop wanting numbers off of reviews. Read some stuff on it, take a look at some videos. The best judge is yourself. If it looks interesting to you, you’ll probably enjoy it.I paid for this game with my own money, played and streamed it on my own time with no obligation from me or the developer. Everything was on me."

And it turned out the guy he killed was a streamer who then reported him for harrassment.That guy reported him and my friend was banned.This is insane. The devs need to stop babysitting streamers.Streamers should either accept that streaming introduces the potential for sniping (Especially if they are stupid enough to have their twitch URL as their name).Or they should add a stream delay to counter it.Streaming is a risk you take and other players and the devs shouldnt have to change how they play or babysit you because of it.Until the devs address this issue and stop banning people for incredibly minor things because a streamer threw his toys out of the pram I will not reccomend this game"

It's crazy when you realise that in every game you're being hunted by squads that consist of 9 or more people. In the last game I observed a squad of no less than 15 people all wearing the same coloured shirt and driving a number of vehicles just hunting legit players.I love the concept. It's just a shame there are people petty enough to take the fun out of it.I will not continue to play this game sadly.

21,216.4,Not Recommended," October 19, 2017",5,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWAs someone who usually doesn't review games let alone post feedback. I have to say I need to this time.The game is in early access so I can understand some of the issues, however, their biggest one which is around server stability is as simple as going on AWS and upgrading their nodes from all the funding this game has received and purchasing 1 or 3 year tiers which will save them some money even though the severs will cost more than they are now.The lack of communication from the company minus a few things here and there isn't cutting it.Now for the people crying about being banned for ""stream sniping"" I seriously doubt that many people are actually getting banned for it(I feel like some got caught cheating and use that for an excuse). As for the hackers I have seen my share of them and unfortunately it exists in every shooter and probably always will. Patch it you say?! It is far easier to reverse engineer the hotfixes to their anticheat and make it undetected again than it is for the team to figure out how the code is being injected into the client.In it's current state unless you have a high end rig dont bother. There is no way an average rig let alone a console(LOL) will be able to play this except at the extreme minimum and it'll look ugly. I will recommend this game when it actually gets out of early access and Bluehole gets their head out of their Blackhole and makes this game much better."

In theory, this is amazing, as you could work together, cooperate in beating enemies and make bonus friends! However, in practice, 80% of the time, you are matched to a 100% Chinese speaking team. This means, unless you speak mandarin, you will be severely limited in groups, as nobody will speak any English. Furthermore, because you don't speak mandarin, your team may decide to just kill you, for fun (this actually happened). It does not matter whether you select EU server, NA server, you cannot find a way to team up with people who speak actual English (obviously that was expecting too much on a EU/NA server).I have played around 10+ group games now and no matter which server you pick the groups you are matched with are almost always entirely Chinese. If you don't speak mandarin, you cannot run 2 or 4 man squads in the battleground because your team will not understand you / mock you / be racist / kill you."

I have played Arma 3 KoH and DayZ in the early days, so I have some items to compare it to.I will be honest, I have had 5 crashes in the last 9 hours, but it is in early access so that is to be expected. That being said, for such an early access game it works really well. The gameplay with looting and moving to new zones works pretty well. I wouldn't say it is perfect, but a lot of items are good.Yesterday in a squad we went gunblazing from a car behind another squad in a car dodging trees and houses. Awesome. Actually all sessions are good and based on being rushed or not you can have a new gameplay experience everytime.Pros:- Nice map- Looting is pretty balanced- Shooting feels genuine- Weather effects are niceCons:- Car physics are a bit wonky- Both 3rd and 1st person.

142,60.3,Not Recommended," December 29, 2017",5,"Imma get straight to the point, save your money and get FortniteHeres why PUBG sucks:Major Con, extreme amounts of looting in this game makes the game staleWhen people play PUBG unfortunately they feel the need of having mods, gear, helmet, vest, meds and boosters in their inventory ARE necessary for their ability to play due to the wide variety of items and upgrades that can give you a mild advantage so naturally people want to take advantage of this and only engage when they have the right items which is fairly smart if you want to win however looking at the wide scope of things the amount of different items your going to want to have is huge for a battle royale game encouraging looting over fighting causing a stale gameplay experience. if someone goes into a building and finds an M16 with some ammo, instead running and gunning and actively fighting others they will pick it up and go ""ok now I need a scope for it and a helmet and a vest and some meds and boosters and a stock and a silencer etc etc"" and ONLY after they loot all these items they are ready to fight. So what you get is at the beginning of the game, unless you are an active running and gunning player with that kind of mindset you will get absolutely stale gameplay running across the map and looting which in my experience takes up about 80% of a match. Although looting is an important aspect of any battle royale game, the primary focus of the game should be actively fighting each other and not looting! Even 20-30 minutes in people are still going to be looting beacuse of the extra little upgrades you can still get such as a level 3 vest compared to your level 1 or a silencer instead of a compensator etc, the wide variety of different items and modifications you can get has made people specifically go for and want to loot even more thus how the game is intentionally or unintentially primarily focusing the looting aspect of PUBG and giving people this looting mindset of disengaging from fights and finding more loot makes a stale match. This is what makes PUBG boring, a hiding and running looting fest, the only parts of an average match which I genuinely find exciting and fun is either in the final few circles where everyone is out there to find and fight each other which I admit really does get my adrenaline pumping or at the very beginning, landing in a highly populated area where there is an active threat and looting takes as a secondary focus. Unfortunately these heart pumping moments where I feel like im scared for my life only take up no more than 20% of the game if youre lucky, the rest of it is a boring, stale, unexciting loot fest.The looting system and the way people play Fortnite is much simplier and honestly so much more fun. This is because of the lack of items people deem necesarry to fight with. The moment you land in fortnite and you see a green shotgun for example (a relatively common item in the game) is all you need and your good to go and can literally run and gun around the area and engage in killing people with no problem. Sure there are other items in the game that can come in handy but not nearly as much as you would need in PUBG as you dont necessarily need a shield potion for the early game or even possibly end game of fortnite at all as I've won many matches without it and meds dont have nearly as much of a severe impact on the game as in PUBG as typically fights are much more close ranged giving bandaging up in fights almost futile. All you need in fornite is a decent gun and youre okay, no silencers, no scopes, no armour pieces, no bullsh*t.This is what makes a battle royale game fun.-PUBG is notoriously poorly optimised, even players with good PC's exceeding the system requirements have unenjoyable performance issues. Fortnite runs perfectly if you meet the system requirements.-PUBG is $40 NZD compared to Fortnite being free-Biggest Battle Royale Game out there, huge community almost everyone owns it so it can be a good conversation starter for those awkward moments irl if the other person has played or even heard of PUBG (likely) :)-Turning in a questionable Esport??-Made my money back from selling crates although I owned the game for a while now when the Gamescom Crates came out and selling the normal cases at a higher price soo-Hard to think of many more pro's and con's :P leave comments down below of any and I can easily edit this post :)"

The devs do not actually care for the player base, too, evidence is that they added in crates in the game-when promised they will not have them until after early access, they ran advertisements on Chinese clients on PUBG for a VPN service (source), then Player unknown (AKA Brendan Greene) has the audicity to call his player base as 'xenophobics' for saying that Chinese players are causing a problem, which if you think playing in server where more than half the players have above 500 ping in a FPS game(along with statistics from their anti-cheat system saying majority of banned players are chinese-), then I'm not sure of what to tell you. I don't recommend this game until the devs get a sense on how to treat their consumers, obviously they do not care at all because, well, we're already giving them money so why should they? Unless their source of money starts to fade, they'll stay in this area of ""Who really cares about the consumers? They'll pay us for anything at this point, the idiots."" type of mindset.It hurts me to think that Player Unknown kind of sees us (Not definite, but deduction of given evidence) this way, but you can't hope for problems to be fixed if you don't attempt much. It's a fun game, I enjoy it. I don't recommend more people to get this game though, try the alternatives first and see if you like this style of a game, and maybe wait until the PUBG corp shows that they really do care for us.You can search my points I made and there should be articles that I originated them from.I most likely made some errors in logic or grammar.*edited an error in parantheses and replaced a statement"

Maybe this is just more noticable now with the kill cam. Things such as no recoil and no sway rather than the obvious aimbot and headshot abuse.I cannot recommend this game in its current state. However, I do feel that with time many of the issues I listed will be fixed."

It's addictive, and you know it's awful, but you keep trying because maybe one day it will be better...But sadly, the developer cares more about adding new content than fixing the broken content that already exists. The new map (Miramar) is terrible, feels like someone just went ape♥♥♥♥♥♥with a terrain elevation tool randomly creating cliffs that bounce you off the side and kill you instantly from falling when you go anywhere near them. Instead of addressing player complaints about framerates, lag, textures, widespread cheating, disconnects and crashes, the dev has decided to implement loot boxes that require keys - you guessed it - that can only be purchased with real money. The game is being sold specifically to the ""esports"" market, and it's not even functional (spectation mode is ♥♥♥♥ing abyssmal, good luck trying to watch the action through the seizure-inducing stutters). This game should never have left early access, and to call it a ""full release game"" makes a mockery of the whole industry.Download Fortnite instead; that battle royale mode is free, and at least it actually works."

I have to say I need to this time.The game is in early access so I can understand some of the issues, however, their biggest one which is around server stability is as simple as going on AWS and upgrading their nodes from all the funding this game has received and purchasing 1 or 3 year tiers which will save them some money even though the severs will cost more than they are now.The lack of communication from the company minus a few things here and there isn't cutting it.Now for the people crying about being banned for ""stream sniping"" I seriously doubt that many people are actually getting banned for it(I feel like some got caught cheating and use that for an excuse). As for the hackers I have seen my share of them and unfortunately it exists in every shooter and probably always will. Patch it you say?! It is far easier to reverse engineer the hotfixes to their anticheat and make it undetected again than it is for the team to figure out how the code is being injected into the client.In it's current state unless you have a high end rig dont bother. There is no way an average rig let alone a console(LOL) will be able to play this except at the extreme minimum and it'll look ugly.

The concept of a battle royale game sound fun and intreguing, but the execution of it is cery poor. There is a destinct lack of polish in the game that really brings it down. Also the lack of rewards makes the game boring to play after a while of playing single. The rewards are too forgetable and unsatisfying and the fact that now you need to spend money on keys to open some of the crates creates another problem that leads me to lose interest in the game. There is also a lack of game options. The game is based on a battle royale concept, but that doesn't mean it should be limited in terms of options you can make. You can't even chose between maps letalone specificalities that you can have in other games like a certain gun type can be used or an option to chose the time of day."

Guess what? Hitboxes registered when i hiding behind the wall, damage received eventhough behind the stone wall...... Ridiculous.Round 3: Jump off the ramp from flying plane, using parachute to land on Island smoothly, saw 2 players beat each other while they're just arrival, with weird clunky melee animation, prior to landing i joining fist fight too, then he landed one punch on me.... only one punch.. that left me half gauge of life meter... i meant what sort of punch will left the player half to death? Mike Tyson/ Mayweather Punch?

BattleEye tweets that they can ban upwards of 40,000 hackers a day. FORTY THOUSAND!!! You would think that PUBG devs wold take action? Nope! PUBG devs can easily region lock Chinese players & hackers on their own server to try to minimize the plague on the community.. But they choose not to. PUBG devs ignore all the facts & evidence and blame ""xenophobia"" for players wanting a region lock. Yes, you heard that correctly, ""xenophobia"".

25,207.2,Recommended," December 8, 2017",5,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWBy: PatrickSPlayer Unknown's Battlegrounds has been blowing up lately. Breaking records on steam while still being in Early Access.Now let's start with the core gameplay of PUBG. You drop out of a plane on a large island with 99 other people. While looting the island and all its buildings you'll be forced to stay within a certain area called the Player Zone. The Player Zone get's smaller and smaller during the game. Since loot is spawned randomly games will have a certain factor of ""luck"".The graphics in PUBG look great if everything is maxed out and the map is 8x8km which is rather big. However unfortunately the map is pretty boring. While roaming the island and looting your way through it, you'll come across loads of attachments. These make looting a lot more interesting. Now you have a reason to keep looting once you have a gun, armor and some medical supplies. Deciding what place to go next takes a bit of strategical planning, would it already be looted? Where will the player zone move to? Do I use the car or do I go walking so they won't hear me? Etc.Player Unknown's Battleground is rather buggy. The game doesn't have the best optimization and has a lot of buys/flaws. You can't climb/vault at all, putting your gun to a window and peaking doesn't work great and loads of other small bugs. Now don't get me wrong, the game does get updated and new weapons get added from time to time, but they honestly should focus on fixing the bugs a bit more.Now why is Player Unknown's Battlegrounds receiving so much negative attention? It's due to a couple of reasons. First of all, the bigger your game gets the more people you get that dislike it of course. Second of all, the developers broke a couple of promises. They've promised us there would be no micro transactions during Early access, yet here they are. They've delayed the vaulting update 3 times now, they're calling out and threatening other Battle Royale games for copying PUBG, banning people who kill streamers with the reason ""stream sniping"" & they're not really fast on fixing updates and bringing out new content.Does this mean Player Unknown's Battleground is a bad game? No. In fact it's a great game, and although it's a bit boring if you play solo, the game is great and one of the better Battle Royale games out there at the moment. It's a blast with friends and before you know, you have been playing for hours. Looting until your loadout is perfect and sneaking up on players is really fun and killing enemy's is satisfying for sure.Overall, if you're looking for a good Battle Royale game, Player Unknown is a great option. Just be sure you like the slow paced gameplay. If you're not entirely sure if PUBG is something for you I can highly suggest free variants like Fortnite."

You name it!I see many reviews complaining for cheaters/hackers, low optimization and I get it but common which game is not full of those?Just give some more time to the developers and let them do the job which they are doing completely fine. Managing such high pressure and responsibility from the gamers community is tough!Coming towards the game, this is the best game I have ever played till date, period.PUBG gives an overall experience of third person shooter, first person shooter, survival, right amount of exploration and looting and the ambience/environment is just right!The game gets super fun when you are playing with your friends and you just have a great time playing the duo and squad matches.It's also great to play with random strangers, getting to know them and befriending them. I have managed to make 5 new awesome friends out of playing duo/squad matches and planning to make more!Community is super good and supportive.Here's some of my gameplay videos which are super easy to make with the support of Nvidia Shadowplay. Love it!Can't wait for further updates, optimization, community support, modding and the DESERT map!If you are in for a great shooting, intense, fun, battle royale game, PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS is the perfect game for you!"

The game still has memory leak issues.-Hitboxes seem to be pretty bad.-Short range combat feels kinda odd. In one case 2 shotgun hits to the chest doesn't do anything and in the other case 1 clear shotgun hit to the chest is a one shot kill.-It is an early access game, so there is a risk it will never be truly completed.Overall this game is great, even with all its current issues and even if playing solo, but it is even more fun when playing with a friend or two."

370,65.4,Not Recommended," August 14, 2017",7,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWIt's a fun game, and it has a lot of potential, but the netcode is garbage. Half the time bullets don't even come close to hitting near the crosshair even at close range. Also, BlueHole has already implemented microtransactions which they claimed they wouldn't do. While they are only cosmetic, knowing BlueHole can and will go against their word leaves me no choice but to worry about what they may decide to do in the future. If you're not worried about the political side of game development and just want to play, go for it. PUBG isn't the most optimized of games, but it can run on a fair selection of hardware configurations given that you aren't afraid to turn a few settings down. The inclusion of First-Person only servers does an excellent job at keeping the game fresh while giving you a more realistic sense of terror as you scavenge for weapons and search for shelter. Overall, I'd say this game is worth your consideration, but think hard about whether or not this game is for you. Like other battle royale styled games, the formula can and will get old with time."

82,153.4,Not Recommended, February 12,5,"This game is just a buggy mess. It ruins the whole aspect of combat. The combat and gameplay in general feels very clunky and not fluid. There are many glitches and attributes that indicate to an unfinished game that contribute to the sometimes frustrating experience. It is fun in most cases, but when the glitches happen, they are very frustrating to deal with. The game is fun, but I consider what is a good game more to be fun. The concept of a battle royale game sound fun and intreguing, but the execution of it is cery poor. There is a destinct lack of polish in the game that really brings it down. Also the lack of rewards makes the game boring to play after a while of playing single. The rewards are too forgetable and unsatisfying and the fact that now you need to spend money on keys to open some of the crates creates another problem that leads me to lose interest in the game. There is also a lack of game options. The game is based on a battle royale concept, but that doesn't mean it should be limited in terms of options you can make. You can't even chose between maps letalone specificalities that you can have in other games like a certain gun type can be used or an option to chose the time of day."

The first is the fact that there isnt any grass at long distances so it makes it easier to see opposing playes. The second is the fact that I cannot run the game at a solid 60.After playing for a long time this game sadly is being plagued with poor developer choices leading to a half baked mess launching out of early access. If you are reading this review the you know the new map is getting all kinds of love and they do deserve the applaud. This wouldnt be a problem if they could also fix the game they are developing while they add new content. It is a game that will be great if it doesnt get abandonded after its release, which seems probable since they have stated they will be focusing on cosmetics only after release and because they are already working on a new game which is an MMO...Overall I say save your money and play fortnite which is by far a better version of this game."

Hacking is nothing new to online gaming, but when it gets out-of-control, and the developer CHOOSE TO DO NOTHING about it, then the game becomes unplayable.For the past six months, this game has been plagued with hackers; mostly from China. BattleEye tweets that they can ban upwards of 40,000 hackers a day. FORTY THOUSAND!!! You would think that PUBG devs wold take action? Nope! PUBG devs can easily region lock Chinese players & hackers on their own server to try to minimize the plague on the community.. But they choose not to. PUBG devs ignore all the facts & evidence and blame ""xenophobia"" for players wanting a region lock. Yes, you heard that correctly, ""xenophobia"". Google that too (PUBG & Xenophobia).So rather than region locking the game or aggressively going after hackers, the PUBG devs have chosen to call millions of their own customers xenophobic, and allow hacking to run rampant.*If something is done to fix this issue, I'd love to return to playing it, and I'd be happy to recommend it."

This is to be expected though in these type of MMO/MMAS games. I would say i've only ran into may a dozen or so since 1.0, compared to 1 that I'm aware of pre launch. Maybe this is just more noticable now with the kill cam. Things such as no recoil and no sway rather than the obvious aimbot and headshot abuse.I cannot recommend this game in its current state. However, I do feel that with time many of the issues I listed will be fixed."

Ghillie suit is also a cosmetics item and who could vouch that none of the cosmetics items that they are currently selling would not have as much impact as having a ghillie suit in the future?They could even broke a simple promise and justify it by saying that they need to test it so who knows what they might do next?Don't get me wrong,I do not support stream snipers and stream honkers but to ban them because some guy somewhere thought it was a good idea to let the whole world know what game he is playing and where he is currently seems rather stupid to me not to mention the fact that there maybe some innocent players are being accused of stream sniping and stream honking and getting banned because of it.You as a player put yourself in that situation so please do not whine about it.It is not as if somebody pointed a gun at your head and asked you to stream live I mean if that was the case please contact the police whenever possible.Seeing as how they could afford the time to ban Stream Snipers,Stream Honkers and others you would have thought that they would have banned all if not most of the hackers yet there are still hackers freely hacking in the game which makes me wonder what do they place their priority on?In my opinion, most games get better and better after every single updates but for this game it is currently getting worse and worse after every single updates.This is my advice and you do not have to follow it just like players do not have to stream to play this game.For those that have already purchased the game my advice is to get those crates and sell them so you could get back the money you paid for this game and for those who have not gotten this game my advice is your money is worth more than this.There is a reason why the recent reviews is Mixed from Mostly Positive."

It is now even better and it is getting better with every update.It captures the genre perfectly and Player Unknown and his devs are actually standing behind their product.Yes, it is not optimised for lower end PCs, (i am using a 1060 and i5 6600k no issues, aside of the starting area), there are still areas where you can get stuck (scaffoldings and the lumber mill that i know of), landing the parachute is still janky af at times.I have yet to win a solo game, with only one win to my name in squad, however this has provided soo much fun and adrenaline over the past 2 weeks that i'm gonna keep playing it regardless.Worth it - if you like the genre DEFINITELY !"

75,101.4,Recommended," September 10, 2017",5,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWSo...!! Here's my review after 70 hours or so of gameplay.> The idea behind this game is actually brilliant and very interesting. I bet you will love it, even the from the first match.It's one of the very few games, that get your heartbeats up...! You FEEL the game, as you are one of the last few players alive.> The gameplay and game mechanics (physics etc) are actually pretty close to very good, with a few minor tweaks and changes that need to take place and as I heard, ARE taking place in the upcoming patches.( For example, you can't kill people under water, and you can't climb over certain walls that look ridiculously short. :D )The driving physics need to be a bit refined too. Other than it, it's a solid game even in its current state.> It has a good enough range of weapons and armor / equipement to find and use in order to survive, BUT (!!!) they are far from many... This game could seriously benefit from even more weapons, which honestly, are NOT that hard to add....> The map size is GIGANTIC. And walking from one side to the other is kind of impossible in one match. :D You will probably have to use a vehicle.> The Graphics are pretty good. More than good actually, but the game is pretty hungry in terms of computing power.I run the game on Ultra Settings @ 1080P using a GTX1070 and an i7 4790K, but one of my friends can't even run the game at low with a pretty average PC.To be honest this game is great solo, and even better if you have a team to play with (up to 4 player Squads) and although certain changes could make it even BIGGER, it still is great and enjoyable !!!I would tottaly recommend it !== End of Review ==Now if ANY Devs are reading this by any chance, the game could easily benefit from more weapons and maps, (actually as I heard a new one is on the way), it could also, easily have a forced ""no HUD"" mode, and compasses to navigate. It could also have a smaller sized map mode (like BF does using the same maps.)More things can be made to this game to make it a KILLER experience for players."

146,260.3,Not Recommended," December 14, 2017",5,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWWorst Game of 2017 Award.CONS:The concept is simple and exists since the beginning of times. Greene calls ithis ""trademark"".

LIE #3We have an XBOX release that runs like♥♥♥♥♥♥before anything was fixed in thePC version. But PU needed some sweeteasy cash ya know.Most mobile games have better netcode. PUBG runs at ~15hz tick. Not evenclose to a enjoyable tickrate,and lightyears away from a competitive environment.That means you're gonna kill people who are behind cover(on their screen) and vice versa.With so many copies sold, they dont have to prove anything anymore, andprobably just gonna milk it to death. Now we have 2 maps that dont work.The new one is incredibly boring.The controls and inventory mechanics are ATROCIOUS.PROS:The weapon variety and attachments are fun, while I think they should spawn everyweapon in the map,the airdrop mechanic is kinda boring, and just adds unneccesaryrandomness. You dont need them really, because you can win every game with M4+UMP.Its incredible funny to play in a squad, but thats gonna increase the chance of one bugging out.The simple Battleroyale concept makes every game intense, and winning more and moregames can be really rewarding.CONCLUSIO:After 250h I cant shake the feeling of utter dissappointment, and that PU himself is aphony - I mean he's still trying to let everyone believe he invented the battleroyale mod- wich exists atleast since ancient rome days. I dont think he had an original idea ever,and PUBG shows that.It can be alot of fun yeah, and might get better in the future, but i can only recommendit if you're really really really into Battleroyale games. If not, there are much better gamesout there for your time."

Not sneaky, ""Oh he might not be cheating"" people, but blatant, never going to get banned, speed hacking, aim botting, cheaters.If you look at this games forums on Steam, it is nothing but adverts for hacks. Apparently they sell well. 1 in 10 games are enjoyable.Updated Review. There's a rating system. Appearently I am fairly high rated, 2016 rating and top .05%, in NA. At this rating, without any form of embelishment to this statement. Out of the 100 people playing per match, on the NA servers, 70% of the players will have Chinese names. Of the 100 people playing in the match, at the very least 10 will be blatantly cheating. We're talking Aimbot, wallhack,speed hack,esp, shooting through mountians(I am serious), cheats.The kicker to all of that. The company BlueHole will lightly acknowledge it's happening, those reports you spend your time doing on said cheaters, useless. Those people may get banned, and if they do, they will have purchased the game, made a new account, faster than I will have typed this. Nothing of any substance is being done about cheating in this game. Nothing. In fact, the newest update as of writting this, will give even more incentive for people to cheat. They cannot fix this problem, even in the slightest, but they will try and sell you crates and keys, and butt♥♥♥♥ the cash right out of you.Avoid this game. I'm going to go so far as to say, any product put forth by BlueHole, and or Brendan Greene should be avoided at all cost. These are nothing more than a low rent attempt at devolpment, and a high rent attempt at milking every single dime they can out of every single customer they can, with absolutely no designs to ever make any of their products enjoyable in the long run.The Cherry on Top: According to the games co-creator Brendan Greene, if you ask for ping/server lock, you are a xenophobe.

In the last few days, i had 27 games, and in 23 of them me, my friend and my team found people using atleast 1 phorm of hack, mostly speedhacking and macro abusers.Sorry, this game is not recommended.

633,599.2,Not Recommended," August 14, 2017",5,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWThis game is fun, and I enjoy it a lot. Or at least that was the case. As this game has risen in popularity, so has the abundancy of hackers on OC and AS Servers. 7 wall hackers in under two weeks, getting one shot with a single Uzi round, even tonight, speed hackers two games back to back. I just don't understand this ""Hush Hush Nay Say"" culture this game has. You talk with other people, and there is always someone calling you a liar.Sometimes buildings take a long time to render, allowing people to shoot through walls. People actively exploit these bugs, but that is not what I am talking about. There are people doing these things 10, 20, even 30 mins into the game. I only call it, if I know 100% that the target does not have even the potential for a line of sight and they hit me without missing a shot. I'm honestly not sure what the devs are doing about this. The problem is getting worse each day and it seems that the devs care more about taking your money than stopping hackers. There are MASSIVE flaws in this game that are just not getting dev attention.Hacker rant out of the way, when there are no hackers, this is a thrilling game, everyone is a hunter being hunted by real players. Outsmarting, outpositioning, outplaying, even just psyching out a player netting you a kill or a narrow escape is a great feeling. These aren't stupid AI opponents, but clever (arguably sometimes) human beings constantly learning and adapting to the many situations and possibilies. Each players play style is shaped by their personal experiences of trial and error, and fatal mistakes. Apart from exploiting the game itself, there are no exploiting AI due to the lack thereof. One tactic may work on one person, but the next may have seen it before and knows how to counter it when you try it on them. Now you know how to counter it for when someone tries it on you. Now you can think of ways to counter that counter. It is a game about survival, evolution and of course, Chicken Dinner.A lot of fun, but in its current state, as an Aussie player experiencing many hackers and bugs, I can't recommend it. To people who live local to servers that AS players do not go on, go ham. Fun game."

126,844.7,Not Recommended, January 20,5,"The concept is great, which is the reason why I've been playing it half a ton of hours, but the actual execution of it is very bad:-full of bugs (vehicles, movement, crashes)-not enough servers; too many players in a match so the servers lag like hell until there are 70-80 players left.-animations are bad-hit registration is bad-infested with cheaters, which definitely ruins the experience since it's a permadeath game with no respawns-very bad graphics (double-layered flashing textures, overall look)-the higher ping you have, the better chances you have winning a battle, because it at least feels like hits happen client side-loot system is terrible, no way this'll ever be near ""esports ready"" -status. Random weapon spawns are way too random-a game that is mostly about luck has a matchmaking system to match you with players in the same skill group. Good job. (not)-melee weapons are terrible-ballistics are terrible after the update. 7.62mm bullets act like 9mm, not realistic. And yes, I've been to the firing range a lot with both 7.62mm snipers and 5.56 AR-15. The bullets don't drop like that, and they're faster. I wish they removed the 'air drag' component because it really made a lot of the weapons feel like airsoft guns-performance issues in cqb gunfights (3930k @ 4,1GHz, 1080Ti, 16Gb ram) removes a lot of the FPS skill aspect-Miramar, the map, sucks. It made the already slow game pace even slower, since the loot is worse than in Erangel, so now people just loot even further and die to the zone (which is buggy as hell in miramar and is 95% in the southern half) because they didn't even get the meds to drive that 4km. And they die with ump and a crossbow with lvl 1 armor. So, less action and less fun. Just even more slow loot, driving and dying.-the zone is done very badly. Sometimes the first area is 50% in the ocean, and often in Erangel the last few zones are 50% in the water between military base and the main island. The whole zone should be reworked.-you still can't choose the map-they removed fog and rain, even though the only thing needed to do was to lower the 120dB rain volume, and add a tick box on whether you wanted to play those weathers or not.-the game has the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ name I've ever seen on a game. Even the first alternative name that comes to my mind, Chickenbattles, is a lot better. If B. Greene had a nickname ""SKULLKILLER69LEET"" this game would have a ""SKULLKILLER69LEET'S BATTLEGROUNDS"", with the caps lock of course. Who the hell names a game like this? Did you even try? 5/5 for selfsufficiency.Something to emphasize: I'VE HAD MORE FUN WITH L4D2 with my friends recently, which I have played thoroughly years ago. Why? Because it's made by a GOOD GAME DEVELOPER, and IT WORKS HOW IT SHOULD, and IT REALLY IS GOOD IN ALMOST EVERY ASPECT, and IT DOESN'T LEAVE THE TASTE OF CRAP IN YOUR MOUTH WHEN YOU PLAY IT.I wish that a real game company with a lot of skills would've made PUBG, so it would be fun to play. It'd have more interesting details in it, the game would work, minor bugs would get fixed faster etc. The gameplay feels clumsy, sticky and not very responsive. It'd have more depth and better mechanics. For example, to make 2-seat bikes less op vehicles, they should have the driver/passenger fly off and get knocked if crashed into a wall of another vehicle. Now it's just about luck who gets the bike to be the first one to loot the best area.I'd propably have a ton of other negative things to say about the game, since I've played this to the point of nearly uninstalling the ""WASTE-OF-HARD-DRIVE'S SPACE"", but this is all I can come up with in 15 minutes.#waitingforabettergamewiththisconceptEDIT: The more I play this utter piece of **** there more I hate it.GET THE MAP CHOOSING OPTION AND FIX YOUR GARBAGE GAME!!! IT'S SO FRICKING COOL THAT ERANGEL FREEZES THE GAME IN THE LOADING SCREEN EVERY TIME AND YOUR STUPID SOFTWARE SKILLS MADE THIS GAME BE ON TOP OF TASK MANAGER AND I HAVE TO OPEN ANOTHER DAMN DESKTOP TO GET TO THE TASK MANAGER!!!GIVE ME ""K"" GIVE ME ""Y"" GIVE ME ""S""!EDIT2: I decided to delete this game from my PC for a while just because this caused nothing but misery with the countless bugs, stupid and badly implemented mechanics, physics and revolting game design.

A lot of them cheating smart and staying dormant till the last stages of the game. Believe me or not is your choice.2. Too many tickets PUBG support cannot cope withAnother BS. I have worked in game support before. Every time we have too much tickets to process, we have just outsourced a part of them to another company to reduce the burden for in-house support dep. Considering how much money BH gets for selling PC copies and after entering into Chinese market, outsourcing part of the tickets to third-party is not an issue at all with all these resources they have right now.The only reason they do not do it and not interested in solving hack software and cheaters issue is money flow. Everyone is happy:- Devs getting money from copies;- Creators of hacks getting money from renting their hack software for 30$ per month (more or less);- Cheaters (if they smart enough) getting money from selling crates and getting joy by owning you in every match. Also, there is a tricky way to own you and lose nothing after account is banned in the process. They are buying a new game, playing with cheats on, then refunding it using 2 PCs before it gets banned, then cycle repeats;- Lucky draw sites getting money from crates and loot lotteries;- ""Helpers"" - getting money after selling stolen Steam accounts (you can see messages in Chinese starting with 解封, that means ""help in unbanning your account"", if you stupid enough to believe them, you will lose your account).You, player, the only loser in this game, unless you cheat as well.0/10"

Even sat at traffic lights in your car, you never want the car who pulls up next to you to beat you off the line.Battlegrounds is a game that has found meteoric success over the last few months attracting millions of bloodthirsty players ready to fight to the death, but not all of them want to play by the rules. Depending on who you ask PUBG either has a serious hacking problem that affects every game or cheaters are barely noticeable, rare unicorns witnessed every one hundred games or so. Whichever side of the fence you sit on, PUBG has banned roughly tens of thousands of hackers in the last three months, so they're certainly out there. You may very well have played with a hacker, but the truth is you'd never know it, if the hacker slowly stalked you using ESP, an ability that grants the cheater extra sensory perception of your location at all times. You'd just think you were unlucky. You can't win every game after all.Hacking communities are notoriously secretive and for obvious reasons, but this often leaves their motives shrouded in stereotypes. Common opinion paints them as vindictive children with too much time on their hands and a penchant for mischief, but surely they can't all be like that? Some of these hacks aren't cheap.So back to the game....FPP or TPP?My opinion on FPP vs. TPP: First off I prefer FPP over TPP. When it comes to watching I prefer, to watch FPP. The reason being is gameplay is more exciting. You can play more aggressively, higher kill games are more common. Gun skill becomes more a factor. People have to take risk to gain information in FPP, you can't just sit behind your cover and see everything that is happening around you. You have to understand when to peek, what directions to be watching. You can snowball fights, If I engage someone in FPP and damage them heavily, they either have to turn to fight me, or retreat to cover. If they retreat to cover they’re now blind to my movements, I can flank them, reposition and attack them from another angle. The enemy player after being caught off guard, or losing the initial engagement has to understand where I can move on him. He either needs to predict my movements, or take a risk to gain information by peeking, and then responding accordingly. If that same scenario happens in TP, as soon as the guy gets to cover he is safe. He can med, he can see all my movements, I can't push him. It becomes a stalemate. Whoever moves first more often than not will die in this situation. Gameplay is slowed down, and aggression is halted. There's way more action in FPP that's why I prefer watching it. There's a ton of game sense that comes into play in first. Since you don't have some camera floating up behind your character, with a super wide FOV. When it comes to what one is more skilled, both require a large amount of skill to do really well in at the highest level. At the end of the day when it comes to the more skilled mode, I have to give it to FPP though."

When the shots come together ace, but when you and you team put nearly every bullet into someone and they kill you well not so great, luckly those days are fewer but still occur. The net code is obviously still needing some fine tuning.The game really started well for me as a whole.But now we have the big problem and the bit, in comes the paid drops. I'm not a fan of any gimics, I saw this a solid FPS with out all the stupid kiddie rubbish.For me this sat perfectly between arma and bf.A big player base etcBut why do developers have to ruin something with drops.Let's face it were are early access testing and for doing this testing we have already paid around £20 quid.As soon as you start with gimics you loose me.If it continues this game will just be another game in my steam library I don't play.I want to have fun but also a little bit of seriousness.Do I recomend it, well its now at MEH level.."

126,844.7,Not Recommended, January 20,5,"The concept is great, which is the reason why I've been playing it half a ton of hours, but the actual execution of it is very bad:-full of bugs (vehicles, movement, crashes)-not enough servers; too many players in a match so the servers lag like hell until there are 70-80 players left.-animations are bad-hit registration is bad-infested with cheaters, which definitely ruins the experience since it's a permadeath game with no respawns-very bad graphics (double-layered flashing textures, overall look)-the higher ping you have, the better chances you have winning a battle, because it at least feels like hits happen client side-loot system is terrible, no way this'll ever be near ""esports ready"" -status. Random weapon spawns are way too random-a game that is mostly about luck has a matchmaking system to match you with players in the same skill group. Good job. (not)-melee weapons are terrible-ballistics are terrible after the update. 7.62mm bullets act like 9mm, not realistic. And yes, I've been to the firing range a lot with both 7.62mm snipers and 5.56 AR-15. The bullets don't drop like that, and they're faster. I wish they removed the 'air drag' component because it really made a lot of the weapons feel like airsoft guns-performance issues in cqb gunfights (3930k @ 4,1GHz, 1080Ti, 16Gb ram) removes a lot of the FPS skill aspect-Miramar, the map, sucks. It made the already slow game pace even slower, since the loot is worse than in Erangel, so now people just loot even further and die to the zone (which is buggy as hell in miramar and is 95% in the southern half) because they didn't even get the meds to drive that 4km. And they die with ump and a crossbow with lvl 1 armor. So, less action and less fun. Just even more slow loot, driving and dying.-the zone is done very badly. Sometimes the first area is 50% in the ocean, and often in Erangel the last few zones are 50% in the water between military base and the main island. The whole zone should be reworked.-you still can't choose the map-they removed fog and rain, even though the only thing needed to do was to lower the 120dB rain volume, and add a tick box on whether you wanted to play those weathers or not.-the game has the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ name I've ever seen on a game. Even the first alternative name that comes to my mind, Chickenbattles, is a lot better. If B. Greene had a nickname ""SKULLKILLER69LEET"" this game would have a ""SKULLKILLER69LEET'S BATTLEGROUNDS"", with the caps lock of course. Who the hell names a game like this? Did you even try? 5/5 for selfsufficiency.Something to emphasize: I'VE HAD MORE FUN WITH L4D2 with my friends recently, which I have played thoroughly years ago. Why? Because it's made by a GOOD GAME DEVELOPER, and IT WORKS HOW IT SHOULD, and IT REALLY IS GOOD IN ALMOST EVERY ASPECT, and IT DOESN'T LEAVE THE TASTE OF CRAP IN YOUR MOUTH WHEN YOU PLAY IT.I wish that a real game company with a lot of skills would've made PUBG, so it would be fun to play. It'd have more interesting details in it, the game would work, minor bugs would get fixed faster etc. The gameplay feels clumsy, sticky and not very responsive. It'd have more depth and better mechanics. For example, to make 2-seat bikes less op vehicles, they should have the driver/passenger fly off and get knocked if crashed into a wall of another vehicle. Now it's just about luck who gets the bike to be the first one to loot the best area.I'd propably have a ton of other negative things to say about the game, since I've played this to the point of nearly uninstalling the ""WASTE-OF-HARD-DRIVE'S SPACE"", but this is all I can come up with in 15 minutes.#waitingforabettergamewiththisconceptEDIT: The more I play this utter piece of **** there more I hate it.GET THE MAP CHOOSING OPTION AND FIX YOUR GARBAGE GAME!!!

110,101.0,Not Recommended, January 1,5,"Product received for freeLet's face it, no one likes losing. Even sat at traffic lights in your car, you never want the car who pulls up next to you to beat you off the line.Battlegrounds is a game that has found meteoric success over the last few months attracting millions of bloodthirsty players ready to fight to the death, but not all of them want to play by the rules. Depending on who you ask PUBG either has a serious hacking problem that affects every game or cheaters are barely noticeable, rare unicorns witnessed every one hundred games or so. Whichever side of the fence you sit on, PUBG has banned roughly tens of thousands of hackers in the last three months, so they're certainly out there. You may very well have played with a hacker, but the truth is you'd never know it, if the hacker slowly stalked you using ESP, an ability that grants the cheater extra sensory perception of your location at all times. You'd just think you were unlucky. You can't win every game after all.Hacking communities are notoriously secretive and for obvious reasons, but this often leaves their motives shrouded in stereotypes. Common opinion paints them as vindictive children with too much time on their hands and a penchant for mischief, but surely they can't all be like that? Some of these hacks aren't cheap.So back to the game....FPP or TPP?My opinion on FPP vs. TPP: First off I prefer FPP over TPP. When it comes to watching I prefer, to watch FPP. The reason being is gameplay is more exciting. You can play more aggressively, higher kill games are more common. Gun skill becomes more a factor. People have to take risk to gain information in FPP, you can't just sit behind your cover and see everything that is happening around you. You have to understand when to peek, what directions to be watching. You can snowball fights, If I engage someone in FPP and damage them heavily, they either have to turn to fight me, or retreat to cover. If they retreat to cover they’re now blind to my movements, I can flank them, reposition and attack them from another angle. The enemy player after being caught off guard, or losing the initial engagement has to understand where I can move on him. He either needs to predict my movements, or take a risk to gain information by peeking, and then responding accordingly. If that same scenario happens in TP, as soon as the guy gets to cover he is safe. He can med, he can see all my movements, I can't push him. It becomes a stalemate. Whoever moves first more often than not will die in this situation. Gameplay is slowed down, and aggression is halted. There's way more action in FPP that's why I prefer watching it. There's a ton of game sense that comes into play in first. Since you don't have some camera floating up behind your character, with a super wide FOV. When it comes to what one is more skilled, both require a large amount of skill to do really well in at the highest level. At the end of the day when it comes to the more skilled mode, I have to give it to FPP though."

239,69.7,Recommended," July 6, 2017",7,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWTL;DR - Game has a long way to go, but it's still awesome as-is and devs are working hard (and communicating well) to make steady progress. Very intense fun while alone, totally awesome with friends. Would absolutely recommend in current state.I'm thoroughly impressed with PUBG. I didn't have high expectations coming into it because it's an early access shooter (so I expected a lot of bugs and whatnot) but I've heard a lot of good things about it so I took the plunge. I think it's well worth every penny. I've had some serious adrenaline rushes playing solo, sitting in a bunker listening to enemy footseps outside, but I've also loved playing with friends in duos and squad mode. Nothing like army crawling up a hill next to your buddy while some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ pounds lead into the hill around you but you're almost to the top and your heart is beating and oh there goes the guy over there, I'm gonna have a heart attack at this rate. :DPROS:- Runs decently without major bugs (for me, YMMV depending on your specs). Haven't had any problems besides the occasional weird bug and voice chat (see cons).- Gameplay feels juuuust right. Stages of the game (looting, moving, hunting players, etc) don't pass too quickly. You're given ample time to get going in the beginning and the gradual death wall progression keeps things exciting without forcing you to rush too much.- Variety of neat weapons, accessories, and armor. I like that you can't break down items (H1Z1) or otherwise destroy them for other players without taking them for yourself. You can't horde guns, helmets, etc. Helmets, vests, and backpacks are all one of three levels of increasing benefits. Loot seems appropriately generated, with high value items being fought over by many in the military base while secluded houses hold smaller guns (with the occasional treasure).- Vehicles, apart from a few quirks (the motorcycle does a backflip if you go to set it upright again???) seem surprisingly stable and easy to drive. It takes a few minutes to get a feel for it but if you've played GTA or something similar you'll probably agree that the controls feel natural.- A decent amount of customization items. Not much yet, but enough that you can have your own look. Most are super cheap on the marketplace, but you can get crates for currency (that you earn playing, no cash currency here thank god) that give items. I'd like more but it's hardly important, I'm just an online fashionista. I do like the fact that they make sense in the setting of the game, it's all rugged jackets and jeans and caps and stuff that fit the characters and their environment, nothing crazy like a clown mask or some♥♥♥♥♥♥- BattlEye seems to have been a very good choice for anti-cheat. I haven't encountered any (apparent) hackers yet and they seem to be banning those that do, according to forums and whatnot.CONS:- I can't get in-game voice chat to work. I disabled it after my first match (nothing but fools screaming profanities on the plane) and haven't been able to get it working on team only after that. I can't hear teammates and I can only speak for a few seconds before it cuts out. This is the only major bug I've encountered but no one I've talked to has had the same problem.- Being early access, the game isn't very optimized yet. I'm getting a pretty stable 60 fps on low settings but I encountered problems on high settings. It seems that only high-end builds are really able to run this to its fullest right now.- There's currently no replay or kill cam of any kind BUT THEY HAVE SAID THEY'RE WORKING ON IT. I'm eagerly awaiting that update because I feel like there's sometimes just no closure when you die. Some nerd on a hill can headshot you from meters away and you'll never know because you just fall over dead. I'll update this when they get it added though.- Could use some more content (additional maps, new weapons, etc) but that's all being worked on and added. Only even bothering to include this as a con because some folks might prefer to wait until there's more variety (I for one am happy as it is though, but to each their own). Go look at Player Unknown's Twitter (@PlayerUnknown) for info on what the devs have going. There's a new gun coming in the next month or so and they've got a desert map in the works."

One effective fix would be to region lock. It's sad the devs won't region lock since the Chinese players are the most egregious cheaters. The devs know the largest percentage of cheating players are Chinese, the players know this to be true, everyone knows this to be true, but yet the devs do nothing about it. The new reporting system doesn't seem to stop the cheaters. They just keep coming back. Nothing will change until the money stops rolling in and the PUBG company gets scared they are going to lose on this.

This game is a first-person shooter and players should have to maintain a certain level of ping in order to be competitive with other players. The current number of Chinese players playing in the North American server are hands down destroying this game through their ridiculously high ping which give them a Competitive Edge. Then there's the white elephant in the room that 90-something percent of cheats out there originate in China and are used by the Chinese players. Pubgs Creator knows all of this but is unwilling to upset his cash cow which is China and uses sjw self-righteousness as a Smokescreen to allow Chinese players to play on in North America at our player base's expense. All in all this used to be a great game and in the future I would advise anyone to avoid anything that this developer touches unless you just like being milked for dollars."

79,42.9,Not Recommended," September 15, 2017",17,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWWhere to begin? Well, to be honest, the game can be fun if you approach it the right way...This is my first ""Last Man Standing"" game, which doesn't exactly mean much when its still considerably new in relation with games such as H1Z1 and Rust. Personally I regret having gotten the game when I did, which was about late april, at the time it was poorly optimized and almost unplayable even though the CPU and hardware that I had far exceeded the minimun requirements to play the game, but thats enough salt from the past. The reason I wouldn't quite recommend this game is because even though I have had a bit of fun I think that it still has a really long way to go before its worthy of hard-earned money being wasted on a sub-par experience. Let me explain, I'm not much of a fan that the outcome of the game can be accurately measured from the first 2-10 minutes of dropping in due to RNG, which I do understand is part of the fun, but I want there a bit more of a closing of a ""skill gap"" I don't really like dropping in and because someone was lucky enough to find a weapon in the house they run into it results in me dying 0.45 seconds after having landed. Also, it may be me, but the sounds and its quality seems to be a little off, whenever I play gunfire seemingly comes from the opposite direction and throws me off a bit, which, to be fair validating the files has helped in the past and i've made habit of doing so after every update. However, going back to my argument about luck, I don't like the fact that most of the deaths I encounter don't seem to really be my fault. I'll admit i'm most definately not the best player, i'd describe myself as exceedingly average and i'm not ashamed of it either. But, i'm not exactly sure how people are able to shoot through solid objects or throw grenades at impossible distances and sometimes even hit me at a range that is also impossible with the weapon they have with or without the proper sightings. To keep things ""brief"" this game can be fun, but it has a long way to go before its worth your money. If I were to put a rating to it...6/10."

283,82.6,Not Recommended," July 8, 2017",3,"1.0 Release: Just as bad as it always was.------------------------------Original review:It runs quite well on my rig, so i won't complain about optimalization issues. However, the servers are just garbage. Issues with hit-registration and such are rampant. Sometimes even opening a door can be quite a challenge.The game mechanics themselves work well, the gunplay is great, the vehicle physics are okay for a game like this, looting and the inventory system are straight to the point. Character movement is responsive enough, never felt like I failed because of a crappy camera or way too long animations and such.[SOLO-ONLY EXPERIENCE]Now, my biggest problem with this game lies at it's very core, the battle royale mode. In the first few hours, it was very satisfying to get into TOP10, or at least TOP30 most of the time, but that initial sensation wears off quite fast. Then, the realisation comes, it's all about luck and RNG, especially in the last few minutes of a match. Anyone who isn't the last one alive is considered a loser, doesn't matter if you are 2nd or 99th. If you aim to survive as long as possible (which is the goal of the game), it gets quite demanding physically and mentally. You have to listen to noises made by other players, force your eyes to notice very few pixels in the distance, sneak around, be all tactical, plus the anxiety because you have only one chance per round. This is a drawback because the amount of energy invested doesn't get reflected in my fun-o-meter or ingame rewards.First, it can get quite boring, since most of the time nothing happens until the end of the round.Second, this type of gameplay contradicts the impression of ""just hop in and play"". And why is that impression? Because there isn't any kind of progression system, gearing, or anything involved outside of matches that would affect the actual experience. Press a button, get thrown into a lobby instantly, and go.If you just glide down to the most populated areas to have some fast action, the chance of getting killed fast is quite high. Wasting around a minute in a lobby and another one until you reach ground just to die maximum five more minutes later, rinse and repeat do the same thing over and over again isn't so much fun either in the long run.It might be able to give me a totally different impression if I'd join premade 4-man squads, but playing solo is just...meh.EDIT: I've tried a few rounds with both premade and random squads.It's a bit better and less chaotic, due to the fact that getting shot at by someone from somewhere doesn't result in an instant death, but only a knockdown. This leaves much more room and time to respond to the situation both for you and your teammates. However, dying in the first few minutes is a pain in the butt, because oh boy spectating for the rest of the match, which can take up to 20-25 minutes is just a no.And the rewards...everyone gets less than half of the currency compared to what solo offer, which is really contraproductive in an online game.Apart from all this, the reason why i give it a thumbs down is because of the price/value. I'm aware that it's early access, but I'm going to rate a game by it's current state. Promises and such isn't going to cut it anymore, too many negative examples from before.At this point the 30 euros pricetag doesn't feel in par with what the game provides and how it provides. A single map, and a single gamemode, with a little bit of character customization, that's all."

44,237.6,Not Recommended, January 23,20,"After you've started playing this game you are having sometime fun. But mostley this game is a waste of time.The gameplay:You start playing and wait a minute untill the game starts. Than a plane is crossing a map and you choose when to go down. As there are up to 100 players you need to choose your start area carefully.If you choose the wrong area (a hotspot with a lot of weapons), you might die immidiately without finding a weapon. Yes there is a option to clear a spot. If you do so, you feel very cool. But this is even for good players just working out sometimes. So expect at least three bad games for one cleared area.The other option is to go somewhere into nowhere. You will run around and search weapons. Mostly finding crap. You do this for 5-10minutes. Sometimes you will get killed why doing this from your back. If you are a guy who loves collecting crap, this is probably the best way to play this game. I think this just suck. Running around and searching crap for up to 10 minutes is just bulls**t for me.Lets suppose you finished this and you are still living. You need to move always to be in the living zone. An intelligent way to move is helping you to pass to the endgame. This kind of gameplay is really okay.At the end everybody is camping somewhere as long as possible. If you want to win you need to hide and save your armor and helmet for the very last endgame. If you don't do this your position will be known by the enemys around you. If you are in the endgame you might get a higher pulse, because you spend so much time and so many f***ed up games into getting there. This is really cool at the beginning.Getting a win over a lot of other players makes you feel very cool and strong.However this game is probably the most successful online game ever. There are so many fanboys out, who love this game more than anything else. That's why I would say, you should test this game, if you have too much time and you are searching for an alternative to your main game. Especially if you are loving to run around and collect stuff, this Shooter is the right thing for you.For me all the gamesessions in the past weeks, ended in hating this game. It honestly was a waste of time. I don't like collecting stuff. I hate the RNG in this game. I hate the engine problems. I don't like the map. I cannot accept that a company with so big open cashflow still don't give us the possibility to customize the games. But maybe you are another kind of gamer. So if you have time and money test this game.I am suggesting to play CS:GO, if you search for a new multiplayer shooter. Yes there are also cheaters. But the chance of having a cheater belong 5 opponents is way lower than having a cheater belong 99 opponents. Also CS:GO is providing many more gamemodes. It is customable. There is way less RNG. The beginning is hard, but it's worth all effort.Thanks for reading!"

533,27.4,Not Recommended, April 4,16,"I don't follow gaming trends for a reason. Rarely do I ever get up to date on what gaming's new frontiers are like, or whatever nonsense companies will try to do next to make a quick buck. PUBG is no exception.I won't claim to be an expert in the Battle Royale genre. It has never appealed to me for a reason. But one day I decided to fork over my own money to see why the hell gaming seems to be headed this route. The answer does not please me. Even more disappointing than Red Faction II. Have you ever played that game?Immediately right off the bat, there is an noticeable disdain for Chinese players, and even China as a whole. Not surprising since they make up 99% of the hackers, and sound so damn obnoxious whenever I hear or catch anyone play it in the NA servers. As a Chinese person myself, I am ashamed I belong in that subgroup, and could be labeled as such. Deplorable behaviour in a multiplayer game, but what else is new?Randomly generated loot means the game is one big luck of the draw. All you found was a bandage and Med Kit but no guns? Sniped by another guy who has 8x scope. Think you're hiding in the grass? Grass only has a certain draw distance, so snipers will easily pick you off like flies. Let's not forget the hackers also, because this game wasn't fun enough already ().So the game's tauted as realistic, eh? Is that the only reason people seem to be chewing this garbage up? Right, and I suppose Ride to Hell: Retribution has great motorcycle physics too. And don't tell me the game is fun either, because it really isn't.Look, I'm obviously the wrong guy to cater this garbage to. You can certainly have fun with this game, everyone ticks a different way. I just don't get off to the equivalent of being stoned to death, but all the power to you.This game is ? The same way that Metal Gear Solid V was complete too? Sorry, I shouldn't be comparing that to this game, it's just not fair. Loading screens stick around even after the game has started, textures sometimes don't load even when very close, and the bugs are everywhere. This game doesn't need more pretty textures for my characters, but vermin exterminators.As an achievement hunter, it pains me to see that practically all of these are unobtainable, given the conditions you have to work with. You either have to be lucky, or be a hacker to win at the achievements, and even the game itself.Unless you're trying to make a buck from the lootbox contents from this game, or you're a hacker, don't bother. It won't be very fun to you either ways. I eagerly await for this trend to die, otherwise we're all screwed.Edit: The game should just be called No Balls: The Game."
1,358.4,Not Recommended," July 28, 2017",16,"The game works quite well and it seems that the developers are working on fixes that the game needs. Slowly, but it is happening.However, this game deserves no positive reviews until the following issues are resolved:Do not try to ban people for stream sniping (remove that rule) and apologise to the person caught up in this mess. It is very much impossible to actually prove stream sniping and besides: there are multiple solutions (streamers enabling 2 min delay on stream, the servers not matching the same players with one another several times in a row, etc.). If you don't want to be stream sniped, find your own solution (delay, hide match ID, do not show when you queue for a game) or don't stream.While I'm okay with purely cosmetic microtransactions, please make it abundantly clear that there will still be content of this kind that can be accessed for free post-launch.They violated a promise that can be found here[archive.is] (ctrl + f, monetization) and introduced microtransactions before the game was out of EA. It does not matter if the money goes to charity or tournaments - they should've just paid out of pocket with the millions of dollars they aleady have.What this game needs is decent competition that'll scare the developers into behaving properly.Edit #1: FPP fixes the major gameplay-related issues with the game.

86,503.3,Not Recommended," October 8, 2017",14,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWGame has a start , but it is not worth the money at the moment. I would personally request a refund if I could.1. This game just has way too many hackers. Allow me to go into detail....There are times where 10+ players die before even getting out of the plane by headshots. There are times you die in one shot with level 3 armour. There are times you get shot through walls becuase they modified their textures to be invisible. There are times 20+ people die in a row by same person with all headshots. There are times you get one shot by a punch when they are 50m + away. Other players can deny the fact they have not run into hackers , but this is what i have run into constantly.2. This game is poorly optimized, I have a great PC and headset. The sound is terrible, sometimes you look in wrong direction and get shot up in back. Gameplay is never smooth as it should be, sometimes when looking out of cars my body disappears.3. Items are lacking, there really is not much item wise. Always comes down to kark98, you either have one or you don't. If you don't have one at end chances are you will lose. You will be one shot by kark98 in end every time even though you got several shots off on other weapons. The SKS is buggy as hell, it is suppose to be sniper type weapon, but accuracy on it is just god awful compared to any other gun in the game.4. Hitboxes can be off at times, maybe due to the poor server status.For me to recommend this game they really need to fix the amount of hackers and the people who get banned just because someone says they are cheating, but they are not. They need to game lot ID numbers on top right of the screen and Logs that will record players movements , weapons , accuracy, health, equipment. So that if someone claims they ran into a hacker they can post screenshot or perhaps have a report button on your killer. This game has made a lot of money, having people review logs should be within their budget."

First and foremost, Player Unknown is a liar. He made several claims that there will not be PAID FOR MICRO-TRANSACTIONS UNTIL THE GAME IS RELEASED AND IN A FINISHED STATE. Yet here we are months away from a DELAYED release and are getting micro-transactions.Secodly, all our skins and outfits we earn during the EA period will be taken away from us. In favor of a CS and DOTA skins crate system. No we will not be able to earn these crates within the game like Overwatch or Siege.THE COSMETICS ARE NOT THE ISSUE.

139,415.2,Not Recommended, April 7,12,"I've played the game from Early Access to Release and even past that.I've come to dislike the game, and I would not recommend it in it's current state.I'm going to explain my dislikes about the game in a couple different subjects.Bugs: I really enjoyed PUBG in Early Access and didn't mind the bugs and bad performance that came with it because it was in Early Access. I could accept it and enjoy the game for what it is. But as it's come to about four months after it's 1.0 Release, and the game still freezes occasionally near the start of the game and lags even with most all of the settings on low. This can kill you and it has killed me numerous times trying to get a gun and fight in hot-drop locations. This is not the only bug that I've encountered, as there are a couple more I can name, with more that I couldn't possibly name in this review otherwise the entire thing would be in this bugs section. There was a bug on the stairs in the Miramar map where you could vault through the wall and kill players from said wall. This wasn't patched for at least a week or two, and was abused like hell. I and many other players also get frequent game crashes from ""bad_module_info"", and while I've heard this is an issue with a Windows 10 update, this is the only game I experience it on, and Bluehole never decided to care or even try to fix this bug. TL;DR The game is still buggy even after 1.0 release, and the Devs would rather rake in that sweet, sweet dough with Weapon Skins than fix these bugs, and improve the performance of the game. It still runs awful even after everything. (If you want an idea of my computer specs: I run R6: Siege on Ultra settings at 60 FPS.)Guns and Gunfights: I'm honestly not even sure where to begin with this. The gunplay is nice, the recoil on the guns feels good, and the designs and which weapons they decide to implement. They used to add guns pretty frequently and did so around the time they were in early access, but that has slowed down and they rarely add guns to the game anymore. I believe it's been around 3 months (when this review is posted) that they still have not added a new gun, which leads to a bit of a bore when it comes to weapon choices. This game has it's fair share of hit registration issues and it's a bit difficult to learn how bullet drop works on some of the 4x scopes since they've changed them in recent updates. It takes practice, I understand, but I've been at the game for 100+ hours since they've changed them and I still can't figure them out.Now, for this next subject, I wasn't really sure where to place this but I suppose it'll do well in the guns and gunfights section. It's completely random, which I hate. It's a very strong word, but it repels me from dropping to hot-drop locations like; School, Prison, etc. I cannot explain to you how many times I've gone through whole buildings and never found a single weapon, while the guy in the house next to me finds an assault rifle and kills me right out the gate. Or if we're in the same building and it's a large building with a lot of rooms. I will go through 2-4 rooms and either find nothing, or a pistol in which my opponent finds a shotgun, or a rifle and proceeds to kill me because he either has the full advantage since I have no weapon, or has a very high advantage because he has a much more high powered weapon. Now I understand fully that this is a battle royale game, but that title doesn't give it the right to straight up It's unappealing, and generally makes you frustrated and angry when you get screwed by RNG multiple times over. I will also say that you could drop in the middle of nowhere since you have bad RNG, but this gets extremely boring and is also not a good way to learn the game in the first place.Now that I've finished talkings about the guns and loot distribution, I want to go into the maps:I want to start with Erangel, since this is the original map on PUBG. Now, I will say this. The map is far from perfect. But it's well designed enough that everyone is content with the map and the way it works. Cities and forests which allow you to traverse from and to each other pretty well, even with some mountains and hills in the mix. It's all around a very well designed map, though it has it's flaws. It's very well loved and it deserves the love it gets, because no matter how many times you play it, it's always fresh with the scenery and the enviroments you fight in. The buildings in the map are simple and well laid out, like I said the loot distribution is a bit wonky but they're still nice to fight in and are pretty easy to learn where the loot usually spawns.Now, I will move on to the sandy deserts of Miramar. I absolutely, with all my heart, hate this map. I do not like how much a height advantage can screw you over on this map. It's hard to traverse, and the circle closing in with hills all around you usually makes you a perfect target ripe for the picking. The terrain is hot buns, while most vehicles cannot go too fast on it without flipping, and while trying to find cover in defilades could be a nice change of pace, there are too many hills and the gunfights in these hills are just not pleasureable in the least. The buildings are too big and have too much going on in them. They feel sloppy and the loot is too spread out in this buildings, and will make you spend a lot of your time just trying to find a decent helmet, or attatchments. Erangel does better with more simple buildings that are not dull, and are fun to fight in. Games also last a lot longer on Miramar, simply because of how big the landmass is. This can lead to frustration if you lose in the top 10~ because it takes you so goddamn long just to get there in the first place. One thing that lead me down the path to hating Miramar is.. it seems that you find yourself on the map more than you find yourself on the original, Erangel. I consistently find 3-4 games in a row on Miramar, and have even found around games in a row on Miramar. I am not exaggerating when I say 7, that is a real number and it is part of why I deeply hate this map. Movement is clunky, gunfights are not fun, buildings are too complex and take too long to loot, and the sun glaring in your eyes always makes targets hard to see. It's a huge mess of a map, and I hope they remake it one day.Now, I cannot say much about the new map 'Savage' coming out soon, however it looks very well laid out with the buildings having a simple design on Erangel. Even though I have lost much interest in this game, I will definitely come back to try out the new map, as it's small scale brings more action and might just breathe new life into the game.Events: Bluehole have decided to implement events around a month~ ago (when this review is posted), and all around I think it's a good idea. However, their ideas for event gamemodes have been lack-luster, and they don't stick around too long, which is also another let down in of itself. They could really make the game more interesting with these events, but they need to be longer and they need to come up with more fresh, interesting ideas.All in all, the idea is good, the execution is lacking.I would wait to see if Bluehole decides they care about the game enough to see more bug fixes and performance issues lifted.I loved the game when I bought it in early access, and I loved it up to the release, and about two months after that release. Then the game became tedious and boring for multiple reasons, one of which being the new map. I would be willing to play the game more if they breathed new life into the game with some new content, but for right now I can't bring myself to play it because of the preformance issues I suffer, to pair with the gameplay that is slowly becoming boring and stale."

That would be alright if we weren't talking about this particular game in this particular situation. So here are the reasonable problems people have with it.-It was promised that there will be NO monetization at all during Early Access period-Game sold 5 million copies and just exploded in popularity WITH ZERO PR, a console port is being worked on. So much revenue made and they require additional funds to have a mediocre tourney at a gaming event? (such tourneys are most often low quality and small in scale)-Game has a price. It's a POPULAR pay2play game, and the price will amost certainly increase after EA.-Game has a working Steam Market. This means that they get a cut of every item bought and sold there, meaning even more revenue.-Early Access game in a wonky state being pushed into competitive scene. Any kind of Early Access game being pushed into competitive scene really.-Game, while being somewhat playable, has still piles of problems, from servers and optimization to bugs, to updates breaking♥♥♥♥♥♥every week. And instead of major improvements that would make me feel like it was worth to support an unfinished product, you give me this.-The paid crates will require current BP currency to buy and then purchase a key with $ to open them. They contain multiple sets of themed clothes, but you only get a single piece per box (only jacket, only shoes etc.) You can get duplicates on top of that.-Yet another game, where instead of a simple store where you could buy an item or bundle of items YOU WANT directly, even for real money, we get gambling, which milks all types of customers because you only have a CHANCE of getting what you want.-Team stated that all the crates after EA will be paid. Meaning that you will likely have zero ways to earn yourself even some basic different colour shirts with in-game currency, like you can right now.I enjoyed the game before this, and I was really happy to have a decent multiplayer experience of arena type last-man-standing despite constant performance problems, and it having to extra microtransactions and cosmetics being earned at decent rate was a huge upside. As it is right now I feel major regret, as it's going the standart overhyped EA money milking route.If you planned to buy this game, you can try but be ready to refund as you will need to spend some time to make it run at 60 fps before you can even have a full match. Preferably check back in ~3 months and see if microtransactons were worth it."

There is a significant chance that this game will turn into another poorly managed EA cash-grab. Until PUBG gets its promised content updates and performance improvements (instead of just milking the existing playerbase dry), I advise potential buyers to wait and see. Check back in another three to six months.Details:1. They have confirmed that there will be NO MORE free cosmetic items, and that micro transactions will be added despite the game still being in Early Access (despite promising otherwise).2. They will be adopting the CS:GO crate system, which is notoriously anti-consumer. You will be forced to buy keys to open any crates you get in-game, then get ONLY A SINGLE random item with no safeguards to prevent duplicates. This will be the case for ALL crates (confirmed by community manager). Please remember that this is a full-priced game.3. Bluehole wants the community to fund a tournament despite earning well over a hundred million dollars in sales to date.4. Players are being banned for defending themselves from Team Killers, and are simply advised to ""not play with randoms"" if they don't like it. A more insane zero tolerance policy than american public schools.A good game, but again, I cannot recommend buying it right now with these concerning points in mind.

277,313.8,Not Recommended," December 21, 2017",8,"PUBG literally was more stable in early access than it is now. At the start of every single game since release, people will not just experience the usual short delays, that we got to know during the early access phase. No. It is much worse. The game will teleport you around, until there are merely ~70 people left. Until then, enjoy teleporting all over the place.In addition, there is a huge delay during the entire game, approximately ~0.5 seconds. This will lead to you getting shot around corners repeatedly, for as long as the player count is between 30 to 70. It seems like former blu hole inc, which now likes to call itself the ""PUBG Corporation"" recently started saving lots of money by reducing server capacity. Instead of adding some sort of queue to let at least some people enjoy the game, they seem to just flood the servers with people thinking ""it's gonna work just fine after 70% of people died!""I really enjoyed the game since it was first released to early access phase. Until its release. As it is today, I can not recommend picking it up. There are desastrous server issues, that need to be fixed first. I play with dsl 100k and at its current state it is more some sort of lag-roulette than an actual first person shooter. If you still decide to give it a go I dare you not to take any staircases until at least 30 of 100 people in your game died!But not everything about PUBG is bad. Actually, it used to be a pretty good game with lots of fun, especially when you play with friends. I am convinced that the current server state is going to be improved, and when that happens I will update my review if the server quality is at least back at its early access levelHave to say that 1.0 brought some nice optimizations though, especially in terms of graphics and system resource usage. Also, the new map is amazing, and vaulting feels perfect. The game is a lot less buggy than some months ago, but still faces its issues. Cars will occasionally get stuck and explode without warning for example. The only real issue this game has at the moment is the quality of the provided servers though, which impacts gameplay a lot and makes it just not playable.tl;dr: Good game with huge server issues at the moment; has been more stable in early access; pick it up if you enjoy games based around teleportation"

324,138.5,Not Recommended," August 10, 2017",8,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWAfter 115 hours of playing PUBG, I feel like it's time to give an honest review. I'm going to break down each part of the game and if you don't feel like reading the whole thing, I'll give a TL;DR at the end.First question: Do I recommend this game to be purchased by others?Honestly, I think PUBG is an extremely fun, fast paced (when you aren't looting for 20+ minutes) game that delivers a thrill and feeling that no other game provokes. Now in saying that, it does have its flaws. Serious flaws that need to be worked out before this game will be even close to a full release. However, if you have a friend that keeps telling you ""Dude, just buy this game. It's tons of fun and I want to play it with you."" then buy it. It's an amazing game to play with friends but only with friends. (opinions are subjective) After a while of doing solo, you sort of feel like doing something else; But when I'm playing it with friends, I could play for hours and hours at a time.The pros to playing PUBG are as follows -- You never know what you're going to get, unless you land at high risk areas such as the prison or military base (there are others but I don't feel like listing all of them).- You actually feel like you're in the shoes of your character. The movement doesn't seem quick, jerky, and responsive. It feels more of what it would actually be in real life, it takes time to get up to full running speed, your character doesn't snap to where you aim but instead moves like you would yourself, and all of the motions feel very smooth overall giving a unique playstyle to the game. - I'm putting this in the same category as movement because vehicles obviously move. The vehicles you have available come in 3 varieties. Jeeps, cars, and motorcycles. Jeeps come with hard top, soft top, or no top configs. Cars come in a few different colors and are faster than jeeps. Motorcycles come with either no side car or a side car which can hold a max of 3 people. The responsiveness of the vehicles is spectacular. If you swing too wide too fast they spin out just like a real car would.- When you first spawn into the plane, that's your ride or die. You need to make sure you calculate where you land to ensure you don't get killed within the first few minutes of the game. Once you find a suitable place and start looting, sometimes you don't know if someone could be right around the corner waiting to shoot you. It gives you a sense of urgency wherever you loot and you can never be too careful. Even the downtime of the match can make your hair stand on edge. Was that bush you just saw actually a bush, or a person waiting to jump out and put a bullet into your head? The firefights are responsive and fast-paced as well. They could last minutes or seconds depending on the circumstances. They definitely got this portion of the game right.The cons to playing PUBG are as follows -- It seems like the developers are more concerned with pushing things like new guns (only ones found in drop crates and not around the world), microtransactions (only recently), and overall useless updates which they could focus more time on better ones. Now don't get me wrong, they do bugfixing often and with almost every update, but with the amount of money people have invested in this, it seems like we could get more for our money that we basically donated for an unfinished game.- The lead behind the idea of PUBG stated that we would not see microtransactions in the game until it was finished. He recently came out with a statement saying ""We needed to test them before we implimented them into the finished product"" which personally is complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. It's starting to turn from a game strictly about earning drops into something you can just pay to get which completely defeats the ones who actually give it their all to get them. I think we're all very used to the way CS:GO and like games present the ""skin"" system and I don't think we should allow them to do the same to this game. It ruins everyones fun and isn't what true gaming was meant to be about.- You're at those critical seconds between life and death, wondering, ""Will I win this game?"". Suddenly you hear an enemy to the left, your heart starts racing, the clock is counting down, and you sprint out of cover only to be confronted with the menace at your doorstep and BAM you shoot him with your AKM straight in the face AND YOU DID IT! YOU WON! WINNER WINNER CHicken din-ner? What? That's it. Woo. You won. Congrats. Here's some in-game currency for your troubles. You don't get an extra pat on the back because you win. You're basically told you're better than the people who died and move on to the next match. There seriously needs to be a loot system implemented where you get something because of winning. Not just some catch phrase at the end.If you want a really fun game that will give you hours of entertainment with friends then this is the game for you. I wouldn't recommend buying it right now in the state that it's in, though. If you can wait, I would.Great loot distribution systemClean movement systemGreat balance between fast-paced and slow-paced gameplayNo real concern for relevant updatesNewly added microtransactionsThere's no real end-game loot dropsKeep in mind there are a lot more issues with it, like players getting banned because the devs ""had a suspicion"" they were stream-sniping, there are game breaking glitches where entire cities disappear and then because someone tests the bug further the devs banned him for it (seriously look it up, that actually happened), constant lag issues, horrible game-breaking bugs where the UI won't even show up, the game crashes constantly (even if you have a good computer, though they've mostly fixed this issue) and tons of others that aren't really worth going into detail about.Until they fix the game more and actually work on better updates, I would wait until the game releases fully to purchase."
36,156.7,Not Recommended," December 26, 2017",8,"PUBG does not reinvent anything, but the developers manage to develop a basically fun game. But then it ends. The concept is good, the technical implementation is an absolute disaster. It starts with the embarrassingly low server tick rate of ~ 17 Hz and ends with the frustration which inevitably results. You could excuse it if you say it's still an early access game. Unfortunately, this is no longer the case. Version 1.0 has been released, and I can't figure out how to screw up a release like that. Extreme rubber banding in the first few minutes of play is normal, gunfire disappears into nothingness, and the general recognition of shots does not work properly. In short: In the current status, the game is an absolute joke and definitely not playable properly. I wonder how the developer comes up with the ridiculous idea of calling the game ""E-Sport ready"". Anyone who believes that is an idiot.Result: Could be a good game, but it's not at the moment. The developer just ♥♥♥♥ed up everything and threw the game onto the market unfinished."

142,64.9,Not Recommended, April 16,8,"I had hopes for this game but after seeing updates passed I realised how the devs don’t want to fix their game and instead release more useless skins and micro transactions just to make more money. Full of hackers and terrible optimización (i get like 59 fps with an i7 4790k and gtx 1060 and yes my fps are unlocked).This is why I moved to fortnite where the game its optimised, better gameplay and more people play it and the devs there actually update the game with really good content. In fortnite at least the updates are not 9gigs big with nothing new in it and make the game worse every update.Also I noticed how the devs have raised the minimum specs recently so they don’t have to optimise their game as much (it used to be a gtx 660 before now its a gtx 980 minimum). Unless the devs fox their game i highly recommend to dont buy it yet as you will just be supporting developers who dont listen to the community as they are bathing themselves in money."
132,317.7,Not Recommended," August 14, 2017",8,"AFTER RELEASE REVIEWAfter the release the game didn't get much better on the cheater side. There is still loads of cheaters.There are some frustrating things in the game- The blue zone which hunts you constantly. If you decide to move towards the middle of the circle and get attacked on the way there is no idea to stand and fight instead just get as fast as possible to the center of the circle find a good camping spot and hope people will kill each other.- The controls are somewhat clunky and the movment feeling isn't there.- The scavaging for 30mins to die once you see someone isn't fun- The scavaging for 1min and 20% of the time not getting that shotgun in the first room isn't much fun either- There should be a knock-out limit, getting tired of knocking people out from a distance only to let his friend bring him back up- The reward point system is forcing the players into playing solo if wanting to get some points. Sharing the points would make it alot more balanced and rewardingThe game is fun when it comes to tactics and strategy with team mates but else from that I wouldn't recommend the game.EARLY ACCESS REVIEWI like the game and the idea but there are so much problems with cheats, lagg, desync, hitbox mess and other stuff which makes me not recommend this game. Wait for it to be released and try it then is my recommmendations."

66,267.7,Not Recommended," November 1, 2017",6,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWThe hacking makes the game pointless. More often than not, games end in some guy making multiple headshots against your team in half a second at long distance. Vaulting, new maps, etc are pointless until people who actually play the game fairly have a chance of winning again, and not merely by the luck of joining an honest server."
207,545.7,Not Recommended, January 18,6,"PlayerUnknown's Battleground is a game that use to be wonderful until the devs wasted tons of time on unfinished additions, ignored the community and the problems it has with the game, and allowed better companies take advantage of the things they are unwilling to fix by makes superior games with better dev teams and optimzations.I put 450 hours before patch 1.0 and i loved this game, i mean ten hours of playtime a day i loved it but since 1.0 the game is ruined, i dont even do ten hours a week anymore.-Vaulting is terrible, i mean terrible. You can't even stand on rocks because of how bad it is in some places, infact that the biggest reason i die is to the enviroment because of bugs with vaulting goes to show how rushed and unfinished the game is. They should of kept the setting keybind for crouch jump, it was better than this trash vaulting and it made for much more diverse and fun gameplay.-Hackers are another huge problem in this game, but honestly the hacker epidemic exposes Bluehole for what they are, greedy devs who care nothing about the community or the game. Allowing this epidemic to continue and for so long will be the reason this game is going to die. If Bluehole were solve the problem even in 1 months time the damage is already done, everytime some dies in game they will blame hackers because the negelgence of bluehole on this subject and the game itself isnt good enough anymore to keep people around.-The one thing you hope to expect in a games development is that once you get something right, keep it that way. Unfortunatly for Bluehole the basics of game development seem to have escaped them since the weapons feel much more clunky unusable as opposed to many wonderful weapon optimization before patch 1.0. one change that comes to mind is sniper rifles, the changes to sniper rifles is very annoying and unrewarding inaddition to being unnessisary. The backsliding on weapon optimizations also extends to attachments, the ranged scope changes are irritating and once again unnessisary, if you wanted to make crossheir changes then there are 2 options that would had been better for the ranged optics, 1.Allow the player, in the settings, to choose they're optics crossheirs for what they prefer. or 2.Add multiple version of the scope types in the world so you can find what you prefer, either of these options would be better than what Bluehole did.-The new desert map it terrible in my opinion, its so bad. its so different from the first map that its unappealing to experience players, but thats not were the problem is. the problem is being forced into lobbies for the map you dont want to play, if Bluehole wanted a new map they should've made it similar to the first one so that all player would appeal to it and the need for individual map queue wouldn't seem so nessisary. To release patch 1.0 without a map selector or at the least a queue preference once again exposes the greed and carelessness of Bluehole to put an unfinished game to a completed market.-Although i do not enjoy the game, Fortnite is a much better option for someone wanting to get into the Battle royal catagory. Fortnite has a wonderful and active dev community that is excited to bring everyone the best experience possible. Fortnite is more original, much better developed, more complete, strict and swift with hackers(the few there are), weapon optimizations are good, They do only have one map but you can trust Epic Games to do right by their community and bring what you ask for to the table. Oh Yeah and Fortnite is free to play. The hard work of epic games with fortnite to bring and enjoyable and affordable experience to the Battle Royal community has paid off. its a shame that i personally cant get into it, i guess i just miss the old PUBG.In conclusion, The only way i would recommend PUBG to anyone is if they rollback to before patch 1.0 and start over from there. Im very very disappointed to have given money Bluehole. they are a wonderful example of how not to develope your game or treat the community that has been there from the start. they took our money and refused to listen or solve problems . just to ruin a game that was so good 6 months ago."

Also there are already microtransactions. I don't mind microtransactions but that's in retail titles.

207,545.7,Not Recommended, January 18,6,"PlayerUnknown's Battleground is a game that use to be wonderful until the devs wasted tons of time on unfinished additions, ignored the community and the problems it has with the game, and allowed better companies take advantage of the things they are unwilling to fix by makes superior games with better dev teams and optimzations.I put 450 hours before patch 1.0 and i loved this game, i mean ten hours of playtime a day i loved it but since 1.0 the game is ruined, i dont even do ten hours a week anymore.-Vaulting is terrible, i mean terrible. You can't even stand on rocks because of how bad it is in some places, infact that the biggest reason i die is to the enviroment because of bugs with vaulting goes to show how rushed and unfinished the game is. They should of kept the setting keybind for crouch jump, it was better than this trash vaulting and it made for much more diverse and fun gameplay.-Hackers are another huge problem in this game, but honestly the hacker epidemic exposes Bluehole for what they are, greedy devs who care nothing about the community or the game. Allowing this epidemic to continue and for so long will be the reason this game is going to die. If Bluehole were solve the problem even in 1 months time the damage is already done, everytime some dies in game they will blame hackers because the negelgence of bluehole on this subject and the game itself isnt good enough anymore to keep people around.-The one thing you hope to expect in a games development is that once you get something right, keep it that way. Unfortunatly for Bluehole the basics of game development seem to have escaped them since the weapons feel much more clunky unusable as opposed to many wonderful weapon optimization before patch 1.0. one change that comes to mind is sniper rifles, the changes to sniper rifles is very annoying and unrewarding inaddition to being unnessisary. The backsliding on weapon optimizations also extends to attachments, the ranged scope changes are irritating and once again unnessisary, if you wanted to make crossheir changes then there are 2 options that would had been better for the ranged optics, 1.Allow the player, in the settings, to choose they're optics crossheirs for what they prefer. or 2.Add multiple version of the scope types in the world so you can find what you prefer, either of these options would be better than what Bluehole did.-The new desert map it terrible in my opinion, its so bad. its so different from the first map that its unappealing to experience players, but thats not were the problem is. the problem is being forced into lobbies for the map you dont want to play, if Bluehole wanted a new map they should've made it similar to the first one so that all player would appeal to it and the need for individual map queue wouldn't seem so nessisary. To release patch 1.0 without a map selector or at the least a queue preference once again exposes the greed and carelessness of Bluehole to put an unfinished game to a completed market.-Although i do not enjoy the game, Fortnite is a much better option for someone wanting to get into the Battle royal catagory. Fortnite has a wonderful and active dev community that is excited to bring everyone the best experience possible. Fortnite is more original, much better developed, more complete, strict and swift with hackers(the few there are), weapon optimizations are good, They do only have one map but you can trust Epic Games to do right by their community and bring what you ask for to the table. Oh Yeah and Fortnite is free to play. The hard work of epic games with fortnite to bring and enjoyable and affordable experience to the Battle Royal community has paid off. its a shame that i personally cant get into it, i guess i just miss the old PUBG.In conclusion, The only way i would recommend PUBG to anyone is if they rollback to before patch 1.0 and start over from there. Im very very disappointed to have given money Bluehole. they are a wonderful example of how not to develope your game or treat the community that has been there from the start. they took our money and refused to listen or solve problems . just to ruin a game that was so good 6 months ago."

I do really like it.----------------------------**TL;DR version:**1. Unoptimized, the only game that features an open-world map that I couldn't play on top performance.I tried this game with VERY LOW graph setting on both my PC that has GTX950 and my laptop that has GTX1050.2. Dev team is potentially greedy. (More details below)3. Bluehole already announced another new game.----------------------------However, I can't really recommend this game for anyone who has not bought it yet.The progress of the development is so slow and they are focussing on other things instead of optimizing the main game itself.You can actually read many other negative reviews to get the general idea.If they've given us many updates, most of them were updates on unnecessary things such as in-game advertising (this game is free to play btw just in case we forgot), and more new cosmetic items to increase the value of their loot crates obviously, the so called ""loot"" crates are priced at 700 BP for the first one, 1400 the second one, 2800, 4200, 5600, and 7000 BP at max - they will reset the price every monday if I'm not mistaken.If you're super good at a round and killed so many people by whatever means necessary - you might get around more than 500 BP, maybe? << this is rare for me that's why I'm not sure - I did once gained more than 1000 BP if my memory is not messed up.But my average on every game would be like 100-150 BP.One game could take as long as 30 minutes when you are doing pretty good and maybe it will get you 300 BP if you dont kill that many people while still winning the game.Knowing all that info above, do we still remember that this game is not a free-to-play game? Not to mention that this is an early-access game?Man, I know gamedevs needs to eat, but how much money have they gained already from all those sales? They are not as greedy as the notorious Ubisoft yet, but I am getting the same vibe from them.They once tested the microtransaction system with the gamescom tournament where we need to buy keys to open the gamescom crate. They are greedy, and a greedy gamedev team does not make me feel comfortable in recommending their games."

In the last 7 months, this developer has prioritized:-Suing another company for using their idea (not copyright or anything, just for having a similar mode in their game) (UPDATE: While a lawsuit was not made, they are ""looking into"" any action against Epic games since they are the ones they license their engine from.)-Cosmetic crates (some are pay to unlock, others are free. Normally not an issue, but they said they wouldn't until the full release.)-Stream sniping issues/bans-Ads in the Chinese version (probably only a matter of time before other countries get this)-Trying a push to be the next big esport.-Porting this game to Xbox One, despite being unfinished on PC.And in the meantime, these issues continue to go unfixed or unaddressed:-Hacking and cheating becoming more common.-The dreadful performance, even on great PCs-Huge server spikes, sometimes disconnecting you, or at least leaving you stuck in the open for a bit.-Interface issues since release (button presses not registering, clipping issues etc.)-Game is still considered early access, naturally.This game is really fun. I know this is counter to what I was saying before, but it's true. It's a wonder to be successful in this industry with a fresh idea, especially when it has such a high replayability. This game is something special, but some companies can't handle a huge surge of fame and money, and BluePoint is starting to prove that. I have no problem with them wanting to make money, but I do have a problem with people not being aware of these issues before they fork over their cash. Chances are due to it's current success none of this will matter, but I feel a warning of this behavior is necessary for what to expect in the future. This is the top game on Steam right now and it looks like there is nothing to show for it."

196,132.3,Recommended," May 6, 2017",6,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWSo I've played the game for little over 24 hours which I feel is enough playtime to base this review off of.The game is very enjoyable and quite addictive. Everytime I die I jump right back into a new game without even realising to try and get higher than the previous game. The map, weapons, and vehicles are ok, but I can't help but feel like there should be more vehicles in certain parts of the map, and also a larger variety of weapons. Most of the time the kill feed consists of people getting kills with nothing but 3 or 4 different guns.There are some technical issues with the game and older computers may struggle to keep stable fps or hit 60 fps at least. I'm running a GTX 1060 with an i5 6600k and still getting < 60fps sometimes with medium settings, especially when there are explosions nearby. I definitely think the minimum requiremements need to be adjusted.As for hackers and cheaters, I am unable to say for a fact that I've come across a hacker or cheater. Although some of my deaths raised some suspicion, I can't say for sure if they were hacking or just got some lucky shots until we see some sort of replay system (which the devs are working on).Overall the game is very fun at the current stage, and it will only get better in the future with the release of updates and patches. This is my first battle royals game and I would be lying if I said I haven't enjoyed every minute of it so far. If you have a decent computer and a fan of the battle royals genre, this is a must buy. For those with older computers, I would recommend you wait a few weeks/months until some performance issues are fixed.Thanks for reading,.exe"

Daha fazla uzatmadan hemen incelemeyece başlayalım.''H1Z1 Mİ PUBG Mİ ABİY'' Tartışmasına hiç girmeyeceğim. Anlamadığım şey neden böyle bir karşılaştırma var. İkiside gayet iyi oyunlar neden ikisi arasında bir seçim yapalım ki? varsa ikisini de oynayın. Marvel VS Dc gibi bir şey oldu bu ama gerek yok. Siz Marvel veya DC ayırt ediyor musunuz gerçekten? ben etmiyorum şahsen. Filmler güzel ise izlenir bunu fanboylukla karıştırmayalım. Bu da böyle bir şey işte. Neden seçim yapıyorsunuz ki? ikisini de oynayın açıkçası iki oyun birbiriyle pek karşılaştırılacak türden değil tamamen aynı oyunlar değiller çünkü. Ama sizde ikiside yoksa sonda kendi fikrimi açıklayacağım.EDİT: Evet konuya girmemiş halim bu.Klasik Lootla ve devam et modunda oyun. Oyun bu konuda gayet iyi bana göre. Silahlar çeşitli, Oyun alanı bayağı bir geniş ve buda oynayış stilinizi nasıl yapacağınız konusunda fikir veriyor. İster araba bulup ortalığı savaş alanına katın, isterseniz daha pasif oynayarak loot olayına ''DAHA ÇOK'' yönelin. Bu konuda oyun özgür bırakıyor. Araba mekanikleri ise yeterli düzeyde. Malum bu oyundaki silahlardan sonra en önemli şey bir ''binek''. Araba kontrolleri tabii ki bir GTA V düzeinde değil ama MAFIA II kadar da kötü değil. Orta şeker. Oyunda tabii ki doğal olarak CREW mantığı da mevcut ve bence gerçekten birinci olacağım diye oynayacaksanız kesinlikle bir takımla girmenizi öneririm.Grafikler ultrada çok iyi görünüyor. Ama oyunda genel bir kahverengi tonu var ve bazıları için kötü gelebilir bu durum. Açıkçası ben H1Z1'in grafiklerini daha çok beğenmiştim ama bu da gayet güzel.PUBG gayet güzel bir deneyim sunuyor. Oynanış gayet iyi. Eğer H1Z1'iniz varsa ve oynuyorsanız şu an almayabilirsiz. Ama değişik şeyler arıyorsanız tavsiye ediyorum-Silah çeşitliliği (yeni updatelerle daha çok silah geliyor)-Loot olayı-Haritanın genişliği-Çorba parası-Optimizasyon (Düzeltildi)-Oyunun kahverengi tonu ''sayılabilir''-Bazen adamları göremeyebiliyorsunuz.-BUGLAR (ekran görüntüme bakabilirsiniz)10*10 Kendi görüşüm.

This piece of software runs horrible, it sounds horrible, and it feels horrible. It suffers from ArmAitis, in that after you've seen three structures you've seen them all. Considering that most of the gameplay involves structures, it's going to feel like the same thing every single run. This game has two purposes. One is that it panders to streamers exclusively. Without this software, streamers wouldn't be able to eat. It's like a bitcoin mining rig but for Twitch. The other goal of the game is to take dollars and reunite your friendships. Precisely like any and every other video game, it's better with friends. You'll go on grand adventures spending 40 minutes driving around and 2 minutes shooting up the bad guys, making great journey memories like talking about how poorly the game runs or talking about other video games you should play next. After those two reasons to exist, this piece of software is pretty bad.Are there reasons people would want to buy it? Of course. Marketing. Are there reasons people would enjoy the four seconds of adrenaline you get when you hear the ear piercing THK noise of being shot from a bush? Of course. Boredom. Was the sales count justified? Hell no. This game for this price in this market with that Early Access tag should have been a quick flash burn of excitement followed by some gruelling years of the developers really putting in effort to earn their keep. Instead, that flash burn of excitement led to the most stable high volume high value digital trade marketplace this side of the NYSE. Now the developers can earn their crispy millions the easy way, and everyone who has a stake in those four seconds of adrenaline feeds that behavior into a beast.For those of you poorboys out there who can only afford something like this once a year and jumped on it: bless your heart. Weather out the storm."

203,185.2,Recommended," June 23, 2017",4,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWThis game is flawed but it's also a lot of fun. While there are plenty of bugs and some crashes, I feel as if this game has overall great and fun gameplay. It's good as a casual game, while also having a serious nature. The ability to just begin another game immediately after you die with lightning-fast matchmaking times leaves for no downtime and for the fun to just continue. I feel as if the game will most likely get much better over time, but even its current state it has great gameplay that makes me recommend the game.However, there are some bugs that need addressing, for one cheating does need to be somewhat addressed as many other reviews have pointed out, in my personal experiences I have encountered no blatant cheaters in 30 hours of gameplay however there is still clearly a problem as many hit-reg techniques are done client-side. The game is also incredibly unoptimised, so if you have a bad PC don't even bother buying the game until it's better optimised. In my case, I'm running the game with an i5-6500 and a GTX 1080 (a bit of a bottleneck I know :P) and in most areas I can just get 60fps on lowest settings (except texture quality which is at medium, setting it to low didn't seem to change anything for me), and when dropping from the plane I usually get 20-30fps. Some areas I can go as high as 100fps, however this is inconsistant and I also have experienced frame drops. The servers can sometimes have extreme rubberbanding towards the start of a game, which is definitely annoying and can impact gameplay towards the beginning of a match. There are also some vehicle physics problems, and in my 30 hours I've crashed maybe 2 or 3 times. Finally, the spectator mode when playing with friends is very bugged, and when watching someone aim down sights, their aim appears far off where they are actually shooting.However, if you can run the game, most of these problems didn't really break my experience or affect me personally to a large extent. Many are slightly annoying, but if you can get past them the experience doesn't fall short. PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds is fun, solo or with friends. The feeling of getting kills is great in this game, or getting a good placement. When you get frustrated (no-one likes an early death) it's easy to just start anew and queue again.

All my gaming time goes into this and trust me it is worth it.From the moment of forming squad and you start a game, to the moment when you are in the top 5.The thrill keeps on increasing, the nerves start getting to you, it's all about how well can you deal with it.The teamwork, gamesense, awareness, and every single thing any other game has ever taught you, you will need it here.And, don't get me started on how rewarding the game is, the feeling of surviving at the end and winning or carrying your team to victory, no other game has never given me such adrenaline.I have had so many moments laughing, having fun and a lot more with shaky hands trying to clutch at the end, and all of this has been worth it, worth more than what I paid for.Would buy again. 11/10."

I was so excited for first person servers to be introduced, but the servers ended up being a complete mess, rubberbanding, desync, you name it. They effectively destroyed drag-looting for no reason. It almost seems as if they put all of their time into a different kind of content... The microtransactions are the nail in the coffin. Not only have they broken a promise to the player; they also ripped us off with these new crates as well. I had expected a crate that would contain full outfits at least. I wouldve accepted that as a sort of compromise. Instead we got a crate that contains a bunch of $2.50 bloody shoes. I honestly had very high hopes for this game, hopefully Bluehole can turn this around and actually keep their promises in the future. If that ever happens I will change the content of this review.

178,245.5,Recommended," April 15, 2017",4,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWI wish there was an 'indifferent' button when reviewing Early Access games, almost like a recommendation to 'hold off until we see more development'. Anyway, let's begin.I will do this review, as per my other reviews on a positive / indifferent / negative basis.Postives:Balance- This game isn't P2W, and everyone is treat equally upon starting the map (From what i've seen). This is great and makes the 'advantage' based purely upon knowing the basic mechanics and how weapons/upgrades and the enviroment works. Experience is key to becoming more succesful. This is how games should always playout.Weapons- The guns are rather varied and feel useful depending on the situation. Melee is abit clunky and useless given how readily available and easier to manage ranged weapons are, but i can't complain much.Sound- The audio in the game is really great for the weapons. The bullet noises and the weather audio quality is pretty great and hearing gunshots and fire fights in the distance truly adds to the tensionWorld Map- It's nothing special but there is enough variation to keep me happy for now. I do expect to see improvements over the coming months but all in all for a recently released earlier access game i'm contentIndifference:-As it's early acces this will be left blank (Minus one point below). Instead i'll do a 'Future Desires' and checklist of what i'd like to see in future patches and updates.-MusicThis could be phenomonal if done correctly. So far (I don't imagine it's on their priority list right now) it's pretty much nonexistant. Some layered level of OST between strolling around searching in the countryside and then entering an area near a town, where enemies could be waiting with a build up in tension would be suitable, as an example.Negative:- OptimizationIt's early access iso this is no surprise and hopefully it will change. But it can be really bloody awful when loading in too a zone or moving around highly dense areas even with top tier cards.- ReplayabilityThere isn't enough incentive atm to warrant replayability. The concept is simple and effective, but requires alot of fleshing out and variation in game modes / group play / longer match types before i'll honestly consider putting too much more time into it without friends. I often found myself in the top 10 everytime by using my head, and at that point in the game it TRULY becomes amazing but unfortunetly it's over too soon. Smaller based maps (zones) that don't decrease in size so quickly would definetly add a new flavour to the game i feel.Future UpdatesIntroduce:- New Weapons- New Game Modes / Larger time limit- New Vehicles- More Customization- Music / OST- 'Bleed out effects'- Wildlife- More variation in architecture, buildings and the enviromentOther than that i can safetly say it is worth investing and keeping an eye on but at a LATER time (not now), once we see what the developers plan to do.They have made ALOT of money from the game so far, so don't purchase the game until we see some content from the developers themselves. As always with Early Access you run the risk of buying a game and seeing the Developers running away. I'm not saying they will, but as always BE CAUTIOUS and know what you're getting yourself into. Give it a couple of months and see how the game has changed. If its looking good with weekly/monthly updates then buy it, if not then be glad you read this review.Thanks for reading!"

The developers have worked hard in collecting feedback and fixing, optimizing etc.The problem I have is this game is now flooded with cheat users and all BlueHole cares about is the amount of sales they've accomplished. #1 sales in China, most cheat users are from china, but they wont region lock China claiming it's ""racist"". The majority of the NA is filled with AS, and they all cheat.Am I being a big baby about it? Yeah, I dont like cheat users. I don't call them hackers because they arent. The coders who develop the cheat are the hackers who reverse engineered the game. All these people only buy and 'use' said cheat, they are far from hackers, they are just griefers.I lost all enjoyment in this game when I play now, because 9/10 times I'm killed by cheats and Deathcam only shows that the person doesn't care about hiding anything.Get your♥♥♥♥♥♥together, get it all together and put it in a back pack, all your♥♥♥♥♥♥ so it's together.

472,309.9,Not Recommended, January 31,4,"Is there only 1 ""down"" thumb?Absolute garbage. There are hackers everywhere. This company became successful by accident, they have terrible customer service, they shut it down during peak hours (for 2+ hours) with no warning, they change features and screw over players in the process.It's not too common I leave such a one-sided review, but this one has been earned. The discussion boards are filled with angry users before the moderators can delete them and they attempt to use the Steam discussions page as an excuse to ban and punish players.On top of this, they have yet to do anything about the hackers blatantly shooting through walls (visible in replays), with auto-aim. There are regional servers, but the regional restrictions are not enforced, meaning exploits and lag.As a side note, this company's business model is appalling, they chose to make an MMORPG that is already receiving poor ratings by Youtube reviewers because it's so broken, instead of fixing this game."
354,270.2,Recommended," March 24, 2017",4,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWThere's a lot of different views on this game. Whilst yes, it is badly optimised and unplayable in certain large cities, it has huge potential and I've gotta say it's the best Battle Royale game out there at the moment!If you have a pretty solid PC, get it and it should be playable. If you've not, maybe hang back a few months or so until the game gets some patches.I've got a I5 6500 and GTX 1060 and I'm getting pretty good FPS, between 30 to around 90 with it dipping to around 20 fps.This game is very enjoyable and if there's anyone out there wondering what it's like compared to H1Z1, its like 100000x better, like so much better. If your still uncertain, watch some streamers playing it, but it really is a very fun game.Good luck everyone! May the odds be ever in your favour! ;)"

Then came the seemingly uncontrolled onslaught of Chinese hackers that have made the game vitually unplayable. The so called ""North American"" servers have more Chinese in them than Americans, Canadians, or Mexicans. From what I can tell Bluehole has done absolutely nothing to fix this and until they do I'd advise staying away from this game for the foreseable future until Bluehole decides to treat their players with some respect. Don't spend the $20 right now unless you're looking for hacking and anger."
1,443.9,Recommended," June 18, 2017",4,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWDo you ever sit at home, thinking, ""I'm not angry enough right now... I need some rage in my life""? If you do, then buy this game immediately. If on the other hand you're trying to keep your stress levels down, you may want to reconsider this purchase.The game is a battle royale (100 men enter, 1 man leaves) scenario with randomised weapon drops on an isolated Slavic island. You parachute in, run and superman punch your way to the best loot available in your drop zone and prey you don't get shafted in the first five minutes like the scrub you're desperately trying not to be. If by some divine gift you manage to win, you're treated to the promise of a digital chicken dinner for what it's worth. If When you die you'll probably rage for a minute or two, convince yourself that your untimely death was unavoidable, that the game was lagging/gitching or that your killer was cheating before loading the game up again in some sort of twisted rage cycle...Things will happen in this game that will drive you insane and make you hate it at times. There are still lags and glitches in this game which are unforgiveable in a competitive shooter and they will cause you to die/lose at times. It would be unfair of me to give a negative review because of this, especially considering the game's still in early access, but it's something to be aware of if you're a competitive kind of person that takes stats seriously.Apart from the whole rage/blood pressure thing though, the game is great. It looks great, it plays great, it has amazing moments in it, it's incredibly satisfying when a game goes well and it's a a great game to play either on solo or with friends. For me, the games positives definitely outweigh the negatives even in early access, and with a dev working on the game who is so involved, I'm hoping that things are only going to get better with this title."

Bluehole is incapable of actively detecting or preventing the hackers and instead just ban huge waves once a month.

193,831.2,Recommended," August 17, 2017",4,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWIt's fun, but it has some real flaws.Netcode isn't great and probably never will be.Hit reg is pretty bad.Client-authoritative, which means that if a client tells the server that it hit someone, the server agrees, no matter if there's houses, trees or ground in between.Any type of lag (my client, server or opponents' client) makes that terrible. Peaking and moving into cover in crucial moments may have dire consequences.I still have a lot of fun, and it gets my heart pounding at times. The game is a decent mix of strategy and RNG ♥♥♥♥ery. Although the RNG of the circle can be terribly frustrating at times, and it sort of gives away the win to the people who happens to be camping the right spot."
328,239.4,Not Recommended, January 8,4,"This is a great game for the price. The mechanics and graphics aren't the best but very few other games really ratchet up the tension in the way this one does. Hearing a footstep outside your building and holding your breath waiting to see if they come inside, running through woods as you realise the blue is coming to get you - fantastic.However, sad to say that since the new year every other game has ended with a death by a hacker. They don't even bother to hide it, you can see it directly via the kill cam afterwards. Aimbots, wall-hacks, ESP, recoil macros, shooting through walls, fences, mountains, headshots from a kilometre away - it has the absolute lot. Look at the leaderboards to see people who have been there for ages with insane k/d ratios.It's a massive pity as the hacking is currently ruining a great game. Don't waste your money until they have sorted this out."
113,103.0,Not Recommended, January 21,4,"Could be a fun game on the occasions where there aren't hackers in-game, but those games are about 50/50. With the growing popularity of the title right now, it is a hot-bed for hackers as of the time of this review (Jan 2018). The devs are no-doubt working on it, but I'd hold-off on purchasing this garbage fire until the hacking is gotten under control. It is particularly excruciating in a title such as this where you must spend a good portion of the session searching for gear and exploring the map. Finding you ideal set-up, simply for you and your team to be shot from outside of the effective range of a weapon, through a wall, without using their sight is particualrly rage enducing."
246,216.2,Not Recommended," September 5, 2017",4,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWI love this game to death really. I think the combat is on point, the gameplay is perfect and the community is just the perfect amount of cancer.That being said, when I'm able to go to Twitch and watch streams of relatively known streamers complaing about supposed stream sniping with no grounds or even reporting to the Dev's that they are being harassed, and there are actual bans coming out of it, I know that something is wrong. This became even more apparent when I looked at the recent reviews and 7/10 of them were talking about streamers, most commonly StoneMountain64, getting them banned for reasons of ""harassment"" or ""stream sniping."" After watching his stream for awhile, I saw just how often he would throw around these accusations and it was disapointing to me. The fact that the Dev's are actually banning players on this guys word is appalling to me.Until the Dev's take a second and realise that just because somebody streams their game to the internet and they want to stay on good terms with the majority, they can't begin banning their community without sufficient evidence of a breach of terms.I hope in the future I can change my review to the positive that this game deserves. Until that time, I'll continue avoiding every streamer I can.Also, ♥♥♥♥ this game until they region lock it. The amount of times I've died to laggy Asian players on U.S. servers is beginning to outnumber the times I've died to someone on the same continent as me."

I was playing a match with a squad and we were all inside a vehicle (UAZ) which was pretty fast and all it took for the guy to knock us all out was 1 bullet each.

So if I shoot the wrong person (as in streamer) I'll get banned without warning and without the possibility to explain myself.I haven't got banned yet and I'll enjoy the game until.Also there is the issue of the game getting more into the business of marketing customizations, ie csgo skins, instead of being idk..

Whilst yes, it is badly optimised and unplayable in certain large cities, it has huge potential and I've gotta say it's the best Battle Royale game out there at the moment!If you have a pretty solid PC, get it and it should be playable. If you've not, maybe hang back a few months or so until the game gets some patches.I've got a I5 6500 and GTX 1060 and I'm getting pretty good FPS, between 30 to around 90 with it dipping to around 20 fps.This game is very enjoyable and if there's anyone out there wondering what it's like compared to H1Z1, its like 100000x better, like so much better. If your still uncertain, watch some streamers playing it, but it really is a very fun game.Good luck everyone! May the odds be ever in your favour! ;)"
1,443.9,Recommended," June 18, 2017",4,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWDo you ever sit at home, thinking, ""I'm not angry enough right now... I need some rage in my life""? If you do, then buy this game immediately. If on the other hand you're trying to keep your stress levels down, you may want to reconsider this purchase.The game is a battle royale (100 men enter, 1 man leaves) scenario with randomised weapon drops on an isolated Slavic island. You parachute in, run and superman punch your way to the best loot available in your drop zone and prey you don't get shafted in the first five minutes like the scrub you're desperately trying not to be. If by some divine gift you manage to win, you're treated to the promise of a digital chicken dinner for what it's worth. When you die you'll probably rage for a minute or two, convince yourself that your untimely death was unavoidable, that the game was lagging/gitching or that your killer was cheating before loading the game up again in some sort of twisted rage cycle...Things will happen in this game that will drive you insane and make you hate it at times. There are still lags and glitches in this game which are unforgiveable in a competitive shooter and they will cause you to die/lose at times. It would be unfair of me to give a negative review because of this, especially considering the game's still in early access, but it's something to be aware of if you're a competitive kind of person that takes stats seriously.Apart from the whole rage/blood pressure thing though, the game is great. It looks great, it plays great, it has amazing moments in it, it's incredibly satisfying when a game goes well and it's a a great game to play either on solo or with friends. For me, the games positives definitely outweigh the negatives even in early access, and with a dev working on the game who is so involved, I'm hoping that things are only going to get better with this title."

328,239.4,Not Recommended, January 8,4,"This is a great game for the price. The mechanics and graphics aren't the best but very few other games really ratchet up the tension in the way this one does. Hearing a footstep outside your building and holding your breath waiting to see if they come inside, running through woods as you realise the blue is coming to get you - fantastic.However, sad to say that since the new year every other game has ended with a death by a hacker. They don't even bother to hide it, you can see it directly via the kill cam afterwards. Aimbots, wall-hacks, ESP, recoil macros, shooting through walls, fences, mountains, headshots from a kilometre away - it has the absolute lot. Look at the leaderboards to see people who have been there for ages with insane k/d ratios.It's a massive pity as the hacking is currently ruining a great game. Don't waste your money until they have sorted this out."
113,103.0,Not Recommended, January 21,4,"Could be a fun game on the occasions where there aren't hackers in-game, but those games are about 50/50. With the growing popularity of the title right now, it is a hot-bed for hackers as of the time of this review (Jan 2018). The devs are no-doubt working on it, but I'd hold-off on purchasing this garbage fire until the hacking is gotten under control. It is particularly excruciating in a title such as this where you must spend a good portion of the session searching for gear and exploring the map. Finding you ideal set-up, simply for you and your team to be shot from outside of the effective range of a weapon, through a wall, without using their sight is particualrly rage enducing."
193,831.2,Recommended," August 17, 2017",4,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWIt's fun, but it has some real flaws.Netcode isn't great and probably never will be.Hit reg is pretty bad.Client-authoritative, which means that if a client tells the server that it hit someone, the server agrees, no matter if there's houses, trees or ground in between.Any type of lag (my client, server or opponents' client) makes that terrible. Peaking and moving into cover in crucial moments may have dire consequences.I still have a lot of fun, and it gets my heart pounding at times. The game is a decent mix of strategy and RNG ♥♥♥♥ery. Although the RNG of the circle can be terribly frustrating at times, and it sort of gives away the win to the people who happens to be camping the right spot."
246,216.2,Not Recommended," September 5, 2017",4,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWI love this game to death really. I think the combat is on point, the gameplay is perfect and the community is just the perfect amount of cancer.That being said, when I'm able to go to Twitch and watch streams of relatively known streamers complaing about supposed stream sniping with no grounds or even reporting to the Dev's that they are being harassed, and there are actual bans coming out of it, I know that something is wrong. This became even more apparent when I looked at the recent reviews and 7/10 of them were talking about streamers, most commonly StoneMountain64, getting them banned for reasons of ""harassment"" or ""stream sniping."" After watching his stream for awhile, I saw just how often he would throw around these accusations and it was disapointing to me. The fact that the Dev's are actually banning players on this guys word is appalling to me.Until the Dev's take a second and realise that just because somebody streams their game to the internet and they want to stay on good terms with the majority, they can't begin banning their community without sufficient evidence of a breach of terms.I hope in the future I can change my review to the positive that this game deserves. Until that time, I'll continue avoiding every streamer I can.Also, ♥♥♥♥ this game until they region lock it. The amount of times I've died to laggy Asian players on U.S. servers is beginning to outnumber the times I've died to someone on the same continent as me."

An insane amouts of bugs and glitches aswell that bring the game to ""nearly unplayable"".3. Graphic optimization of this game is getting worse. The decent systems are struggling with keeping up decent frames. Lag spikes, Frame drops and overheating make this game a chore to play.4.

The amount of speed hackers and aimbotters have insanely increased in the past two weeks (very noticable). The leaderboards are dominated by hack advertisers and blatant hackers.2. Server optimization, lag and desync are still a huge problem, and is getting worse. Hits don't register due to the desync and bad netcode.

The servers are still awful, the game also still looks quite ugly in many respects, and in many ways runs just as poorly as it looks. Looking at the xbox release, the level of polish isnt just pathetic, its nonexistant.This isnt a mod anymore, it isnt some little indie game thats humble and worked on by a small team. This game has made MILLIONS AND MILLIONS. and yet the quality of the product itself is still extremely lacking. It's almost impressive... the utter avarice on display by the developer here is shocking. no more hiding behind early access anymore, your game is absolutely broken, and any other developer would have been ran out of town with a product that performs like this.I get the appeal to the game, but it's run by a man who believes he MADE, CREATED the battle royale genre, where he simply didnt. And if that fact doesnt lend more credibility to the point that this project, and team are strongly misguided, and deeply flawed, i don't know what else would. I would like to see some updates that bring this to actual 1.0 release levels of quallity, but what is on display here isnt a complete and polished game. It's still a cute little idea that got far too big for its britches. It now exists as a gray area between indie and AAA development all the while making AAA money and hiding behind terms like: ""indie"" and ""early access"" for far too long. Just wait till there's microtransactions everyone, theyre coming. Trust me. And im sure they will be implemented far before any of the glaring issues from day one, I repeat, issues from day one that still exist, have been fixed. Shameful."

29,232.6,Not Recommended," November 7, 2017",4,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWI will NOT recommend this game to ANYONE until they can fix their current hacker issue. I used to laugh at all the reviews and streamers complaining about hackers, believing that encountering hackers is extremely rare. But in the past two weeks alone I have encountered hackers in the last 7/10 games. It started out as something as simple as someone with a speedhack sprinting across the map to get into the playzone, then it became a problem with aimbot when someone would double tap me in the head with an SMG from across the town (he literally shot at the wall I was behind just before I ran out of the building then shot my teammate in the head not 1 second after shooting me, my teammate was on the other side of town). In a more recent match I shot a man in the face with a Kar98 when he wasn't looking then pulled out my assault rifle and shot him multiple times, he then turned towards me and shot a total of three shots and instant killed me.This game has so much potential but as always, the devs got their damn money and don't care about anything other than aesthetic appeal to draw in more players and more money. I would not be surprised if they abandoned PUBG after the console release.UPDATE: Ran into another hacker that got at least 10 consecutive headshot kills with a Kar98 in the final playzone then shot my teammate in the head after turning around and started to shoot the ground in front of my head but his aimbot didn't account for the ridge I was hiding behind. After he ran out of ammo with his Kar98 I popped up and began to shoot him but he pulled an assault rifle out and instantly headshotted me. I think it's safe to say I will be uninstalling this game until they fix their hacker issue."

It's rare you get into a game where there isn't at least one hacker there to ruin everything and waste your time.Hell, even the devs admitted once that the vast majority of hackers were coming from China. Banning them and bragging how you've managed to ban hundreds of thousands of people isn't going to do anything when they can easily just buy another cheap copy and go right back to cheating. You're not achieving anything by banning them unless the anti-cheat is updated in a way that actually locks them out of playing again.In short, buy at your own risk if you don't mind hackers or wait till the devs decide to listen to us and do the right thing without pulling out the ""lol don't be racist give the Chinese a chance"" card.

51,259.8,Recommended," November 22, 2017",4,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWWhen it was released a few months ago, by then it was hard to say whether it was going to be a great game with monthly upgrades or just another high-potential title which would be left to rot by the devs. Today we've got our answer about this question... But there is hope.Don't get me wrong, I don't mean to be rude as writting this, I have spent 200+ hours on this and at least half of them were worth it, but there are a few points you need to know before you decide whether you're going to purcharse it or not. First of all, this game is pretty fun if you have friends to play with, that's its main goal to make you interact with people in order to elaborate tactics which will guide your team to the victory, otherwise you may feel a little bit frustrated after dying to a squad or duo playing alone. If you choose to get into a random squad/duo, these random pals may not agree with your calls and will most likely end up playing for themselves, but you can be lucky and partner up with a friendly dude who will make the match be worth it, even if you lose.That leads me to another important point: communication. That's crucial to talk with your teammates throughout the match to provide needful information about an enemy you have spotted, items and vehicles location, where to go, etc. Microphone is an indispensable tool to raise up your experience to its finest.Now let's talk about bugs, because this game still have a lot of them nowadays. When you start playing you might not be able to figure out if you've just witnessed a bug or it was just part of the game's physics, but once you reach +50 hours you will start seeing them everywhere. Lands badly modeled, textures which will not load/render in the first minutes of the match and cars exploding after slightly touching a rock are just a few examples of them. But the most frustrating fact about this game is part of its own physics: the circle! Even the greatest of your efforts will be useless when it comes to the circle arbitrary will. Sometimes it will close far behind from you, at the exact opposite from where you are, and that is very frustrating, it may cost you the match because in many times you will find yourself crossing a open ground to get to the safe zone and getting killed during the runing. That happens a lot. The devs claim the circle is totally random, but I doubt it.It's been almost 2 months since the last big upgrade which brought up new features like Mini 14, the fog map and many new cosmetics, since then just a few updates happened without great news about performance, this game is very poorly optimized, way better than before, but still not good enough.My final advice: buy it aware of everything I said above or wait until it gets better (what may take a year or half)."

Because of this it's impossible for new players to improve and get better at the game as they can only get around 5 secs of combat every 10-15 minutes.Until there is some sort of practice mode i would not recommend this game to anyone who doesn't have alot of experience with shooters. Definitely a waste of 30 bucks for me."

This game is well worth the money and the ONLY thing you need to be aware of is the performance, you can NOT play this if you have a borderline PC, lets face it, this is an early access game, this is meant to run on a modern gaming PC, if you have a laptop or a PC that generally is behind the curb on technology you need to wait to buy this game until optimization or you upgrade.

39,224.1,Not Recommended, January 11,4,"Where to start? I enjoyed this game. A lot. The early early Access was quite fun and well, you could say bugs were inevitable and at that point quite amusing. Finding the same bugs in the ""Finished"" version, sucks. A lot. The Server are still unstable and the heavy influx of chinese players on the OC and EU server doesn't make it any better. A simple Regionlock with the option of changing servers, if you play with friends overseas. But no. Furthermore the new map, which I view as a variable mode. Fun to play from time to time, but it would be appriciated if I could choose on which I play. Last but not least, ""Lootcrates and Keys"". I could live with the fact of bugs, server lags, rubberbanding and crashes for the sake of fun. But artificially inflating the market is a no go for me to earn a positiverecommandation. There is no point in selling cosmetics unless they are brought by players, who think it is normal to spend in game currency to unlock their full game. And yes, I count cosmetics and appearance changing as part of the purchase I made. Selling a EA for full retail price is one thing, being shady another. Sadly PUBG Corp. showed, like many other devs and publisher it's about the money, not the player.Edit:Now February 12th, there is still no implementation of a Map choice, no optimisation what so ever and Battle Eye themselves proclaimes thet the Hackerproblem is real ""We have banned over 1,044,000 PUBG cheaters in January alone, unfortunately things continue to escalate.""

1,443.9,Recommended," June 18, 2017",4,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWDo you ever sit at home, thinking, ""I'm not angry enough right now... I need some rage in my life""? If you do, then buy this game immediately. If on the other hand you're trying to keep your stress levels down, you may want to reconsider this purchase.The game is a battle royale (100 men enter, 1 man leaves) scenario with randomised weapon drops on an isolated Slavic island. You parachute in, run and superman punch your way to the best loot available in your drop zone and prey you don't get shafted in the first five minutes like the scrub you're desperately trying not to be. If by some divine gift you manage to win, you're treated to the promise of a digital chicken dinner for what it's worth. If When you die you'll probably rage for a minute or two, convince yourself that your untimely death was unavoidable, that the game was lagging/gitching or that your killer was cheating before loading the game up again in some sort of twisted rage cycle...Things will happen in this game that will drive you insane and make you hate it at times. There are still lags and glitches in this game which are unforgiveable in a competitive shooter and they will cause you to die/lose at times. It would be unfair of me to give a negative review because of this, especially considering the game's still in early access, but it's something to be aware of if you're a competitive kind of person that takes stats seriously.Apart from the whole rage/blood pressure thing though, the game is great. It looks great, it plays great, it has amazing moments in it, it's incredibly satisfying when a game goes well and it's a a great game to play either on solo or with friends. For me, the games positives definitely outweigh the negatives even in early access, and with a dev working on the game who is so involved, I'm hoping that things are only going to get better with this title."

Hearing a footstep outside your building and holding your breath waiting to see if they come inside, running through woods as you realise the blue is coming to get you - fantastic.However, sad to say that since the new year every other game has ended with a death by a hacker. They don't even bother to hide it, you can see it directly via the kill cam afterwards. Aimbots, wall-hacks, ESP, recoil macros, shooting through walls, fences, mountains, headshots from a kilometre away - it has the absolute lot. Look at the leaderboards to see people who have been there for ages with insane k/d ratios.It's a massive pity as the hacking is currently ruining a great game.

113,103.0,Not Recommended, January 21,4,"Could be a fun game on the occasions where there aren't hackers in-game, but those games are about 50/50. With the growing popularity of the title right now, it is a hot-bed for hackers as of the time of this review (Jan 2018). The devs are no-doubt working on it, but I'd hold-off on purchasing this garbage fire until the hacking is gotten under control. It is particularly excruciating in a title such as this where you must spend a good portion of the session searching for gear and exploring the map. Finding you ideal set-up, simply for you and your team to be shot from outside of the effective range of a weapon, through a wall, without using their sight is particualrly rage enducing."
193,831.2,Recommended," August 17, 2017",4,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWIt's fun, but it has some real flaws.Netcode isn't great and probably never will be.Hit reg is pretty bad.Client-authoritative, which means that if a client tells the server that it hit someone, the server agrees, no matter if there's houses, trees or ground in between.Any type of lag (my client, server or opponents' client) makes that terrible. Peaking and moving into cover in crucial moments may have dire consequences.I still have a lot of fun, and it gets my heart pounding at times. The game is a decent mix of strategy and RNG ♥♥♥♥ery.

I think the combat is on point, the gameplay is perfect and the community is just the perfect amount of cancer.That being said, when I'm able to go to Twitch and watch streams of relatively known streamers complaing about supposed stream sniping with no grounds or even reporting to the Dev's that they are being harassed, and there are actual bans coming out of it, I know that something is wrong. This became even more apparent when I looked at the recent reviews and 7/10 of them were talking about streamers, most commonly StoneMountain64, getting them banned for reasons of ""harassment"" or ""stream sniping."" After watching his stream for awhile, I saw just how often he would throw around these accusations and it was disapointing to me. The fact that the Dev's are actually banning players on this guys word is appalling to me.Until the Dev's take a second and realise that just because somebody streams their game to the internet and they want to stay on good terms with the majority, they can't begin banning their community without sufficient evidence of a breach of terms.I hope in the future I can change my review to the positive that this game deserves. Until that time, I'll continue avoiding every streamer I can.Also, ♥♥♥♥ this game until they region lock it.

The game is horribly optimized for running on Unreal Engine 4, The gunplay, while interesting, is shoddy at best with the client side hit detection not catching everything it should. Some guns are almost completely unplayable, like shotguns and pistols. The worst part, however, is the rampant hacking that happens almost every game.

The main drawback with popular shooters is hackers. And now that PUBG is the most played shooter out there, if you are going to buy this game, expect to see allot of them. They say they have an anticheat going banning people, take it with a grain of salt. Valve, which is a firm with considerable more resources than Bluehole hasn't been able to do anything about cheaters in CS GO for 4 years now, besides the ocassional ban wave every few months that literally does nothing. Don't expect Bluehole's anticheat to be any better."

They run at less than 5FPS at the beginning of the match, causing immense lag and desync for the first 10 minutes. The fully client-side hit detection doesn't help matters either.It only gets slightly better after those first 10 minutes ,but the server tickrate never seems to get to the target of 30 until there's just a few players left and you actually have a chance of some fun gun battles that don't feel like bovine feces. Unless you end up fighting some warping, high ping player, that still manages to hit you just fine. The servers seem to accept any kind of garbage and nonsense the clients send it, so expect to get run over by cars that can drive through walls, or that aren't even close to hitting you.The client is just as terribly optimized as the the server. Low FPS, second-long stutters, random FPS drops, crashes. The web-based menu system is completely unreliable and riddled with bugs. It even has a reload button so you can attempt to get to see all your squad mates."

Whether you all see it as that or not doesn't justify it. The steering is sloppy and overly chaotic, the audio has changed from understandable to in your face, the sights are confusing (I'm aware people claim it is realistic, but it makes for very poor gameplay), the HUD looks like it's made out of playdough (in other words, childish), the game still promotes players with poorer internet as the desync is disguisting, and everything else is just the cherry on top.

I'll only say that this game is damn amazing. It's one of those games you just have to play one more round of before quitting. I'm proving my own point by writing this review at 5 am after a 7 hour session of playing. Addictive, fun, exciting and also requires both mechanical skill and a lot of brainwork for you to have a good round. Even the best players don't win most of their games. Every kill feels satisfactory and getting that winning screen never gets old. I also love the fact that you don't have to invest all your time to playing for you to do well; works well for me, as I'm quite busy and can't play as much as I used to and I'd like. I didn't pay for the game - my friend gifted it to me for my birthday a few months ago, but even if I did pay full price for the game, I would recommend it. This is probably the second early access game I've clocked over 100h of (the other one being Dota2). Don't get frightened by the game being in early access; it doesn't even feel like it is an early access title. They could release the game now and I'd be fully content with the product. The dev team is the best I've encountered since Tripwire somewhere between '07 and '09. They care about their game and their customers. Can't ask for more than that.

Whilst yes, it is badly optimised and unplayable in certain large cities, it has huge potential and I've gotta say it's the best Battle Royale game out there at the moment!If you have a pretty solid PC, get it and it should be playable. If you've not, maybe hang back a few months or so until the game gets some patches.I've got a I5 6500 and GTX 1060 and I'm getting pretty good FPS, between 30 to around 90 with it dipping to around 20 fps.This game is very enjoyable and if there's anyone out there wondering what it's like compared to H1Z1, its like 100000x better, like so much better. If your still uncertain, watch some streamers playing it, but it really is a very fun game.Good luck everyone! May the odds be ever in your favour! ;)"

Hearing a footstep outside your building and holding your breath waiting to see if they come inside, running through woods as you realise the blue is coming to get you - fantastic.However, sad to say that since the new year every other game has ended with a death by a hacker. They don't even bother to hide it, you can see it directly via the kill cam afterwards. Aimbots, wall-hacks, ESP, recoil macros, shooting through walls, fences, mountains, headshots from a kilometre away - it has the absolute lot. Look at the leaderboards to see people who have been there for ages with insane k/d ratios.It's a massive pity as the hacking is currently ruining a great game. Don't waste your money until they have sorted this out."

I think the combat is on point, the gameplay is perfect and the community is just the perfect amount of cancer.That being said, when I'm able to go to Twitch and watch streams of relatively known streamers complaing about supposed stream sniping with no grounds or even reporting to the Dev's that they are being harassed, and there are actual bans coming out of it, I know that something is wrong. This became even more apparent when I looked at the recent reviews and 7/10 of them were talking about streamers, most commonly StoneMountain64, getting them banned for reasons of ""harassment"" or ""stream sniping."" After watching his stream for awhile, I saw just how often he would throw around these accusations and it was disapointing to me. The fact that the Dev's are actually banning players on this guys word is appalling to me.Until the Dev's take a second and realise that just because somebody streams their game to the internet and they want to stay on good terms with the majority, they can't begin banning their community without sufficient evidence of a breach of terms.I hope in the future I can change my review to the positive that this game deserves. Until that time, I'll continue avoiding every streamer I can.Also, ♥♥♥♥ this game until they region lock it. The amount of times I've died to laggy Asian players on U.S. servers is beginning to outnumber the times I've died to someone on the same continent as me."

With the growing popularity of the title right now, it is a hot-bed for hackers as of the time of this review (Jan 2018). The devs are no-doubt working on it, but I'd hold-off on purchasing this garbage fire until the hacking is gotten under control. It is particularly excruciating in a title such as this where you must spend a good portion of the session searching for gear and exploring the map. Finding you ideal set-up, simply for you and your team to be shot from outside of the effective range of a weapon, through a wall, without using their sight is particualrly rage enducing."

Peaking and moving into cover in crucial moments may have dire consequences.I still have a lot of fun, and it gets my heart pounding at times. The game is a decent mix of strategy and RNG ♥♥♥♥ery.

349,346.8,Recommended," December 20, 2017",4,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWPUBG is a survival game, where up to 100 people are thrown in to an abandoned island and they fight it out, until there is a lone survivor.

Especially in the End Game / Late GameTotally recommend this gameThere is still some small glitches and bugs, but they will probably be fixed in the future !Overall: 9/10"
49,219.1,Not Recommended, January 11,4,"Alright, so, this is a hard to write review, as I love this game and find it very fun, but it has plenty of problems and issues. My final verdict is very mixed, but nonetheless, I'll try to make this a good, and full, review.So, an overview.(For those who don't really know what PUBG is)PUBG is a battle-royal-styled shooter, where (at most) one hundred players are pitted against one another to be the last man (or team, if you're one of those weird people that have friends) standing. You parachute from a plane, land where you want, and then loot what you can to protect yourself from other players. Okay, simple enough. The game has several guns, giving you some choice for how you'd like to play; everything from an over-under double barrel to a L115 rifle are available Classics like the AKM, M16, and even a trench shotgun are up for grabs; so the game’s got fun guns, all of which are nicely balanced. As of writing this, two maps are available to be fought on: Erangal and Miramar. Erengal is a lush, green-filled map with forests, a few plains, and rolling hills—all surrounded by an ocean. Miramar is an arid desert-y map with rather treacherous terrain and large cities, being quite a playground for snipers as I’ve come to learn. Both the maps are perfected with tons of detail, giving you a true feeling of stalking through an abandoned city, knowing you could get shot from any building you pass by.Alright, so now that you know what PUBG is, time to talk about what makes it extremely fun in my eyes—and likely many others.The firearms in this game are all satisfying to use, have plenty of recoil, and sound pretty realistic. Bolt-action rifles have a wonderful CRACK! to their sound, the automatic rifles and SMGs sound threatening and punchy, and the LMGs sound formidable. While it’s no Battlefield 1 sound design, it is definitely nothing to laugh at, and is actually very impressive compared to many other games of a similar caliber.The game looks very pretty, and—at least on my screen—has little graphical breaks. I have a GTX 1050 Ti, and while it’s no Titan or some crap, it’s pretty powerful and serviceable, and allows the game to run a smooth 60 frames or more if I sacrifice the quality of shadows; which I don't even notice much loss in terms of quality. The textures are phenomenal, the foliage is well detailed, and the animations are very well made and flowing—though, the bolt action rifles look a bit stiff in third person, but it’s not like you’ll be firing without looking through your scope.The raw gameplay itself is two things: thrilling, and satisfying. Personally, I find this game is most enjoyable when you put yourself into your gameplay… truly immersing yourself into the atmosphere of being hunted from God knows where, and even hunting people yourself. The thrill of surviving and fighting, outsmarting your enemies, flying by a town on a motorcycle while a rain of lead trails behind you… all those edge-of-your-seat moments are what I keep coming back for. While I have only won a game once on my own and once with my boyfriend, I find winning is just a nice bonus on top of the firefights and satisfying kills you rack up by the time you meet your fate, or take the head of your last victim. But, even if you’re just here to screw around with your buddies, or screw around on your own, PUBG is great for those, and is even encouraged to be played that way.Alright… now that I’ve praised this game, let me tell you why I wouldn't recommend buying it… ironic despite what I told you, but please, be patient.Oh my Lord, it was a mess—and is still very much a mess. Servers crashing, bandwidth being stretched to its limits, the game lagging or not even loading for people when they join a game… if you weren't told this is a release, you’d think this is still a very good-looking Alpha version. I, and many, MANY others, believe that the team behind PUBG was far too impatient, or rushed, or whatever, and the game has an obscene amount of bugs; too many of those bugs are game-breaking.This is mixed, as there are tons of cool YouTubers making small fame off this game, plenty of funny people in lobbies, and some lobbies that are nothing but silence—which is music to some people’s ears. HOWEVER. There are also a lot of people who just yell or scream, play terrible music at ear-piercing volumes, or connect to different geographical regions just to annoy the Hell out of people (a lot of North American and European players seem to be complaining about floods of Asian players who are just trolling, or abusing their high-latency—which brings me to my next point).Simply: it's awful. I’m talking launch-of-Battlefield-4 awful. If a guy’s in close range or sitting still and you’re a fine shot, you shouldn't have many problems—the issues are in actual firefights, where you shoot at someone, they notice, and return fire. While at times, the netcode won't shove a hot Kalashnikov barrel up your butt, but if someone’s either using their high ping to their advantage, or you get an unlucky streak, a bullet may just somehow collide with your face and you won't even have a second to react. While, yes, I understand people can get lucky and just happen to put their sights right on your noggin, it’s a little… stretched at times. The death cams aren't the most accurate in terms of replaying exact mouse-movements, and are really just for uncovering obvious hackers. The bugs sometimes it seems a bit obscene, and often you will find you’ve been shot despite being behind cover.So, with ALL that being said, let me make my point. This game has plenty of awesome potential, and is a blast when it actually works as planned. The crew behind the game has acknowledged their mistake in it’s hasty release and has been working since day 1 to fix the issues (the situation has seemed to improve, but, this is bound to change). At the very least, it’s admirable these guys are attempting to fix the many issues plaguing the game, but all in all, I think it’s still too unstable to be considered a safe purchase—thirty USD can be a bit hefty for some people, and for a game that may or may not function properly, it’s especially risky.This game, by itself in core values, is a fantastic game. Thrilling, satisfying, and most importantly, fun, PUBG is a great title… but now, because of the bogged performance for many people and hasty release, I don't think it’s too sound of a purchase. If you have faith in your PC and internet connection, then maybe go ahead and give it a try.And, if you read all that, then good on you for caring about your game purchases, and be sure to check back as the game is continued to be updated and patched: hopefully it’ll become all it should be, and perhaps, even more."

They market this as an E-Sport game.This game is actually pretty damn fun, especially with friends, and it's also hella addicting.But there's a ♥♥♥♥ ton of problems.PROS- Great, well thought out gun mechanics- Large amounts of guns, attachments, and vehicles (vehicles on Mirimar are lit)- Addicting, fun gameplay- Fast matchmaking times (when it works)- Intense as ♥♥♥♥ sometimes- 1.0 added a lot. A new map, new vehicles, new weapons. Great!- They made Miramar better?- I learnt a bit of Chinese.CONS- 10hz. It's an esport game, and it goes 10hz. (Which really shows sometimes as well, especially when there's a lot of people around)- Terrible draw distance allows you to see through certain points in some trees if you're far enough away. (I'm on ultra, I can see through some trees 50m+)- The massive amount of hackers right now. Sometimes getting 1 every 3 games. Edit: disabling reshade does not count as anti-cheat- Inconsistent. Sometimes shotguns take half someones health 50 metres away and sometimes shotguns take half someones health point blank. Sometimes you get instantly killed from a AK headshot even though you have a Level 2 helmet and full health, but when you headshot someone with an AK with a level 1 helmet they don't die. Could also tie in with the 10hz con, or a new con, hit registration!- Hit registration! Could also be server de-sync.- De-sync!- Parachuting. Broken, buggy, laggy, not good.- No bullet penetration. Fences act like bullet proof glass.- Bugs. In the lobby and in game. Sometimes the lobby breaks so hard with a squad that it'll take 1 hour to START finding a game.- 1.0 changed a lot. For better and for worse. They changed parachuting for some reason. Now it's just inconsistent. The constrast and sharpening change makes people in the shadows harder to spot and it just makes it look worse. Also, it used to be a lot less laggy before 1.0.- Loot spawn. You get some precious loot spawning on top of unreachable crates. Also, some loot spawns in late, and when that happens to you, it usually ends up being fatal for you.- Game crashing.- World design. Maps have an abundance of cover some places, and in others (where you actually get shot) absolutely no cover. On Erangal there's 2 types of trees. These thick♥♥♥♥♥ones, where you're covered from a 90 degree angle, and these ♥♥♥♥in' useless ones, which show off half of your body to the enemy. Don't even worry about cover on the new map though. Only cover you'll get besides buildings is 1, maybe 2 rocks in a barren wasteland.- Optimization. It was great at the start of 1.0! Used to get 60-50 FPS on Very low, 1440p, then after the update, 70-60 FPS on Medium, 1440p (with a GTX 1060 and i5-6600k). Now it's back to 60-40. Also, crashing!- Crashing!- ""We'll put in no microtransactions"" Proceeded to put in microtransactions- ""Instead of fixing these, let's put some ♥♥♥♥in' clothes in, because money!""- Grenades. The red line that shows you where the nade will go is as accurate as a ♥♥♥♥ing blind archer. Also, it's consistent as ♥♥♥♥. You throw a nade 1 foot away from a guy and he doesn't die, yet someone throws a nade 5 metres away from you and you die instantly.- Why the ♥♥♥♥ don't you add the new guns and vehicles to ♥♥♥♥ing Erangel you♥♥♥♥♥♥♥-███░░████░░██░░███░░██░░█░░██░░█░███░░█░░░░░█░░█░░█░██░████░░█░░░░█░██░░█░░█░░█░█░███░░█░████░░██░░███░░██░░█░░██░░░░░██░░░██░░█░░██░░░░█░░█░█░░░░███░░░░█░░█░█░░░░█░█████░░██░░░██░░█░░█░██░░█░░█░███░█░░█░░███░░░░████░░█░░██░█░█░░██░░░░█░░█░░█░░█░██░████░██░░█░░█░███░█░░█░█░░█I'd be fine with half of these, if this was still in early access.It's not.And pretty much all of these were a problem in early access.10/10 perfect esport ready gameI'll update if they fix this.Edit: Added new consEdit 2: There was an anti-cheat update, however I have yet to see a change.Edit 3: Seems like everyday I add a new con."

With the promise of higher framerates, a more mature graphics engine, and the potential for Nvidia SLI support, many players are drawn to PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS seeking a refreshing experience. Unfortunately, this game largely fails to improve upon any of the aforementioned title's performance, and leaves any enthusiast with the familiar taste of poor framerates, stuttering, artifacting, and crashing. Explosive titles such as PUBG are important reminders that engine integration, optomization, and validation simply must come first, before other superficial improvements are made. I look forward to the day that I am able to concede, and edit this review under the pretense that all of the performance issues have been resolved, but given the trend of the market, sadly, I cannot forsee this happening within a reasonable time."

The last 4 rounds I played with my squad, the ""players alive"" count was reduced down to about 25 people within the first 2 minutes. My squad, inside our own individual buildings, proceeded to be headshot one by one by the same person. The killfeeds (which show how the other player killed you) now mainly consist of people randomly firing automatic weapons into the air in your general location which results in them headshotting you and your entire squad. The developers are perfectly content with allowing hackers to ruin this game, because when they ban a hacker, they don't ban their computers - only their accounts. This means that banning a hacker will allow them to repurchase the game and continue to play so long as they create a new steam account, which results in them getting more revenue from hackers buying the game over and over. I'll be getting a new game soon, and my entire squad has vowed to quit alongside me so we can all join up and play a game that we can actually enjoy and win fairly.

But after putting in 143 hours im done and unable to recommend this game untill they fix all these issues im about to explain.First off this games net-code is a joke. while the standard for online Fps shooter type games is 60 tick or above (battlefield, CSGO, Overwatch, etc.) this game touts only 30 tick. that dips multiple times on a daily basis to 5 OR LESS. This causes you being unable to pick up loot along with horrid desync allowing you to be killed while already behind cover and dump and entire mag into someone while they just kill you instantly. This highly favours players with high ping making this next issue even worse.China. Now most of this games population is in china about 43% in just china alone. This in it self isn't an issue. The problem arises when Chinese players begin to stop playing on their own servers and flood into the NA servers. Not only does the lag give them a massive advantage but if you ever get one or two or even three in a squad with you, you are screwed. They're loud, you cant communicate anything with them and more often than not they'll just team kill you because you dont speak chinese. Not only this but Brendan Greene PUBG's creator has stated in interviews that %99 of cheats come from China. The simple fix is the just region lock the game. Chinese cant play on our servers and we cant play on theres. simple. But his head is so far up his♥♥♥♥♥that he calls any player that wants a region lock a racist.Please do not buy this game untill they put gameplay first and the cash cow of china last."

Unfortunately, this game largely fails to improve upon any of the aforementioned title's performance, and leaves any enthusiast with the familiar taste of poor framerates, stuttering, artifacting, and crashing. Explosive titles such as PUBG are important reminders that engine integration, optomization, and validation simply must come first, before other superficial improvements are made.

But when people are greifing the fun with screaming, playing up music really loud(see; destroying people's headphones) it just takes away the fun, yeah sure you can mute it but should it really be necessary?Once you land, you have about a couple of minutes to loot before the circle starts shrinking, at this point you have to be very strategic and watch out for other players, mostly you get a hold of a shotgun or a pistol but I would still not engage in fights.

89,239.8,Recommended," April 17, 2017",4,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWAfter the monopoly H1Z1 had in the battle royale genre, they became lazy and worked solely on microtransactions. Playerunknown left the project and began his own with a south korean team to back him up. Battlegrounds improves on what H1Z1 accomplished. More weapons, weapon attachments, a larger map, more immersive gameplay, more control of drop locations, future maps, weekly and monthly updates, future modding support, and absolutely no microtransactions. Only recently with the success of Battlegrounds did Daybreak finally release an update improving H1Z1's gameplay.There are some drawbacks to this game though. Although I have 8 GB RAM, i5 processor, and GTX 1070, I can hardly load up the buildings in the game at times. That is because that is all on the server's end, meaning if the servers aren't very optimized (which they aren't right now), you have the chance of landing in an area you haven't loaded up yet. Then you are forced to wait up to a whole minute for it to load. This can cost you the entire game, and is extremely frustrating when it happens.Even with this crippling con, I have still managed to have so much fun and excitement with this game. The moments of dropping in a town filled with people stuggling to find a weapon to wipe everyone out and survive, or running in a race against time trying to avoid the electric smoke right on your tail, or getting in a firefight with another team as the few people remaining. I've gotten as close as 3rd place, but my friends have actually won a game before. What's different about this game from countless others is I actually WANT to get first place because I love playing the game. Not because I need to unlock something, but because the game is just that good.I recommend this game, even in its current state. I say this because the great moments you will have in this game with your friends are much more impactful than the moments where you can't load something up.*If the game just doesn't work for you, you can either get your refund, or wait for the weekly updates to fix it.*"

Mid settings is so terrible you'll often mistaken bushes for players when using scopes or when driving.

If you want to use your scope/zoom in, it will take the game way too long, which is quite inconvenient since you die very quickly. I'm quite sure this has nothing to do with ""realism"", it's just bad programming.Gameplay:The gameplay can be quite thrilling. Really gets ruined by the unpolished engine, though.Although VERY boring when not playing with friends.Price and Microtransactions:As far as the money's concerned, this game just ♥♥♥♥♥ into its customer's face.The game is a LOT less polished than other multiplayer games like CS:GO/Overwatch and seriously lacks quality.I'd say it's a really fancy mod, but certainly nothing more than that. Henceforth, 30 Euros is WAY too much for this game and I really advise you not to buy this game at full price, but rather wait for a sale. Not because the game isn't fun, but because you shouldn't support greedy developers.Now guess what? THERE ARE MICROTRANSACTIONS! As if paying 30 Euros for an unfinished game wasn't enough!As you might be able to tell, the developers aren't exactly trying to hide the fact that they are trying to milk your wallet.All in all, if you really want this game, get it. I know many people who actually enjoy this. If you just want to play Battle Royale, play Fortnite (it's free).

Try as you might to reach rank #1, you will get headshotted from two kilometers away by a micro uzi that somehow managed to penetrate your level 3 helmet and a wall.""Better luck next time!"" the game proclaims. You frown and curse your luck, swearing that you'll do better next time. Surely with enough practice, you will develop leet skills on that level. Right?Meanwhile, the Chinese sweatshop worker who killed you has reaped enough points from his 20 kills to buy another crate or two, which he will sell on a 3rd party website to a gullible American buyer who just isn't willing to pay the 65 cents required to buy it legitimately from the Steam Market. He opens his crate like a lottery ticket, revealing his prize: Another crappy tank top. ""Curses,"" he thinks to himself. ""That vomit-yellow track suit that I've been pining for is just out of my grasp!"" So he buys another crate. And another. And apparently another, because those Chinese hackers are making big bucks and growing in number.Maybe you're thinking that it's all in my head, that I just need to ""git gud"". For a time, I also thought that might be the case. However, as I started to see more and more blatant examples of hacking (such as a half-naked female who absorbed an entire clip from my S12K and then teleported up the road), I decided to log into the test servers instead. The test servers do not allow anyone to keep their rewards, so there's absolutely no monetary incentive for hackers to be there. Lo and behold, I found myself on a server with people who acted like human beings instead of ruthless, efficient killing machines. I got four kills and earned my first chicken dinner. Guess I'm not so bad at the game after all.This is a sad state of affairs. PUBG is an enjoyable game that is being summarily ruined. Brendan ""Playerunknown"" Greene has acknowledged that hacking is a big problem; he has also released ban numbers that have broken previous Steam records. In he even said that they were banning six thousand cheaters a day, the majority of which are from China. And while six thousand might seem like a lot, PUBG now has , which means that six thousand is a tiny drop in the bucket. He has also stated that he takes a hard stance on hacking - Firm bans with no appeals. That's good, but it doesn't address the reason that hackers show up in the first place, which is to sell their crates. If he's really serious about the situation, he needs to shut down the crate market, period. To hell with the whales who bought $100 items to outfit their characters. If he wants to save the game's reputation, that's the only way.If you're a potential buyer and want some advice as to whether to play this game, I will tell you right now to , because there is no indication that the hacking will ever be properly addressed. The test servers can provide you with a hacker-free experience if you're okay with forfeiting your rewards, but those servers are extremely buggy and likely won't be around forever (they will probably disappear after the game is out of early access). Thus, if you play on the regular servers, you are guaranteed to encounter at least one hacker every time you play.Trust me, it's not your imagination.

208,274.0,Not Recommended, March 10,4,"*queue dramatic music* It's late in the match, everyone has invested over 20 minutes into this round and the tension is high. You've gained a strong defensive position and are getting closer and closer to victory. One by one the enemies fall until it's finally down to you and one other player. You're feeling the pressure and your heart is racing, but you've been paying attention and you know exactly what tree he's hiding behind. Victory is in your hands. You mentally prepare for this final fight. And then... You die... He stayed behind his cover and headshot you through the tree when trees can't even be shot through in this game.Welcome to Pubg!After well over 200 hours into this game, I sadly recommend that you not purchase this product. The core reason being the overwhelming number of cheaters that plague the community. There are also be some bugs and glitches such as car physics going wonky at times and taking damage while climbing walls. While the bugs may be annoying at times, they rarely have a huge impact on gameplay. But dying to cheaters every other game completely kills the fun over time.If you buy the game anyway I'm sure you'll have fun for a little while. Jumping into a town with +20 other people, you probably won't notice the cheaters much amongst all the chaos. And since you've only invested a couple minutes at most into that round it doesn't feel that bad when you die. But when you start getting to top 20, top 10, or even top 5 it hurts a whole lot more.I was able to look past the problem for a while but after so many near victories were stolen from me/and my team I've lost interest in taking the game seriously.It doesn't help that Blue Hole's method of dealing with cheaters is the same as what MMOs do with botters. Wait on banning their accounts long enough so that the cheaters will go buy new accounts. I'm sure this strategy makes Blue Hole a nice chunk of change but I think it will ultimately drive the legitimate players away."

It is absolutely ♥♥♥♥♥♥ being paired with some chinese ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who doesn't even speak english-Gunplay is mediocre. The gunplay really isn't that fun or great, and get's extremely frustrating with unrealistic forms of recoil with certain firearms-Loot spawning is awful. Seriously, why do god damn pants and shirts spawn? Spawning in this useless loot simply takes away from the useful loot and kills fps for no reason, and gives people a disadvantage because picking up and replacing their clothes is an unwanted option they have-Did I mention how much it crashes?-♥♥♥♥♥iest squad system, like ever. Squad leader can't even kick people from squad, squads glitch constantly, people are still in squad when they've been offline for like two ♥♥♥♥ing weeks, need I go on?-Vehicles are a nuisance more often than not. Many times I've been enjoying the game when for no ♥♥♥♥ing reason my car unrealistically explodes from a minor bump... seriously? Do you know how unrealistic vehicles exploding is in general, but exploding because of a god dAMN BUMP? Maybe if the vehicle got totaled, but dying and losing everything because you hit a bump is absurd.-Overpriced arcade game.. Seriously, they've made so much money charging 30 bucks per person for a game that any group of people with experience in UE4 could've made. It's disgraceful, this game deserves to be sold for 9.99-14.99 per copy.-Back to the anti-cheat, bans are AWFUL. I have a friend who was banned for STREAM SNIPING!? First off, he wasn't stream sniping, but second off, why ban people from a major game for stream sniping? People should know the god damned risk of streaming, and stream sniping shouldn't matter in big games like this. Could you imagine getting perm banned from Battlefield 1 for stream sniping? Exactly.-Back to optimization, when I have a PC that runs most games on Ultra with 90+ fps, why is buildings loading in an issue? And not just for me, many times I've had friends die because the god damn building won't load-Theres a lot more, but to the pros I guess?-Kinda fun a few matches at a time-Competitive-Creates amazing adrenaline-Winning is extremely satisfying-Sound effects are nice af-Game looks okayish-Leaderboard system is really nice-Map design is pretty good, with good balance between all maps-Skill/Tactic based-Can be terrifying, something that is AMAZINGIn conclusion, you're better off buying a nice hoodie or something, this game will make you more angry and sad than it will bring you enjoyment."

They contain several items that were actually shown many months in advance yet weren't available in the game. Several developer screenshots, the games loading screen and even the screenshots advertising the game here on the Steam Store show items that can only be permenantly obtained as part of the customization system via paid crates.Update on 1st Jan 2018: Game has now left early access, it's still a lot of fun...but i still can't recommend buying it.

208,274.0,Not Recommended, March 10,4,"*queue dramatic music* It's late in the match, everyone has invested over 20 minutes into this round and the tension is high. You've gained a strong defensive position and are getting closer and closer to victory. One by one the enemies fall until it's finally down to you and one other player. You're feeling the pressure and your heart is racing, but you've been paying attention and you know exactly what tree he's hiding behind. Victory is in your hands. You mentally prepare for this final fight. And then... You die... He stayed behind his cover and headshot you through the tree when trees can't even be shot through in this game.Welcome to Pubg!After well over 200 hours into this game, I sadly recommend that you not purchase this product. The core reason being the overwhelming number of cheaters that plague the community. There are also be some bugs and glitches such as car physics going wonky at times and taking damage while climbing walls. While the bugs may be annoying at times, they rarely have a huge impact on gameplay. But dying to cheaters every other game completely kills the fun over time.If you buy the game anyway I'm sure you'll have fun for a little while. Jumping into a town with +20 other people, you probably won't notice the cheaters much amongst all the chaos. And since you've only invested a couple minutes at most into that round it doesn't feel that bad when you die. But when you start getting to top 20, top 10, or even top 5 it hurts a whole lot more.I was able to look past the problem for a while but after so many near victories were stolen from me/and my team I've lost interest in taking the game seriously.It doesn't help that Blue Hole's method of dealing with cheaters is the same as what MMOs do with botters. Wait on banning their accounts long enough so that the cheaters will go buy new accounts. I'm sure this strategy makes Blue Hole a nice chunk of change but I think it will ultimately drive the legitimate players away."

82,380.8,Not Recommended," September 4, 2017",4,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWListen, I love this game, I truly do and from day 1 I had hopes that it would quickly make it out of early access. But I can tell you right now, that since the money came pouring in, it has in my opinion seemed to be lacking for as much as it's been sold. I can not recommend this game right now because they have pushed in the wrong directions, probably due to pressure from outside influences but the game is not nearly as polished as it should be at this point, they released a vaulting trailer what feels like forever ago, and have never mentioned it again, so at this point your character is still a slow moving moron who can run thousands of meters but can not scale a simple picket fence. The server desyncs constantly, cheaters are now rampant, and they had a competitive style tournament, which in my opinion showcased all the things that are wrong with this game at this point. Look I want them to pick it back up and finish it, maybe that just takes a lot more time than I anticipated but it seems that the pace for real progress has slowed and showy updates involving guns and maps are the ony foreseeable future. After being hopeful in more than one early access experience this is the one I thought would make it. Maybe it still will. But right now, it's a big steamy pile of frustrating sh*t. Go to youtube and watch the hackers, then play a game and feel like you aren't being cheated. I'm sure it's not every match, but it's every 3 matches probably. You aren't in game long enough to know for sure, until you just appear dead and wonder where in the holy crap did that come from. Due to the nature of the game you'll never know if it was legit or not legit. It just honestly seems like the early updates were fantastic and making real progress, and maybe they just did the easy stuff. Either way with the game wanting to go competitive it's time to address real issues in playability, hacker prevention, and addressing those matters."

It can make a player so f***** mad! Especially when game runs well and after the whole pregame, flight and some looting one dies by this stupid bug (which has to be one - since according to the damage list, a shotgun should not be able to kill a player with ONE shot! It is annoying - devs pls get some brains and fix this...- When fighting some people and you run behind a wall (massive - solid rock!), you can die 2-3 secs after that - lag? whatever it is... fix that! Or dont name this game 1.0 - when the actual code is still in the BETA.- What is the deal that a player CAN NOT chose what MAP he wants to play? You want to force players to play the stupid Miramar map, even if a player doesnt like it and wants to play Erangel? What is wrong with you guys? Let the player chose, or people will just re-ready the games and these will not be full as it is supposed to be.- What is the deal with the fps drops? Game doesnt look that amazing that it would require a high-end PC. Super Mario looks better than some of these ****** graphics and it runs on NINTENDO. Please get some good programmers and optimize the code, would be much appreciated!All in all:Fun game to play, but is still in the state of BETA - because of all the bugs and game behaviour - expecially hitboxes and shotgun, which is AWFUL.Won't play this ******* until some fixes are done and WILL NOT RECOMMEND to any friend."

89,239.8,Recommended," April 17, 2017",4,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWAfter the monopoly H1Z1 had in the battle royale genre, they became lazy and worked solely on microtransactions. Playerunknown left the project and began his own with a south korean team to back him up. Battlegrounds improves on what H1Z1 accomplished. More weapons, weapon attachments, a larger map, more immersive gameplay, more control of drop locations, future maps, weekly and monthly updates, future modding support, and absolutely no microtransactions. Only recently with the success of Battlegrounds did Daybreak finally release an update improving H1Z1's gameplay.There are some drawbacks to this game though. Although I have 8 GB RAM, i5 processor, and GTX 1070, I can hardly load up the buildings in the game at times. That is because that is all on the server's end, meaning if the servers aren't very optimized (which they aren't right now), you have the chance of landing in an area you haven't loaded up yet. Then you are forced to wait up to a whole minute for it to load. This can cost you the entire game, and is extremely frustrating when it happens.Even with this crippling con, I have still managed to have so much fun and excitement with this game. The moments of dropping in a town filled with people stuggling to find a weapon to wipe everyone out and survive, or running in a race against time trying to avoid the electric smoke right on your tail, or getting in a firefight with another team as the few people remaining. I've gotten as close as 3rd place, but my friends have actually won a game before. What's different about this game from countless others is I actually WANT to get first place because I love playing the game. Not because I need to unlock something, but because the game is just that good.I recommend this game, even in its current state. I say this because the great moments you will have in this game with your friends are much more impactful than the moments where you can't load something up.*If the game just doesn't work for you, you can either get your refund, or wait for the weekly updates to fix it.*"

Going into this review, I have put well over 200 hours into the game, having picked it up shortly after it made its way onto Steam Early Access and played it semi-regularly ever since. Over this time my opinion of PUBG has fluctuated significantly, going from adoration to contempt and everything in between. At the end of the day, it is hard to deny the game has a strong pull and is very addictive, offering up some of the highest highs gaming has to offer, while also allowing for some spectacular personal failures that might cause you to lose some sleep.continue reading [www.newgamenetwork.com]"

145,99.2,Not Recommended," November 14, 2017",4,"Don't get me wrong, I enjoy this game, however, that doesn't mean it's a good game at all. For those who don't want to read pros and cons, essentially, lazy devs, bad multiplayer system, devs lied, poor optimization.CONS:-Can't even set a map preferance?-Devs are lazy, and don't deserve even half the money they made off of this. They made the game in a fairly easy to use engine, and they made a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ framework and broken multiplayer game, and become absurdly rich simply because they were the first ones to make a triple AAA game completely for battle royale-Devs lied, and are scummy. They said they would keep micro transactions out of the game, but heerrree we are-Poor Optimization, game runs a lot ♥♥♥♥♥ier than it should, but doesn't even look that good-Buggy as ♥♥♥♥ for ""1.0"". Upon release of 1.0 my game crashed 8 times within the next 24 hours. The game constantly crashes, and I'm constantly running into game ruining bugs, such as getting stuck in a ♥♥♥♥ing barrel and losing the game to it.-Hackers are everywhere. This games anti cheat system is a god damn joke, I've ran into more hackers in this game than I have nearly every game I play combined. (More hackers in 70 hours than in 7000 hours of gameplay??)-Region lock china. This game has a♥♥♥♥♥♥LOAD of Chinese players and they would be perfectly fine only playing with other chinese players. It is absolutely ♥♥♥♥♥♥ being paired with some chinese ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who doesn't even speak english-Gunplay is mediocre. The gunplay really isn't that fun or great, and get's extremely frustrating with unrealistic forms of recoil with certain firearms-Loot spawning is awful. Seriously, why do god damn pants and shirts spawn? Spawning in this useless loot simply takes away from the useful loot and kills fps for no reason, and gives people a disadvantage because picking up and replacing their clothes is an unwanted option they have-Did I mention how much it crashes?-♥♥♥♥♥iest squad system, like ever. Squad leader can't even kick people from squad, squads glitch constantly, people are still in squad when they've been offline for like two ♥♥♥♥ing weeks, need I go on?-Vehicles are a nuisance more often than not. Many times I've been enjoying the game when for no ♥♥♥♥ing reason my car unrealistically explodes from a minor bump... seriously? Do you know how unrealistic vehicles exploding is in general, but exploding because of a god dAMN BUMP? Maybe if the vehicle got totaled, but dying and losing everything because you hit a bump is absurd.-Overpriced arcade game.. Seriously, they've made so much money charging 30 bucks per person for a game that any group of people with experience in UE4 could've made. It's disgraceful, this game deserves to be sold for 9.99-14.99 per copy.-Back to the anti-cheat, bans are AWFUL. I have a friend who was banned for STREAM SNIPING!? First off, he wasn't stream sniping, but second off, why ban people from a major game for stream sniping? People should know the god damned risk of streaming, and stream sniping shouldn't matter in big games like this. Could you imagine getting perm banned from Battlefield 1 for stream sniping? Exactly.-Back to optimization, when I have a PC that runs most games on Ultra with 90+ fps, why is buildings loading in an issue? And not just for me, many times I've had friends die because the god damn building won't load-Theres a lot more, but to the pros I guess?-Kinda fun a few matches at a time-Competitive-Creates amazing adrenaline-Winning is extremely satisfying-Sound effects are nice af-Game looks okayish-Leaderboard system is really nice-Map design is pretty good, with good balance between all maps-Skill/Tactic based-Can be terrifying, something that is AMAZINGIn conclusion, you're better off buying a nice hoodie or something, this game will make you more angry and sad than it will bring you enjoyment."

While I don't enjoy Fortnite that much, Epic has kicked this game's♥♥♥♥♥in terms of development process and making an actual polished and fluid gaming experience. It takes Blue Balls longer to fix a loading screen crash glitch than it took Blizzard to fix the Mercy meta in Overwatch. This studio can't even lay out a proper roadmap with dates, it's just ""♥♥♥♥ it it's coming this year at some point.""Hit registration is so hit or miss, that when I'm scoped on a guy with a Kar98, I'm not sure if my shot is even going to connect with his body. This game encourages people to sit in houses the entire match going from window to window and picking off people who play more aggressive. The maps are so huge that you can go 20 minutes without seeing a soul, and this is especially bad with the new maps. Vehicle physics are ♥♥♥♥ed; you hit an air pocket on a hill and get sent flying through the air and explode into a fiery ball of metal. The lag at the beginning of every single match is still present, as it takes me 3 drags of an energy drink to actually get it into my inventory. Countless bugs and glitches that have been around since the early days of early access are still present. But thank God that they added emotes, paid lootboxes, and an esports scene for this piece of garbage. Actual GOTY nominee btw."
286,236.1,Not Recommended, January 14,4,Although I would love to give this game a positive review due to the part I enjoy the game. I HATE when games lock possible gameplay elements behind a Pay to Win concept. Simply put I cannot love a game that use Keys on Crates in their game. So this game does not meet my quality standards for a game.Gameplay 65/100Sound&Music Sound 65/100 Music 30/100 because there is only one soundtrack lower rank. Soundtrack only menu.Visuals 50/100Overall 50/100Garbage Crates Rating -1000000/100I would avoid buying this game until they remove this key system in the game.Also late addition to my review. There are no region locked servers or ping locked so it can also lead to a ton of LAG SHIELDING. Which is a negitive.New addition If someone is laying down in the grass and someone is sniping you from distance they don't see any grass. That is gameplay breaking. I had to knock points off this game for that.As of Update #6 I still say everything I have said so far is accurate.

Im not joking SCREAMING into the mics. you can communicate with them or plan anything with your team unless you speak chinese making the game no fun. They are also not good at the game on the NA servers there ping is way to high most of the time they lag all over the place. I got killed when a chinese player shot a wall thats how laggy they were. CHEATERS. omg so many cheaters. I reported a guy for no recoil, he knew where everyone was, he snapped to the target instantly, had some sort of auto clicker to fire the sniper like a machine gun and he ruined the round for everyone getting only headshots. I still have that replay saved. This player was chinese and was a cheater. the reason they come to our servers is to not play with their own screaming and cheating players, but the cheaters all followed them to the NA server and other servers. Nothing against them but its just not worth buying until there is some sort of server lock. Keep the money or play at your own risk."

It's not a survival game - it's run and gun game which with every minute of the match turns into walking and camping simulator. It doesn't have any learning curve and it's totally random - you won't get better with every minute spended in this game - it's all about luck. Perfect game for bad players and casual gamers.Ps. I couldn't aim down sight in this game without having double click right mouse button in first person perspective.

126,284.8,Not Recommended," December 16, 2017",4,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWHello my PUBG minions,I will be reviewing this gem of a video game in hopes that others read before purchasing. Many fanboys will probably yell and hate this review but don't worry! I do say positive things about the game. Let's start out with a quick compliment sandwhich... What is that you ask? Well, it's where I'll say something ♥♥♥♥♥♥ about the game followed by a good thing, and last but not least another cruddy thing.1. RNG shouldn't play as big of a role as it does.2. The way matchmaking works is pretty neat.3. Why does the hit detection feel like I'm ""Rolling The Dice""?I wouldn't consider myself to be ""Elite"" at FPS or tactical shooters... But I'm pretty dang good. I will now write a small review for those interested in how the game works/functions.Let's start from the very beginning:Signing on. Sweet ""sign in"" is pretty easy and the party system works great. There were some kinks but they were resolved for the most part. Let's name our character/persona. Okay this is a one time thing that you will NEVER be able to change. I can understand that, but still... maybe for in game currency allow us to change it? Anyway, moving on to character customization... Very minimal in aspects to features. Okay, I get it... If you enjoy the FPS variant of the game (which I do), you will hardly ever see your character anyway so it's not a big deal. If you are someone who likes to customize your character then don't get your hopes up! Let's dive into the actual gameplay now.Gameplay is very underwhelming. You load into the game on a small island with 99 other players. You get to run around for about a minute punching everything in sight. I would start by turning off the communications because every single lobby will be little kids screaming or very loud music blasting through the headset. Okay, the minute of wait time has expired and we get teleported onto a huge cargo plane. SWEET! At this point, you must have to make the most important decision in the entire game. You have two options. One, you can drop out of the plane in a deserted location in hopes to being able to fully gear up and play for the long haul (MUST FIND VEHICLE). Or two, risk it for the biscuit and drop into a town/location where you will quickly fight for your life and possibly benefit after winning. Say you are a risk-taker, which most people are. You decide to land into a huge populated town. As your buggy parachute slowly rips off your back you must take control and quickly find some sort of weapon to fight your opponents with. It's at this point in the game where ""Your Dice Roll"" must be higher than the opponents in order to get better weaponry. Don't pick up items too quickly or the game will think you are having a seizure and it will just leave the weapons/ammo on the ground. This isn't about speed right? Anyway, you manage to escape your first victim and find yourself a nice assault rifle. Let's skip ahead to a scenario that you will become very familiar with if you manage to survive the first thirty seconds of the lagfest butt♥♥♥♥ery.Hit detection/Armor. In PUBG there are two different forms of protection and three tiers for each form.1. Lvl 1-3 Helmet2. Lvl 1-3 VestI'm not sure how the hit detection works or if it's realistic. I haven't decided to spend the time reading patch notes for this game yet (Probably should). When shooting at someone with an assault rifle or any gun for that matter, it will take more bullets according to what armor said victim has on. Okay, understandable... It's logic, a higher armor takes more bullets... WE GET IT... It just seems like it adds way more to the ""RNG"" aspect of the game and makes it much more ""luck"" dependent. For instance, in multiple occasions I shot a man with an M16 four times in the chest and twice in the legs and he is still hauling♥♥♥♥♥to dive behind a rock. He sticks a needle in his arm and turns into the INCREDIBLE HULK peeks me and hits me three times with his M16 and pierces my Lvl 1. Vest and kills me after I hit him twice more. (It only takes 5 seconds to regain your health back to 75%. (If you were lucky enough to find that juicy medkit) Hmmmm. I honestly don't mind the fact that there are armor and helmets in the game, but maybe just make a single tier of them. That would be more fair I think. Better yet, maybe just having no armor or helmet would be better. Let's move on to positioning and map control.Okay, Battle Royale! A game mode which is becoming more popular. You have a no-no zone which every so often closes in from the outer edges of the map. I actually like this feature... well, I like the idea of it. It was implemented very poorly in this game. Here is the reasoning behind my ""OPINION"". This so called, ""circle of death zone"" closes in very slowly after a certain amount of in game time which puts you in a situation. That situation is, you have to go into the ""fair play"" zone or the magical blue gas will choke you out slowly and kill you. Cool, pretty neat concept. It eliminates people from sitting behind a table upstairs in grandma's house for five hours while you look for them. GOT IT. The problem I have with it is, it doesn't do enough damage initially when you get caught in it, and it takes WAY too long in between cycles of getting smaller. I'm not sure if maybe the map is just too large or the circle isn't proportioned correctly. Anyway, back to the first thing I spoke about when you are in the giant airplane at the start. IF you ""rolled the dice"" correctly you may have hit the jackpot and landed inside of the initial circle's ""fair play"" zone. Where then you can manage to find yourself a weapon and sit in grandma's house until the circle shrinks and more dice rolls are required. If you were a poor soul who didn't land in the circle of happiness then... well... enjoy running! You will be running for a majority of the game. There is a 50/50 chance that you get sandwiched between another group running from behind you and the current guy who has been running in front of you. If you are fortunate enough to find a vehicle then you better put the pedal to the metal and get into grandma's house in the happy zone. I mean, sure... you can strategize ways to go about getting into the circle earlier on foot but it will effect the way your looting works. Either way, it's just a great concept that was implemented very poorly in my opinion.OVERALL, this game does have some potential but at it's current state is IN MY OPINION a buggy pile of steaming hot garbage. The main things that I personally think need fixing are as follows:-Hit Detection-Latency-Vehicle Movement/Player Movement-Inventory OptimizationThings that I think are okay/decent so far:-Lobby system-Matchmaking-Some of the menu optionsI would rate this game a solid 3/10 maybe 4/10 on a lucky day...Hope you all enjoyed the review and REMEMBER, SOME PEOPLE ENJOY THIS GAME AND THAT'S OKAY. EVERYONE IS ENTITLED TO THEIR OPINION. IT'S JUST NOT FOR ME!"

I would recommend waiting for this game to be fixed before putting in money to it.Recent reviews have stated that ""every game has their impurities"" and while that is right every game does have its flaws. I believe the devs aren't focused on what actually needs to be addressed.. Poor optimization, Awful Servers, and yes.. the stream sniping epidemic.. Many many people are getting falsely banned for stream sniping..

Once landing on the ground, your objective is to get into a building or structure and find a weapon to often combat other nearby players, however the game lags so hard for the first 10-30 seconds that opening doors and looting take two-three times the time it should normally take, as the doors take extra time to open and items take several seconds to be placed into your inventory. The buggy servers can also have a major impact on combat, which I will discuss below this.-The main reason combat is frustrating as hell is mainly due to the hitreg, which is abysmal. I've noticed quite often that each time I have been shot on occasion the bullet that could have killed me, that clearly hit my chest does no damage to me or the vest, which gave me time to get into cover or return fire and kill the enemy player(s).-The gameplay can be quite boring, especially during midgame and even more so if you dropped in an area with few players in your vicinity. You can avoid this problem by dropping into areas that 20-40% of other players drop off at every round, such as the school shooting range. But this often gets you killed and rewards you with few points anyway.-The BP/reward system most ♥♥♥♥ing annoying thing about this game. You are rewarded many times more points for placing higher than being active within the game and fighting other players. Thats right. You can camp houses without having killed a single player until you finally die around top 15 and be rewarded with more points than someone who gets 3-5 kills and dies early on for at least trying. Theres no reward for skill, only for being a patient buttmonkey.-The game is riddled with hackers. One in every five to seven games I either witness or am killed by someone running faster than some vehicles can drive who also happens to have walls and/or aimbot.

I remember reading one occasion where a player was banned simply for driving and honking his horn unfortunately nearby a streamer, where he claimed the player was ""harrassing"" him.-Countless other bugs and glitches that are relatively minor (i.e. vehicles not flipping if turned on side or upside down, UI freezing/lagging, not being matched with other random players if auto-matching is enabled for duos/squads).

331,289.2,Not Recommended, April 12,4,"The most recent changes to make this game faster paced fall in line with the creator's eyeing the differences between them and Fortnite instead of fixing the inherent problems with the game since day 1. So I felt like I would add my exit reviewSuch problems include:- Poor Netcode (Latency is so bad at least 30-45% of the time and I am running a hardwired CAT6 connection directly to my ISP's modem which is giving me approcimately 9ms of latency to their headend)- Poor loot prioritization when trying to pick up equipment in game (""fixed"" by removing clothing as drops within the game)- God awful optimization (It was a struggle for them to give me a solid 60fps @1080 when I have an i7 3470K, GTX 1070, 16GB RAM, and PUBG was installed on an SSD (I have done a number of optimizations to my CPU's settings, PUBG config file changes, router QOS settings, and steam settings)I kept telling myself that it would get better and that they would finally focus on these problems and pour resources into improving the technical shortfalls of the game, but I was wrong. They have almost primarily focused on such gaming frivolties as emotes, lootcrates, a new map that no one asked for, more cosmetics, a mobile version of their game, and a console port.I am done, if I wanted to play Fortnite I would play Fortnite. PUBG had the essence of something much more enjoyable to me (If you like/prefer Fortnite that is alright by me, it is just a matter of different tastes), and every patch drives it closer to a poorer copy of something I don't want to play.The game has been uninstalled and I am not going to Fortnite.

126,284.8,Not Recommended," December 16, 2017",4,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWHello my PUBG minions,I will be reviewing this gem of a video game in hopes that others read before purchasing. Many fanboys will probably yell and hate this review but don't worry! I do say positive things about the game. Let's start out with a quick compliment sandwhich... What is that you ask? Well, it's where I'll say something ♥♥♥♥♥♥ about the game followed by a good thing, and last but not least another cruddy thing.1. RNG shouldn't play as big of a role as it does.2. The way matchmaking works is pretty neat.3. Why does the hit detection feel like I'm ""Rolling The Dice""?I wouldn't consider myself to be ""Elite"" at FPS or tactical shooters... But I'm pretty dang good. I will now write a small review for those interested in how the game works/functions.Let's start from the very beginning:Signing on. Sweet ""sign in"" is pretty easy and the party system works great. There were some kinks but they were resolved for the most part. Let's name our character/persona. Okay this is a one time thing that you will NEVER be able to change. I can understand that, but still... maybe for in game currency allow us to change it? Anyway, moving on to character customization... Very minimal in aspects to features. Okay, I get it... If you enjoy the FPS variant of the game (which I do), you will hardly ever see your character anyway so it's not a big deal. If you are someone who likes to customize your character then don't get your hopes up! Let's dive into the actual gameplay now.Gameplay is very underwhelming. You load into the game on a small island with 99 other players. You get to run around for about a minute punching everything in sight. I would start by turning off the communications because every single lobby will be little kids screaming or very loud music blasting through the headset. Okay, the minute of wait time has expired and we get teleported onto a huge cargo plane. SWEET! At this point, you must have to make the most important decision in the entire game. You have two options. One, you can drop out of the plane in a deserted location in hopes to being able to fully gear up and play for the long haul (MUST FIND VEHICLE). Or two, risk it for the biscuit and drop into a town/location where you will quickly fight for your life and possibly benefit after winning. Say you are a risk-taker, which most people are. You decide to land into a huge populated town. As your buggy parachute slowly rips off your back you must take control and quickly find some sort of weapon to fight your opponents with. It's at this point in the game where ""Your Dice Roll"" must be higher than the opponents in order to get better weaponry. Don't pick up items too quickly or the game will think you are having a seizure and it will just leave the weapons/ammo on the ground. This isn't about speed right? Anyway, you manage to escape your first victim and find yourself a nice assault rifle. Let's skip ahead to a scenario that you will become very familiar with if you manage to survive the first thirty seconds of the lagfest butt♥♥♥♥ery.Hit detection/Armor. In PUBG there are two different forms of protection and three tiers for each form.1. Lvl 1-3 Helmet2. Lvl 1-3 VestI'm not sure how the hit detection works or if it's realistic. I haven't decided to spend the time reading patch notes for this game yet (Probably should). When shooting at someone with an assault rifle or any gun for that matter, it will take more bullets according to what armor said victim has on. Okay, understandable... It's logic, a higher armor takes more bullets... WE GET IT... It just seems like it adds way more to the ""RNG"" aspect of the game and makes it much more ""luck"" dependent. For instance, in multiple occasions I shot a man with an M16 four times in the chest and twice in the legs and he is still hauling♥♥♥♥♥to dive behind a rock. He sticks a needle in his arm and turns into the INCREDIBLE HULK peeks me and hits me three times with his M16 and pierces my Lvl 1. Vest and kills me after I hit him twice more. (It only takes 5 seconds to regain your health back to 75%. (If you were lucky enough to find that juicy medkit) Hmmmm. I honestly don't mind the fact that there are armor and helmets in the game, but maybe just make a single tier of them. That would be more fair I think. Better yet, maybe just having no armor or helmet would be better. Let's move on to positioning and map control.Okay, Battle Royale! A game mode which is becoming more popular. You have a no-no zone which every so often closes in from the outer edges of the map. I actually like this feature... well, I like the idea of it. It was implemented very poorly in this game. Here is the reasoning behind my ""OPINION"". This so called, ""circle of death zone"" closes in very slowly after a certain amount of in game time which puts you in a situation. That situation is, you have to go into the ""fair play"" zone or the magical blue gas will choke you out slowly and kill you. Cool, pretty neat concept. It eliminates people from sitting behind a table upstairs in grandma's house for five hours while you look for them. GOT IT. The problem I have with it is, it doesn't do enough damage initially when you get caught in it, and it takes WAY too long in between cycles of getting smaller. I'm not sure if maybe the map is just too large or the circle isn't proportioned correctly. Anyway, back to the first thing I spoke about when you are in the giant airplane at the start. IF you ""rolled the dice"" correctly you may have hit the jackpot and landed inside of the initial circle's ""fair play"" zone. Where then you can manage to find yourself a weapon and sit in grandma's house until the circle shrinks and more dice rolls are required. If you were a poor soul who didn't land in the circle of happiness then... well... enjoy running! You will be running for a majority of the game. There is a 50/50 chance that you get sandwiched between another group running from behind you and the current guy who has been running in front of you. If you are fortunate enough to find a vehicle then you better put the pedal to the metal and get into grandma's house in the happy zone. I mean, sure... you can strategize ways to go about getting into the circle earlier on foot but it will effect the way your looting works. Either way, it's just a great concept that was implemented very poorly in my opinion.OVERALL, this game does have some potential but at it's current state is IN MY OPINION a buggy pile of steaming hot garbage. The main things that I personally think need fixing are as follows:-Hit Detection-Latency-Vehicle Movement/Player Movement-Inventory OptimizationThings that I think are okay/decent so far:-Lobby system-Matchmaking-Some of the menu optionsI would rate this game a solid 3/10 maybe 4/10 on a lucky day...Hope you all enjoyed the review and REMEMBER, SOME PEOPLE ENJOY THIS GAME AND THAT'S OKAY. EVERYONE IS ENTITLED TO THEIR OPINION. IT'S JUST NOT FOR ME!"

I never ran into a ""gamebreaking"" bug or anything like that.The patching announcements from the developers really react to what the community criticised the most and quite a few gameplay mechanics have been changed already (crouching sounds, lobby sounds, pace of circles in endgame) which is a very promising sign.I ♥♥♥♥ing love this game!"

81,293.4,Not Recommended," October 8, 2017",4,EARLY ACCESS REVIEWThere are many many issues with this game and I will go down the list.Pro's:- First game to apply this kind of twist to a Battle Royale that is not a mod of H1Z1...- You can sometimes (Depending on the servers mood at the time) play with friends..Con's:- The developers have decided that if you kill a streamer you are 100% stream sniping and will ban you.. Let streamers handle this themselves like they have had to do for EVERY OTHER GAME.- The developers have decided to go out on a witch hunt against fornit for copying there game... I swear gradeschool all over again.- This game has undoubtedly grossed over $300 MILLION at this point yet there team is not big enough to put out more than 3-5 bug fixes a week. This game is one of the buggest I have played since the beginning of garry's mod... And we are still forced to jump over fences. $300 MILLION and you can't add a vault feature or at least make it so you don't clip into walls/fences?- This game is terribly un-optimized. They can say it is early access all they want but when you have the money to employ enough people to create your own engine there should be no reason why my 1080ti only gets 50-90FPS. I bought a 165hz monitor and a 1080ti to have a advantage with refresh rate and smoothness and it struggles to keep this game above 60fps when you have more than 2-3 people around you.I do NOT recommend buying this game. Wait for a developer that knows what they are doing to publish a worthwhile battle royale. Or go play fornite's new battle royale it is much better that this crap.. Oh and I peg my fps out at 165!!

Optimization is really horrible and you can be cool that your PC is old and needed to improve but it is definitely not. There are many games that are far more sophisticated on the graphics and any other way. And they still work much better. Another thing is the servers. If I ever hated a game for the quality of servers such as ubisoft I take it back. Because PUBG did not win the prize for the best game in 2017, but the game with the worst servers in the world in 2017 (for me). Again we get to our point of joke. The studio owns a huge amount of money but is unable to buy and set up high-quality servers. Everybody knows what I'm talking about and in the game where time matters a delay of 3 seconds at each door or every lag that is caused by the server during the fight is really sad. But right now we'll stop and say the patches go quite often. But what is it for? Let's look at the official release of PUBG the biggest update to version 1.0. We got some FPS and a new map. But the update itself has brought extremely big number of new bugs. Another thing is cheaters. There is no point in disassembling them. They are simply an unacceptable number of them, and I do not see a solution on which bluehole studio works. This is probably everything I wanted to say, and until it's better, this review will not change. In short, it was not the greatest success in 2017 but the biggest failure and the easy way to make money.Update for 13.01.2018- game crushing in important situationsUpdate for 03.02.2018- in game is more and more cheatersUpdate for 25.02.2018- servers still down, cant connect- in some situations people dont have hitboxes--------------"

They locate a popular hack and generate a usage statistic for this specific hack.2. They wait until the hack usage spike falls and equalizes (up to this point, no one was banned).3. Now they'll ban everyone who was using that hack.4. Every cheater will now require a new account (this generates a lot of game sales for them, or in other words... money).5. After generating a lot of game sales by banning those hackers, they'll just wait for the next big hacking tool to emerge.6. Now they'll repeat this very process.There's no good intension behind this, instead of generating more money. If you really wanted to make a game free of cheating, you could include machine learning algorithms and code with some very basic multiplayer coding guidelines (ex. not accepting any data from the client that has nothing to do with required movement or aim position commands, like player health).Funny thing is, this happens with any multiplayer shooter.More cheaters = more banned players = more sold games = more money for the developers.It’s as simple as this and their greed disgusts me."

The developers got the formula right and managed to create the best Battle Royale game in the market right now.The problem is that instead of the devs making an effort to try and fix the game and fix glitches that have been in the game for months, they are focuising to make this game an e-sport which is the dumbest thing I have ever seen being done by a company. No battle royale game can turn into an e-sport.After 1.0 release, updates have significantly slowed down and cheaters are increasing at a much faster rate than early access, to the point where some games have 10+ cheaters and you end up end game with a bunch of hackers fighting each other. This game has so much potential, but with the devs being lazy and not doing any fixes or updates it is becoming stale.My biggest problem with this game is optimization. Low average fps and frame drops ruin the experience for a lot of players and the problem is that these 'anti-cheat' updates are lowering fps not for me only, but a lot of people.Overall, I hope that the devs wake up and notice that these problems that have been around for months are fixed, and the suggestions that have been around for months are implemented into the game. I also hope that their promises, like implementing the map selector are kept."

I understand that it is a pre release but there are so many issues. I lagged way too much during the game which makes it almost un playable. The player creation is very basic. At long range it seems like im playing the original delta force. Just dots moving around. (this is with graphics all the way up) I think there could be more game modes. (may come later on...) The things you get for your in game points is trash. Literally got a shirt with a tie after like 20 games. What is that??On a positvie note... I love the weapons and the mods. That is great! There is a very large weapon selection for a pre launch game. On to match finding... I think they have match finding mastered already. Can find a game in seconds with almost 100 people. That is awesome... I also like how you can drop wherever you want in the area. (really neat and interesting aspect) I think that this game has massive amounts of potential. (please don't ""ARK"" us and come out with BS expansions and pay to play bs...) It seems like there are plenty of people purchasing this game.As a hole I think this game is awesome. I think it was released way to early though... That is why i cant recommend this game as of now. I will keep playing it to see if it changes, and I will modify my review as the game changes.

68,41.5,Not Recommended," September 21, 2017",52,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWWhile I won't sit here and say that this game is flawless, it gets a few things right:- Fun, quick, and entertaining gameplay that leaves you coming back for more- Addicting sense of victory when you kill anyone with little more than a fraction of your own health left.- The ability to get 3 of your friends to form the equivilent of a hunting party to slaughter ALL OF YOUR FOES BEFORE YOU- atm, good cue times.However:- Personally, I feel that the rings close in and don't let you explore as much in fear of being killed by being AoB- *The shotguns tend to feel underwhelming at times, (although, that might just be my poor shooting)*- Streaming and stream-snipers RUINED the community and made the devs act out in quite unorthadox manors- Some lag and performance issues, (although, I am on a gaming laptop as my desktop is currently FUBAR and being repaired)- Sometimes, the servers decide to reset my selection of what server I want to play on, (a small but sometimes irritating bug that leads me to laggy AS server games from here in America).Overall:Devs, seriously, just ask the community here on steam to help you code some things and some might do it FOR FREE. Don't drop the ball like so many other big corps just looking for a cheap buck and poor customer satisfaction.Also, could you maybe tie the ring closure rates to the direct amount of people still left, (so, when there's still about 40 people, its not gonna close in to the final stage unless no one fights for a certain amount of time? Maybe?)Finally, wait for this thing to either get some things fixed or go on sale before purchasing it. It's a good game, but dont buy it until then.*EDIT: So, I managed to get a little bit better and have to retract my prior statement about the SG's in the game.

188,36.3,Not Recommended," October 3, 2017",34,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWUnpolished, bugged, unsatisfying, and clunky. The success hinges entirely on the battle royale genre and that it managed to be better than H1Z1. The game is early access but it's truly so unpolished that it should be in an alpha state. You will not get 60fps stable in this game unless you have a very good computer, and even then it's shaky.The reviews about stream sniping and honking bans are not true. Playerunknown, in his AMA (to the question 'Why do streamers get special treatment?', ""They don't? There is a lot of assumption and rumour flying around and I would be careful as to what you take as truth. As an example, we have never banned anyone for honking near a streamer, despite what others online may say!"". Ignore them, look for evaluations on the actual gameplay. This game should 100% be very positive on steam and despite my disagreement with that rating I do think everyone should try it, the battle royale concept is inherently enjoyable and if you can slog through the bugs and overall awful ""game feel"", you'll likely enjoy it.EDIT: Now that it has been a while and bugs remain unfixed, this game deserves its mixed rating."

Anyway, enough about me; let's get on with the review!Pros: (Stuff I like about it)Fun to play with friendsGreat for strategy lovers (Feels like you are really in the hunger games)Getting a kill is very exitingGreat graphicsVery realistic gameplayLoading time between each game is very shortVeriety of ways to playIf you die in this game, it's like ""eh, no biggy, on to the next game!"" (Doesn't make me mad easily)There are a few more I can't think of right now.Something to understand:Alot of waiting. (Depends on playstyle) If you are not a god at fps games, you will probably end up waiting alot and hiding. Most people want to go to areas with lots of people and just play like it's Call of Duty Deathmatch or something. Unless you are like in the top 1% of ffps players, you will die going into big cities and trying to kill everyone. I bought this game expected more shooting and killing, but going guns blazing into a crowded city is not how you win this game. That's not a bad thing as it turns out. I have had loads of fun playing this game, but in a strategic sense. I found that most of the fun I would get out of the game came once you get to be one of the last 10-15 people alive. That's when it gets really intense. My heart starts pounding and my hands start shaking. But up until that point, you mostly are going to be just going through houses and looting for better gear.TLDR; Beginning of game is a little boring, middle of the game is ok/good(30-20 people left), end of the game(~10 people left) is amazing and where pubg shines.Cons:(Stuff I don't like)Rng can screw you over. Where the circles are is RNG. What weapons you find is RNG. The vehicle spawns are random (mostly) Sometimes you will just get screwed by RNG and can't do anything about it.Vehicle phisics are still kinda broken (Look up pubg fails on youtube, half of the ""fails"" will be vehicle glitchesPlayers can be toxic (squads)Some game mechanics are not explained when you first start playing. e.g pressing b will change firing modes, ctrl 1,2,3,4 changes vehicle seats, right clicking invintory will make it change slots instantly.It's getting late so I'm going to wrap this up:Overall I have really enjoyed this game. I would recommend it to people who enjoy strategy and tactical thinking. It's a great game to play with friends and have a good time. If you like realism in games, this game is for you. The amount of control you have over your character is amazing. If you like the hunger games or ever wanted to feel like you were in it, definetly check this game out. I think that for its price (about half of AAA games like Call of Duty) this game is worth if you like strategy and some fps mixed in. I would give this game a 8/10. Would buy again.Anyway sorry for any mistakes in this review, I have no prior experience writing reviews so this one might be a little, uh, ""meh"" Hope this helped and if you ever want someone to play with, hit me up :D Ok good night and good luck in Player Unkown's Battlegrounds!"

349,0.4,Not Recommended," March 29, 2017",58,"{TL;DR} Buggy game with a bad dev team that is over run by racist, cheating Chinese people on every server because the devs wont add a ping limiter.Seeing as how my last review was a bit outdated, I’m going to update this. I would still like to point out that I wrote this review back around the time when the game first came out and it was still at like a 80% positive score because I knew this would happen. And everyone who left a comment got completely BTFO’d. Now… For the sake of organization and so this doesn’t turn into a book, I’m going to split all the problems into categories.Gameplay : The whole premise of this game is you fly into the map on a plane and you jump out with 100 other players and try to survive. The first problem comes with this game’s engine. It cannot support 100 players on the same map at the same time. It can only support around 75 or so. Meaning for the first section of the game, you will be lagging. Any items you try to pick up you will have to pick up at least 10 times before it goes into your inventory. Also the beginning of the game is awful. It is basically people running around to find a gun, and if you don’t find one fast enough then the enemy will find one and kill you instantly. Players lag and even if you shoot them it wont register a hit because of ping. The game runs awful. Only beefy computers can run this game, even though it isn’t impressive graphics wise, because it is unoptimized and coded awfully. On top of this most people turn off a lot of the settings like foliage or shadows and so on so they can see players from farther away. So they are just useless settings in the end hindering the games performance unless forced to be used or removed. Also a lot of the game is just camping and being prone so no one sees you as you shoot people from far away. That is what 80% of all your deaths are going to be after you get past the unfair beginning section of trying to find a gun.: I don’t normally say racist stuff, but i’m sure everyone can agree that this game is ruined by Chinese people. Due to the dev teams refusal to add a ping limiter every server has a ton of Chinese people. This leads to joining a US server, and hearing people screaming “China numba whon” a bunch, on top of half the players on the US server lagging and being unkillable because they aren’t playing on one of the multiple Asian servers. They are purposefully joining US servers because they know this. This game is also over run by Chinese hackers. And yes, Playerunkown himself said 99% of all cheaters are coming China.Just look at this screenshot from the steam discussion forum.You may think that is the Chinese language tab in the discussions page. Nope. That is general discussions on a daily basis. It’s filled with Chinese spam.: So lets just talk about some unprofessional stuff that this dev team has done. Back around the time the game first came out a friend of mine raised all these issues about the Chinese people to Playerunkown on Twitter and asked him to add a ping limiter. His response was to call him a racist and block him. The dev team also said they would not add loot crates until they left Early Access but added them early anyways. Because why not, they could use more money even though their game is the top selling game all the time. I also have a problem with adding loot crates in a T rated game. Because loot crates are a disgusting form of gambling that devs use to extort money from people with gambling problems and call them “whales”. On top of not liking being called a fish, you shouldn’t be allowed to put what is basically gambling into a game kids are allowed to play. Kids should not be allowed to gamble. The stuff in the loot crates aren’t even that good tbh. Who cares about a yellow shirt when your being shot. Back on topic, the dev team also threatened to sue a game called Fortnite for taking their formula and making it better than their game. On top of the fact that your allowed to do this such as Overwatch copying TF2, PUBG was actually a stolen formula taken from H1Z1. So they are just being hypocrites. The dev team goes as far as to ban people who honk car horns at streamers because “we need to appeal to the people marketing our game” but don’t do anything about the Chinese hacker problem. Also, the fact that you can teamkill in the game and get banned for it is ridiculous. If they don’t like people teamkilling, maybe they should disable it instead of banning people and stealing their money for doing it. These devs are so incompetent that they let their source code leak and now there is a mobile PUBG game in China that uses their code and actually runs better than PUBG in some ways, as seen here.: If you crave this kind of gameplay, go play Fortnite. It is free, more fun, runs better, has a competent dev team, and doesn’t have any of the other problems I listed. It does have loot crates but I can be a bit more lenient since it doesn’t push loot crates in your face after you spend money to buy the game."

621,402.7,Not Recommended," September 17, 2017",21,"I've enjoyed playing PubG with friends, but I'd enjoy playing nearly anything with them. All the devs had to do was mix the king of the hill with survival shooter mechanics in a way that was better than H1Z1, and then they'd be able to take advantage of the Rust and DayZ mechanics being butchered, and the plague of cheaters in CS:GO going unchecked by VAC. PubG won over those playerbases, but I'm still critical of its execution. The input lag was so bad in this game that I spent around £1,000 just to get a gaming rig that let me be competitive in it. Comparing gameplay before and after my upgrade proved to me how bad it was. They should have worked harder optimizing it, and atleast let you see where their servers are located.The loot is extremely inconsistent. You can land at 1 house and find everything you need, while other times you can search several buildings and find no guns at all. So you want to avoid landing near other players in the populated middle of the map when you might not have any guns to fight with, but if you land on the unpopulated outskirts of the map to loot up then you might be forced to spend the whole match running to the other side because of the blue circle of death. It wouldn't be so bad if you could outrun the blue, but it'll zoom past you later into the game, and you'll end up being rushed into flat ground with no cover, offering no room for any strategy. Often you can't even find vehicles when you need them.Instead they've left the game feeling a lot more about luck than skill, which seems odd considering the addition of so many weapon attachments to take advantage of. But you can't test those attachments in singleplayer, so you have to spend match after match trying to find them and test them with and without the attachments on, while other players are drawn to kill you as you're working it out. Even picking up items can be a nightmare. In a situation where seconds matter; you're scrambling to pick something up which might not arrive in your inventory, or if you do pick something up then it might be a cosmetic shirt which was underneath the ammo you're trying to grab. The stereo sound is so bad that it's sometimes fatally misleading when you try to listen to where steps or gunshots are coming from.The inclusion of some basic stats is nice, but they're devalued when you leave a ratio of matches because one of your group had a blackscreen crash, or lost connection, or the game didn't even connect them to the warmup. The stats are devalued completely if they're just going to be wiped. There doesn't seem to be an option to opt-out of heavy fog matches or unpopular maps(when those things are in the game), and with the terrible hit-reg and sluggish aim/firing mechanic, especially with shotguns(yet some players instantly snap to my player and one-shot me), it makes my team want to leave close-range fog ones rather than spend 20 minutes in one to die from a player we only saw when we got pushed by the blue to be right next to them.Ontop of those gripes are a series of smaller gameplay ones that constantly frustrate me. The game lacks hints, the menus are unintuitive and buggy, jumping is bad, vehicles can roll over from the slightest of bumps, taking fall damage from parachute landings(or dying outright), SMGs always being defaulted to semi-automatic, zeroing on sights being defaulted to 100m and can't be set to 0m(including ironsights!?), some windows having wooden bars which can't be penetrated(so you can't fire out), the lack of penetration also making banisters awkward, grenades not following their shown path(leading to potential nade teamkills), and the weapons being so unbalanced that I can get 12 kills with a Mini-14 and never a single kill with an AK. The game itself has several crashes, disconnect errors, and even has errors when trying to send error reports...More issues like trying to grapple with funky keyboard mappings and terrible inventory mechanics, your guns sometimes not deploying when they're shown as selected, often being unable to reload or use meds with no indication as to why(even after checking that I have them), being shot through trees(you can see the arm of the shooter but not their weapon or eyes, but they're still hitting you), no anti-grief mechanic to stop someone trapping you in a tunnel by jamming the entrance with a Jeep lol, glitched smoke grenades(this might have been fixed, but I lost faith in smoke grenades being functional a long time ago), servers going down, the red zone explosions adding nothing to the game except being a frustrating mechanic which will never offer you anything, and cars blowing up like bombs with a wide radius which can instantly kill you.You spend ages trying to loot up, and any little issue can get you killed; undoing all that time spent looting. They call it a strategy game but make it depend so much about luck. If they added more cover to work with, added atleast a tiny bit of consistency to the loot spawns, made the shooting mechanics reliable for every gun, used an effective anti-cheat, got the playermodels+hitboxes+sounds to accurately sync up with where players actually are, and do some optimizing(why would they set default graphics settings to ultra?) then it would be a brilliant game. Until then I'm just trying to have some fun with the firefights and not worrying about winning, because I constantly die due to any of the above issues.I'd give this game 2 stars, but the fact that it won't even let you play sometimes because ""too many login"", and the menu buttons not responding(or automatically clicking themselves), and the game crashing without you even being able to reach the task manager makes this a deeply flawed program and a deeply flawed product. Atleast they have one good map and a fun idea for a game, but it's only a matter of time before someone else makes a more functional version of this, and until then we're all kinda stuck with it. Would they offer us a partial refund for this mess? Never. Would I rate this game above 1 star? Never.ːbronzestarːːSpaceStarːːSpaceStarːːSpaceStarːːSpaceStarː"

Over and over and over.- Obviously the flavor of the month, if you don't mind owning a game that will likely not be finished before the population takes a nosedive.- The gun mechanics are too random.- Far too little happens, for basically zero pay out. You can play whole games and never see another person then BAM you're dead, next round.- The map is pretty boring, it's large but there's only a few places you can go to succesfully gear up.- The devs give FAR too much leeway to streamers, to the point of ignoring the 99% other people who play it.- The vehicles handle... just so badly. It's random and stiff. The tiniest bump can flip anything and things that you should be able to drive through will cause you to crash and damage everyone.- The devs aren't really making the game better, updates don't change much.Biggest con:- The devs care too much about what streamers say. If they don't like the way they get killed, you may be banned. If they think you're honking at them, instead of just honking anyway, you may be banned. Rub a streamer the wrong way, you may be banned.All in all, it's not really a good game. People just got caught up in the hype and refuse to admit it. The game will die, it's going to happen.

At this point - pretty much nothing. And at this point - you shouldn't be trusting _any_ of their promises.Edit 2:Hey, Fortnite Battle Royale is out.

235,127.7,Recommended," July 24, 2017",7,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWPUBG is the type of game where it starts off with not caring too much if you die in the first few minutes (approx 90 players alive), after a little while and some reasonable loot and gear has been found, you would prefer not to die at this point but still not too fussed if you die (approx 60-70 players alive). After the 3rd/4th blue circle,You start to believe that you can achieve the impossible...you could possibly win...you'll taste the sweet fruits of victory...(10 players remaining)...you've made it to top 10....but you still want more....no more mistakes or joking around now...you're close....(last 2 players)...you believe in this...you can win!

But I am starting to loose interest and am looking for another game to play because of the amount of cheating in the game. The desync is a real problem too, when someone has high ping they shoot and kill you before you even see them on screen. In every other game it is just the opposite where the guy with the lowest ping has an advantage which encourages people to play on local servers. Which brings me to my 3rd issue with the game. When I play 4 hours straight and can not get a team mate who speaks the same language as me it starts to feel very isolating. I mostly play online games for the social aspect of it and not being able to communicate with my team mates is not a good experience."

I thought the same things and haven't enjoyed a FPS in years, probably since MW2. This game is all I play now.

Yes now i have more than 2 hours playtime and i can't refund it anymore. The price of this game worth 16 meals in Viet Nam, so it not very cheat. Now what i can do is write a review to hope somebody like me not buy this game !!The Good:1. Non-toxic community, because the language barrier and no teamplay.The Bad:1. The most importance thing in multiplayer game is internet connection. I'm playing with 30 ping and that means really good. But no, i play with spike, lag, and desync issues. So i only can shoot anybody if they're standing still. If not, i just hope RNGJesus blessing.2. The FPS in this game is really bad. My PC spec is not bad though. GTX 970, core i5, 16GB of RAM, ... I can play GTA, Witcher 3 with really high setting. But in this game, even lowest setting, FPS still go from 12-90 FPS constantly, especially in the close range gun fight.3. The gameplay is boring with few strategy and a lot of luck. Who loot the best gear and have a centered spot = win. Or you just need a shotgun, hiding somewhere in the center and wait them killing eachother then kill the last guy = win.4. The devs just swimming in the money pool and keep release new map, new cosmetic item for selling and attract new player to get more money.

They put in game advertisements for a VPN on the chinese client, and made it so they can only connect to a game they already own by paying monthly for a VPN they get a cut of the profit from.

Don't get the game, they don't deserve a dime of your cash and they don't care at all about what you want for or from the game after you buy.||NEW ADDITION||Newest patch, they added nothing decent, game runs even worse. The way people play is basically just to hide and shoot you in the back as you come into the circle in front of them or shoot you in the face as you try to come into the circle. I landed in Sant Martin on the garbage Map Miramar, looted the whole city and found no one. Went through two circles only seeing people drive past on the road. Same thing for the next few circles, walk into like the sixth, a guy just camping a house sprays me down as I take cover behind the only thing I can find, a skinny wimpy tree. It's not that I'm salty I died to that guy, it's that it took damn near 20 mins just to get to get someone to shoot at me. Every match is running or driving and hiding. Both the way people play, and the stupid damage of the circle, means there's not really a fun or reliable way to play competitively unless you enjoy camping for a really long time and getting lucky with circle placement. So many of my friends have moved onto Fortnite and it's not hard to see why. Hell, even streamers like Shroud are starting to hate PUBG, and moving onto Fortnite. I'm done with this garbage game, maybe if I could at least get decent FPS that didn't get screwed over every patch, maybe. Before the most recent crates patch and such, which by the way, look absolutely horrendous and down right boring, I could hold a consistent 65 FPS by doing a bunch of stuff with my settings that I didn't figure out until I cleared my settings that helped me with the patch before that. I could run it up at around at least medium quality on most everything, and get consistent 65 FPS for a few games before my PC wanted a break. Now I'm running everything on low again and getting what is says is 39 frames, but in reality is my FPS detection not knowing what to tell me because it keeps frame skipping so much it doesn't know what it's looking at.♥♥♥♥♥♥game, don't invest in trash.

It will simply redirect you to the site with ˝possible˝solutions, which might end up breaking your computer even more (I aint computer genious).Game developers constantly look on the lag issues, which are also present for me, but dont look at the crashes whatsoever. Each patch makes game crash more often, therefore you have to fix it yourself while the fix will last to the next patch only.Game takes up a whopping 44% of total GPU memory IN THE STARTING MENU ONLY! I played several games with demanding graphics without problems (BF 1 for example), so I dont know how this game with poor to average graphics can even dare to take up so much space.And the price? Not worth the money. I would give it maximum 10 Euros for the state the game is in currently: bugy, glitchy and there are no real benefits for purchasing the early access.I rate it 2.7/10, and flexible gameplay saves it from being even lower.EDIT FOR FULL RELEASE:Full release of the game was introduced with less overall lag issues, but introduced rubberbanding from some reason, which in some cases makes gameplay unbearable.New map is good, but really sided to the players with snipers, as the map has large open areas where an unscoped weapon can do nothing.Vaulting mechanics are nice, but took very long to implement from some reason.New weapons are average. Sawed off is nice, but Rhino revolver is really poorly implemented and unecessary. From the new weapons only the AUG has some level of modifications available, while other guns have only sights and some nothing.New vehicle sounds are very nice, but the Mini bus is close to useless.Therefore I give it in the current state: 3.1/10It was a slightly overhyped patch, still wouldnt pay more than 10 Euros for it."

Don't get me wrong, I love this game, it's so damn fun, though the RNG can be really tilting. What gets me is that the creators of the game are absolute scumbags. They put in game advertisements for a VPN on the chinese client, and made it so they can only connect to a game they already own by paying monthly for a VPN they get a cut of the profit from. Because of this, asian players have been flooding North American and EU servers with scripts like crazy, because Bluehole is a bunch of greedy♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ The game is fun, fantastic even, but the player base is cancer and is reacting to an even more cancerous developer group. I honestly don't know what I can say, they really should fix the♥♥♥♥♥♥they made with China, it'd help us all out, but they won't, because they're greedy. Don't get the game, they don't deserve a dime of your cash and they don't care at all about what you want for or from the game after you buy.||NEW ADDITION||Newest patch, they added nothing decent, game runs even worse. The way people play is basically just to hide and shoot you in the back as you come into the circle in front of them or shoot you in the face as you try to come into the circle. I landed in Sant Martin on the garbage Map Miramar, looted the whole city and found no one. Went through two circles only seeing people drive past on the road. Same thing for the next few circles, walk into like the sixth, a guy just camping a house sprays me down as I take cover behind the only thing I can find, a skinny wimpy tree. It's not that I'm salty I died to that guy, it's that it took damn near 20 mins just to get to get someone to shoot at me. Every match is running or driving and hiding. Both the way people play, and the stupid damage of the circle, means there's not really a fun or reliable way to play competitively unless you enjoy camping for a really long time and getting lucky with circle placement. So many of my friends have moved onto Fortnite and it's not hard to see why. Hell, even streamers like Shroud are starting to hate PUBG, and moving onto Fortnite. I'm done with this garbage game, maybe if I could at least get decent FPS that didn't get screwed over every patch, maybe. Before the most recent crates patch and such, which by the way, look absolutely horrendous and down right boring, I could hold a consistent 65 FPS by doing a bunch of stuff with my settings that I didn't figure out until I cleared my settings that helped me with the patch before that. I could run it up at around at least medium quality on most everything, and get consistent 65 FPS for a few games before my PC wanted a break. Now I'm running everything on low again and getting what is says is 39 frames, but in reality is my FPS detection not knowing what to tell me because it keeps frame skipping so much it doesn't know what it's looking at.♥♥♥♥♥♥game, don't invest in trash. Oh, and this doesn't even mention the hackers, racism, and annoying little kids who mic spam in lobby and ruin and sense of interaction you could get in the lobby and plane. Well, I guess now it sort of does."

They said there would be no micro-transactions during Early Acess and guess what, they just released micro-transactions while still in early access. They're also giving streamers special treatment, banning people they (streamers) think that are stream-sniping. If you buy this game bear in mind you could get banned simply for shooting some random kid that's live-streaming it."
146,486.7,Not Recommended," December 20, 2017",7,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWThis is the most popular PC game of 2017.I understand it. The game can be very, very addicting and awesome. There are stituations that can be challenging and rewarding if you survive, and solo/duo/squad modes each have their own special moments.This is the first battle royal game I have ever played. And at first I rly liked it. But the reason I give this a thumbs down is:The game is not ready. There are a lot of issues with this game but two of them are the major things that bug me:1. People move like robots. There is so much lag, desync and unpretended movement, that the close combat is just impossible. You have to have perfect internet connection if you want to survive the opening lags ( the game lags for a pretty long time after the jump from plane)2. It doesnt look good. You have to have minimum settings to have at least 40 fps. And even if you put the best settings on and enjoy the 15 fps, the game still doesnt look that great. I have a pretty good PC and yet this is the only game where I rly need to lower graphics settings.I am sad that this is ""the game"" of the year. I quess they are trying to launch it on december so they can try to get the awards. But it doesnt deserve it. Even if Twitch is full of popular streamers playing this garbage. We can only hope that some day us gamers learn that these early access games need to be left alone, to rot or to be finished patiently and to be well made and well tested. Not just for easy money."
142,20.8,Not Recommended," July 13, 2017",7,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWThis is an early access game. An incomplete game but with potential. Make your purchasing decision with this in mind.Gameplay-wise, PUBG is a solid game with mechanics that keep players on the edge of their seats as they try to survive the every man (or squad) for themself situation. Weapons don't have that arcadey feel often found in other shooters - here in PUBG bullets are subject to travel time and even dropoff. Crouching and/or holding your breath improves your aim. If an enemy is reloading they can be interrupted by meleeing them, etc. Thought and caution must be taken as whoever notices the other in a firefight usually wins. A layer of strategy exists in how to achieve this. Clearly a lot of thought has been put into the gameplay side of things and it makes for an exciting experience.Despite good gameplay, I don't recommend PUBG to people due to lots of bugs. The devs know many bugs and are probably working their derierres off, with weekly updates to the game. The game runs fine on my rig so far with sometime stuttering. One of my mates however finds the game riddled with bugs which make PUBG unplayable, even on his good-spec, freshly Windows-nuked rig. Sometimes when updates arrive, one aspect of the game is fixed while breaking another. Another bug is random item spawns clipping through walls.Not all planned mechanics in the game have been implemented as of writing. The lack of vaulting to get over certain obstacles is a big annoyance to me. It's especially bad having to run 100m around concrete fences to get to your destination because you can't vault or jump that belly-height wall in front of you.Optimisation so far isn't that great in PUBG and when it causes you to lose firefights, depending on your personality, you might feel like tearing your hair out.If you choose to buy this game, be wary of bugs, and if the game is unplayable... that's what the 2-hour Early Access refund policy of Steam is for.EDIT Nov 2017: To add to the reasons to be cautious, PUBG now has loot boxes for cosmetic items and a tendency to focus on streamers, at the expense of the general game population."

200,1.2,Not Recommended," September 7, 2017",7,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWI recommend you watch ""Indie Game: The Movie"", which chronicles the developers of Super Meat Boy and Fez spending years of their lives perfectly crafting, in painstaking detail, these polished, beautiful, perfectly calibrated experiences which are a whole expression of their creative vision. These guys grind themselves to the bone, with seemingly no version of what they're building being quite good enough, and there's one particularly tense scene where Phil Fish finds a bug which crashes Fez the day he's about to demo it at PAX. You can see the way it wounds him somewhere deep inside of him. The results speak for themselves; Fez is maybe the prettiest game ever made, and Super Meat Boy is about as perfect an example of game design there is, with platforming that controls better than Super Mario.I wonder how these guys feel when they compare the relatively modest success of their games with the runaway sales of this buggy, laggy, half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥glorified asset flip."

42,674.1,Not Recommended," November 24, 2017",7,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEWAfter 379 hours of playing this game I'm writing my first Steam review ever. It is because I want to tell people that I don't recommend this game...at all. The only good thing about this game is the principle of it, the Battle Royale. It's so much fun to be placed on an Island with 99 other players and fight over the first place. It's so intense and no other game I have played (and I played a LOT) has ever offered me this experience. But that's it. PUBG looks bad, it sounds bad (with a few exceptions) and it plays as bad as no other game in my 20 years history of gaming. The real problem is the servers which makes this game next to unplayable. They said they would improve the servers but they did nothing. It didn't change ONE BIT since May 2017 and being close to release of version 1.0 it's save to say that there will not be any improvements.I can't even begin to describe the tons of times I died because of lag, desync and co.. Sometimes you don't even know how you got killed at first until your mate tells you what happened because he observed it...and you can't believe it because you experienced it totally different.By the time a bigger developer creates one of those Battle Royale games with working servers, this game is gonna die faster than you can say ""♥♥♥♥ THIS♥♥♥♥♥♥"".By the state of this game it would be plain stupid to buy it. Yes, I bought it too...call my naiv because I believed in Bluehole because they had soooooo many sales and thus $$$$$$. But now I have to admit that I was wrong and I just want to warn people that think that ""maybe they should give it a try"". Don't! Watch streams and wait. Until these server issues remain, don't buy this piece of code-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t!"
