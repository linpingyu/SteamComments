You race to the tree, and begin to open a beautiful present, adorned with festive colors and a wrapping scheme that is both dauntingly complex yet also simple in its execution. You turn to your mother, father, and two siblings and smile; for you know that your adventure into opening your gift is about to begin. You go to open your unwrapped box, and BWONG.. A horn bellows, deafening you. Out of the box pops a small, dwarf-like figure, wielding a multicultural bat festooned with Ecuadorian and Peruvian patterns, and of Russian construction. ""THANKS FOR STANDING STILL, GANKER,"" he shrieks, as he wallops young brother Timmy in the teeth. Your mother tuts and scolds him, for being out of position. The dwarf darts under the tree, looking for a hole in the wall to continue his pursuit of rat-DOTA. ""Gank him,♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥!"" your father roars, as he sits on the couch lazily and watches. You crawl, desperate for your gift of victory over the rat, under the tree, and he continues to elude you. Suddenly, with a flourish, he produces a lighter, and proceeds to methodically burn down your house while muttering ""GG 2 EZ"", and your family sits in the living room muttering ""garbage team"" and ""reported"". Your family home burns down around them, and only you escape the engulfing flames, accompanied by the chortles of the dwarf. Downtrodden but not easily bested, you begin your walk down the street to your friend's house, in the hopes that by having Christmas at their house, you might be able to somehow catch the multicultural dwarf on the second try.10/10 Best fun and Peruvian simulator."

Within a few days, however, you'll feel an urge to play it. You're going to watch videos of pro people teaching you how to play, and you're going to think that now you're really good.You're wrong.Over time, however, things will get better, and you'll actually start winning. Then, you start losing again, but this time it's not your fault; it's your teams fault. Always remember that NOTHING is EVER your fault. Your dumbass anti-mage was complaining that you were stealing his farm, but it's your farm dammit! Then pudge is getting butthurt about losing lane because he never had a flying courier, when the real reason he lost is because he didn't give you unit control when you are clearly a better pudge! Meanwhile the enemy team is getting fed because your teamates never backed you up when you blitzkrieged in 1v5, and they even have the nerve to question your methods! Then you notice that your dumbass anti-mage is in the jungle farming because ""he couldn't farm in lane."" You know, however, that he is just a noob.Eventually the enemy is pushing your tier 3s, and the game is obviously over. This is the time when you give up and sit in base. Ignore the fact that your team has won the last two teamfights and you are starting to catch up, it's better if you just quit now. While you're waiting in base, make sure that the enemy team knows that you are not at fault in your loss. Make sure you type in all-chat ""team noob"" followed up by ""report anti-mage."" If they ask why you want them to report him, ignore them, if your team has the bodacity to try and defend themseves, repeatedly say phrases such as ""lol ur so bad"" and ""ur just mad cuz you cant play."" You could also take the alternative route and say things like ""им незрелые восьмилетний"" and ""я должен убить себя.""Yea, the game and communtiy can be a♥♥♥♥♥♥sometimes, but it's also a super fun game that requires fast paced decision making as well as strategical analysis. Plus, it unifies gamers and conservatives by creating one common hatred: Russians.All in all, this game is 90% getting♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and 10% feeling like you're on top of the world, but that 10% makes you feel sooooo good that it keeps pulling you back."

Unlike LoL or HoN which require you to use a rotating hero list until you buy your own with real money or accumulate enough in-game currency to buy a single hero, DOTA 2 immediately gives you access to its entire library of heroes, for free.

I've been playing Dota 2 for around 10 years since it was DotA, the Warcraft III custom map and I'll tell you right now there's still a lot of room for personal improvement. This game boils down to far more than individual skill, tactics, and teamwork/cooperation. The author of ""Three Lane Highway"" (see pcgamer.com) has called Dota an ""isometric wizard-em up"" game, and I think it's fitting. There are so many aspects to this game, so many factors that control the outcome that if you try and sit down and list them all it'll take you a couple hours. And you'll still miss some. I have played pretty much every single ""Multi-player Online Battle Arena"" on the market, and no matter how interesting they are or what different elements they try to bring to the gameplay, I always end up coming back to Dota.If you want to seriously challenge yourself, and you have the will and motivation to work towards a lofty goal that many are unable to reach, this is the game for you."

You could even just play other games, you know, those ones sitting in your backlog, pushed aside by DotA 2.But you won't.You will always return to this game. The maximum you will learn from playing this game is how to insult others in various languages (mostly these languages will consist of Russian and Peruvian.). This game will become as much a part of your life as eating or blinking. Half the time you will not even remember having played DotA 2 on a certain day. It just becomes natural to you.If you start playing this game, you become addicted.You will also spend obscene amounts of money on cosmetics. A quick chest purchase here, a few random items on the market there, and boom. Like me you'll have spent far too much on a game which needs no money spent on it. If you start DotA 2, not only will you be subjecting yourself to a motivation-destroying hobby, but also subjecting yourself to a wallet emptying one too.tl;dr This game will take away your time, money and patience for others.

Dota 2 is definitely one of the best games of this generation, and I'm certain it will remain as popular and as influnencal for many years to come.Graphics: 8.5/10Very pretty, the art direction in DotA 2 is one of the best. The source engine ensures you can run it on anything more powerful than a toaster, and have it look great too. Cosmetics look great, and fit perfectly, with some exceptions,(I'm looking at you Alpine Ursa) but many stay true to the heros artstyle.Sound: 9.5/10All heros have a multitude of voice lines,and some even respond to one another (e.g Tidehunters hatred for Kunnka). If you find the default anouncer not too flash, theres a huge variety of optional packs, from the smoth talking Narrator from bastion, to the harsh condescending tone of Pyrion Flax.Gameplay: 10/10The big one. Theres a reason DotA Allstars got so popular, not just from the incredible passsion from the community, or the dedication of IceFrog and co., but from the incredible gameplay that spawned one of gamings most popular genres. From perfectly co-ordinating a fountain hook, to getting stuck on top of a cliff accidentally as Storm Spirit, no other genre rivals DotA 2 outstanding strategic gameplay and near-vertical learning curve. At the time of writing, I have 7,469 hours played and I've only just scratched the surface in the combos, stratagy and 107 availble heros to use, it takes year of hard work, dedication and passion to become truly great at the strategical masterpeice that is Dota 2.- beardATTACK @ fren"

I really should have thought about spending money on a free game but to hell with it I say. Mechanics are well designed, what makes a hero OP is the player behind it and the team that surrounds it. This is a team game people, so team work is a must (unless you are solo queuing, then you have to carry your garbage of a team but it can be the other way around). Monster gamers are real.Dota 2 has taught me a lot of things, you can only be good at something if you focus on it, learn from mistakes, be aware of your surroundings, trust your instinct, use common sense, trusting on your team to always have your back, believing in your capabilities, always try to be better than you were yesterday, and that..THE COMEBACKS ARE REAL!!!This game bought me and my friends together for lan parties and strengthen our bonds. A mere game that brings people together, not just friends but complete strangers too. Dota 2 is a game that will never be forgotten.All in all, I recommend this game to everyone who wants to experience pain, suffering, and torment because at the end, you will come to a sudden realization that things are always bound to get better.P.S.

There are two bases, each on opposing corners of the map, and one for each team. The objective is to destroy the opposing team's base. Three roads, or lanes, connect the bases. Low-level units automatically and periodically spawn from each base in groups, and these soldiers travel down the three paths between the bases. As a result, there is always a battle going on in the trio of lanes.In addition, each team has three defensive towers in each lane on their side of the map, totaling nine towers per team. These structures deliver powerful attacks against enemy soldiers and players, but they can be destroyed through significant effort. Because of this, fights tend to center on the towers.All of this happens automatically. Unlike in typical RTS games, you don't have to collect resources, build structures, or train units. You only control your hero, which can level up and acquire a range of upgradeable powers. However, its role might best be described as support for the A.I. soldier units. Players help control the battlefronts and destroy enemy towers in the lanes. The idea is to to open your opponent's base up to a direct attack by the A.I. and hero once the towers in a lane are gone. There are five players per team, which of course doesn't divide into the three lanes equally. When a player dies, he respawns at the team's base after a penalty period.----------------------------------------Pro&Con---------------------------------------------PROS1, All At Your Fingertips – players have access to ALL of the game's heroes from the start. No need to unlock or purchase heroes. ( poor LOL)2, Snowball Easily – dying results in a loss of gold, can magnify the effects of snowballing(Buyback system can make sure you don't lose a game with just one mistake).3, Huge Variety of Cosmetics and Skins – players can customize individual parts of their heroes from both valve and community. (weapons, armor, helmets, etc.).4, Custom Game Support – players can build their own custom games within Dota 2 (Pudge Wars, Tower defenses, Racing, Battleships, and more!)5, Skill-Based and Competitive – similar to LoL, Dota 2 is heavily reliant on a player's skill, is very competitive, and has a large e-Sports scene.CONS:1 , Dota directly affects on your life (social life)2 , Time consuming( Avg about 45 min per game + additional queuing time(about 3-10 mins depends on your region))3 , Hard for newbies ( up to 500 hrs bot practices at least ---usually about 800 hrs)4 , hbp due to rage (you may having 3 r e t a r d s and peru feeder/feeders on your side of team)---------------------------------------ADDITIONS---------------------------------------------Don't spend too much money on treasures. All the rare items can be purchased through community market if you feel like you are not gonna get any of rare sets."

It is a real rewarding piece with a beautiful community that is keen on helping you improve and unleash your hidden potential. Even though I've achieved the highest Badge possible in the game (which is also a great and original idea to somewhat categorize players), I am still reminded day-by-day that I'm pretty new to the game and I should focus on polishing my skills, which is a huge help since I am somewhat a maximalist.The Dev Team is amazing and fast to reply in cases of bugs, broken things throughout the game that would otherwise alter the potential outcome of important Ranked Matches. I would highly recommend it to people thinking about taking up a semester abroad or such since it does help You enourmously when it comes to foreign languages.After just 2 years I was fluent in Russian and Spanish even though I have never taken a class before and this allowed me to travel to St Petersburg and Barcelona taking my language skills to the next level. It's easy to make friends, people have no prejudice when it comes to your Badge, Divine (highest rank in the system) players play with Heralds (lowest rank in the system) and enjoy spending some free time with their fellow bratushki.I would also like to thank Valve for the amazing support towards amateur and semi-professional teams, the sponsoring of various national tournaments all over the globe and the ability to connect with each other in real life through this amazing franchise.- The game rewards You trying really hard to win games and works on pushing you even further. The higher your impact in games, the lower impact people it will match with you, resulting in you having to push even harder. Amazing!- Understand people from all over the globe through simple words, hieroglyphs, and ancient text. Being able to acquire and share information in a new and intuitive way.- Some people take the role of the good soldier and some that of the leader. With Power however comes Great Responsibility. You are ready to make calls and lead your team towards victory? Keep in mind that you will also be accounted for the consequences of a miscall. But in the end you will become more daring and even better at leading with example!- The more you play the more advanced you become and analysis, prediction and understanding of movement and thoughts of people you have never met before. Paired with your glorious Communication Skills you will be able to share and respond to any situation. You will effectively be able to see the future as it is!- While most games are circa 30 minutes long, in some games you spend a wonderful 1,5 hrs time together with 9 other nice people who you learn to know during this experience. The longer the game lasts however, the harder it becomes since any small mistake you make can be the end of the struggle. You acquire the ability called Laser Focus: eyes on the goal, maximum efficiency, 0 error factor. High level players have iron nerves!- As human beings we must understand that sometimes we win and sometimes we learn. After lost games we still are eager to learn from our mistakes, commend the people that accounted for the win on the opposing team and pat the weaker players on the back. Standing up after a failure is a key factor in creating something new, in evolving. DotA is a major enhancement in this area.Give it a try, enjoy your time and who knows we might meet in game! ;)Cheers,"

Of course you will not be ''pro'' in your first matches. To be good you need a lot of training. If you played LoL and you have 30 lvl its sure you know the ""basics"". In this game the most important thing is the ""Last Hitting"" at the start, because if you have more gold and XP than your enemy, you own the game. The game may be boring, but if you have friends it won't be. I think the boring part is the first 13 lvl because you can't play some gamemodes before that. If you are new here you need to complete the training! If you are totally new here completing the training will get you a Sniper set. No the setts doesn't give you any bonus, just the enemy can see how rich you are. These decorative items have degree: Common, Uncommon, Rare, Mythical, Immortal, Old and Arcane. This items can be Normal, Auspicious, Heroic, Cursed and Unusual. So these were the decorative items lets talk about the in-game items! You start with 625 gold each hero have their own item build. I recommend you the Healing Slave, Tango and clarity items, this items will fill your HP or your mana. If you are new or never played that hero before i recommend you the guides (Up left the book icon). I recommend you the GreyShark(RU/UA) builds or Purge(ENG) builds.Thank you for reading this review. #P3D0'#Hungarian#DotA2fan"

This game is not for the faint hearted. You will be abused, beaten, broken, griefed, tormented and hated on the entire time, and yet you can't stop playing because of the high you get when you win an 80 minute comeback game against mega creeps and divine rapiers. This must be how drug addicts feel.Dota 2 takes sane men and turns them into vile despicable human beings and you have to play with and against such people on a regular basis. To win you must now become captain of the SS dumbf**k and somehow try to convince your teammates fighting the enemy team and not their own is in their best interest.It's also got he highest concentration of Dunning–Kruger patients in the entire online gamming community. Valve's terrible low priority system doesn't help.Assuming you're a masochist and you aren't deterred by all of the above, you get to experience probably the best free online multiplayer game on the planet. With dota 2 you get...... 115 heroes, 100+ items,hundreds of 5 hero strategies, tens of thousands of lane matchups and infinite replayability. You can and will spend years just learning about each of them. Dota 2 has a thriving pro scene with the international giving out the biggest prize pools in all of esports and many regular sports. New patches and compendiums keep the gameplay fresh for most of the year. The latest international had a 95.5% pick rate of heroes which is a testament to how well the game is balanced.And if you're a gambling man, dota 2 is just the game for you. Introducing more lootboxes than any other game you've ever seen! Want literally any cosmetic in the game? Well there is a lootbox with your name on it waiting to be opened gabeN.Just remember no matter how good you get at dota, you're never good enough....and you'll end up chasing the mirage of a high mmr and good players while trodding though mud and $h1t and you never realize it's not real till you're in too deep."

Never did, but I always loved to play as the Paladin in Warcraft 3 (Reign of Chaos and The Frozen Throne) in battle.net solo ladder matches. If you played ladder in that game, you know that nobody selects the Paladin as their main or even secondary hero. I obviously lost a lot, but I had fun. Then the custom maps (5 corridors, footmen rush, dota, etc) came out where I could play as a single hero. I enjoyed those maps a lot since I could victoriously play as the Paladin. So when Dota 2 came out and it had the Paladin in it, I was all in!In all my hours played in Dota 2 I only played as Omniknight. I already stopped playing this game since it was time to move on, but I couldn't just leave my Paladin without saying goodbye so I created my Omniknight guide where I just opened my soul and let the juices flow. That Dota 2 Steam guide is now on page 1 (out of 4000 pages) of ""Top Rated All Time""."

91,"1,696.3",Not Recommended," January 23, 2014",520,"I originally played Dota when it was merely a UMS on WC3, so take this review for what it's worth.Dota 2 is an addictive experience; however, this game also draws a player base from the bottom of society. If that statement is an insufficient description of the game, continue reading.This game is not for the casual gamer, this game is for those who have the capability to log in hundreds of hours into a game.If you play this game, I can attest that there will be times you love it and times you just want to break your monitor with your keyboard. I have a few hundred hours into the game and no matter how long you play, no matter what you do, you will encounter someone who will complain about something you're doing poorly or not doing correctly and it may ruin the gameplay for you. I can only recommend this game if you have thick skin or you have friends to play with.So here are what I consider the pros and cons of the game:Pros-This is a very intricate strategy based game that relies heavily on teamwork and timing.-Free to play with optional cosmetic costs.-Gameplay always varies due to each individual hero selection. This, in effect, increases replayability tremendously.-Wonderful voice actors with interesting dialogue choices by the developer.-Winning matches in this game often triggers the release of dopamine in the reward center in your brain creating the desire to play more. This in effect causes players to really want to win and may be the trigger of many cons of the game.Cons-This game has a steep learning curve, believe me, there is way more to this game than you might think at first glance. Unlike hero customization in League of legends, not all heroes are created equal and not all ward placements are either. It can be a little intimidating to think that your team is already at a disadvantage from the hero selection, but thus is DOTA.-Secondary to the steep learning curve, games tend to be won or lost by the actions of an individual on either team. This can be ameliorated by steam implementing some sort of ""fundamentals of gameplay"" video instead of the current lackadaisical tutorial they have. Suffice to say, many new players do not understand that every time their hero is killed by the opposing team, the player loses gold and the other team gains gold. This doubles the impact that each individual has for gameplay.-Unlike other video game developers, Steam does not region lock. This brings about an unforeseen consequence where individuals from any country can join any server despite having a language preference. You can imagine how difficult it is to create a coordinated cohesive team push when there's a Russian only speaker, Spanish only speaker and a Portuguese only speaker on the US WEST server.-Blame is a word that is thrown around in this game like the word inequality is thrown around in America. Unfortunately, this is by far the worst aspect of the game. The game community has very little to no interaction prior to gameplay or thereafter and there is no review conversation on what an individual can do to improve in the future. More often than not, an individual will oversimplify the ongoing team loss to 1 action by 1 individual because of time constraints and heated emotions.-There is no team forfeit vote option in game and often you are sitting there for 10-20 minutes as the other team wastes your time despite securing a victory much earlier.This review is from personal experience and your gameplay may vary. Of course, if you do meet someone ingame who is a decent person, be sure to commend them at the end of the match for their ingame courtesy.Final Rating:-Game 9/10-Game community 3/10"

1,710.9,Recommended," January 19, 2014",111,"Dota 2 ranks among few titles that can be classified as truly free-to-play. While many other titles label themselves with this distinction, there are often convenience purchases or some form of power available for real money transactions. While Dota 2 has an extensive cash shop, all offerings are completely cosmetic. HUD options, voice packs and character costumes form the basis of a store lacking even an iota of power or convenience for purchase. All gameplay elements are absolutely free and do not require collection or usage of any kind of in-game currency.Once a player has determined that they’re ready to commit to a steep learning curve and potential negative interactions with teammates (Again, learn with friends to reduce this aspect), Dota 2 is incredibly enjoyable and possibly one of the best multiplayer games ever made. Every match is different, and watching perfect team fight execution is gaming art. Players have access to a huge range of hero styles and the interactions between teammates and foes are incredibly diverse. It’s twenty to forty-five minutes of gladiatorial bliss, the end result carefully orchestrated from the first enemy tap to the final crushing blow.Dota 2 can be experienced and enjoyed at multiple levels of engagement, and it’s a title that rewards users for a deep dive. Heavy investment, heavy reward. The barrier to entry isn’t quite as bad as it was years ago, but it would be disingenuous to say that the game doesn’t have a colossal learning curve. As a free-to-play title readily available on Steam, it offers players a frictionless doorway – but the challenge may be keeping new players interested and willing to commit to the epic journey that is learning, playing, and enjoying Dota 2.The game is in a strong place right now. It’s rewarding and sociable like few other games, and despite its vast popularity it still feels like a secret waiting to be discovered. The next few months will be crucial: it’s currently the best expression of Valve’s progressive attitude towards players, and if it can continue on that track it describes a future for online gaming that is far more hopeful than the one we’re used to.Just remember to spend your starting cash, and make sure someone buys the courier. Oh, and when Riki starts showing up in your games, just get some Sentry Wards down and don't run away. Also, you always want a Bottle when in mid-lane, and runes spawn at 0:00 and again every two minutes. Practice last-hitting before you go online. And if you're jungling, memorise where the low-level Creeps are.Actually, you know what? Forget all that. Just have fun.4 out of 5"

Your team will let you down constantly, the enemy team will consistently pick the heroes you hate playing against the most, you will never get the hat drops you want, and your own mind and body will frequently betray you and make you contend with the fact that you are not nearly as good as you think you are (or, more likely, force you to live in a fantasy dream world where you are as good as you think you are and just blame your teammates some more). It'll turn you into a monster and destroy your life. It'll murder your loved ones and feed them to you.But you'll play it anyway. You'll ragequit and uninstall and stare at your library of games as the creeping realization sweeps over you that you not playing Dota 2 will not effect the universe in even the smallest way, will have no conceivable effect on anything. You will be filled with a sudden dread that nothing you do matters and life has no meaning. Basically the same feeling you get when you play Dota 2. And Dota 2 will be your only distraction from this dessicated husk of a life. So the next day you'll find yourself drawn back into it like a moth to a flame, staving off the moment when you'll have to face your demons for as long as you can. You will probably die alone some day and nobody will remember how high your MMR was or your sunstrike accuracy.So what are you waiting for, you worthless peons?! Get out there and dance! DANCE FOR THE PUPPETMASTER GABE! GO EARN YOUR HATS, YOU CRAVEN MONGRELS!0/10 would not recommend to anyone but can't stop playing and won't be able to stop you either."
141,"3,481.1",Not Recommended," November 14, 2014",3,"Alright, listen up. Instead of being sarcastic and writing a funny review that jabs at russians, I'm going to tell you how Dota 2 really is at it's core.In a nutshell Dota 2 is a great game, but a terrible experience at the same time. You want to keep going back to it, but you also hate to go back. Why? One word: community. Dota 2's community is for the most part rude and hateful (and undeniably filled with russians who refuse to speak any other language than that of their own), sapping the joy out of this otherwise polished and addicting MOBA. It's unfriendly to beginners and the basic mindset is to belittle anyone who makes a mistake. Make one wrong move and you are called a noob right away... at the best of times. Often it's much worse and I would prefer not to go into the details. Sometimes you get a crapstorm of hate and blame even if you haven't actually done anything wrong. Occasionally, though, you come across friendly players, and when that happens, the game is a pure joy to play. However, since the game is 5v5, coming across four nice players at the same time (if you're solo queueing) is a rarity.Why then have I played the game for over 2000 hours? The sensation of winning. Your determination to keep playing, despite of the discouraging community, is fueled by the fantastic sensation of a glorious victory. That sweet moment when you see the enemy Ancient blow up and look back on the match, remembering all the plays and teamwork that lead you to victory is ever so gratifying. But even a victory can come with a grain of salt. Many times you have rude teammates that rage in the chat even when your team is winning. There is a mute option, but that doesn't stop the bad manners that extend outside the chat. People can intentionally feed the enemy team, ignore their own team, teamkill with some abilities and just generally be a bad player. It's really frustrating and the worst part is it happens all the time.Going ranked doesn't really solve the problem either, at least not completely. Ranked matchmaking is a more serious type of mode in Dota 2 that ranks you based on how well you do and finds opponents of equal skill. It feels much more professional and ""tryhardish."" Although you meet nice players more often, nothing stops the rude players from jumping over the fence and playing ranked aswell. Having played some matches in ranked, I can say the mode isn't ""hate free."" I had some of the worst matches in regards to teammates in that mode. Another problem with ranked is that, like I said, it's more ""tryhard."" Many just want to play the game casually and not have to worry about ranks and the ""this is ranked, you better be a damn good player"" mentality.But don't get me wrong, Dota 2 is a great game in itself and that's why I keep going back to it. The core mechanics are spot on and gameplay flows well. No technical issues to speak of (not counting the occasional missing texture bug or so, of which I have had none myself). Graphics are great and have a subtle water painting type feel to them. All the various spells and abilites look great. The game is very deep and complex with tons of items, skill and item builds and strategies to learn. It can be a bit terrifying to beginners, but once you get the hang of things, it's engaging. All the playable heroes are well balanced (although there is always some debate on a couple specific heroes being ""OP"") and free to play from the start. That's another thing the game does right. All the heroes are free and playable from the start, unlike Dota 2's undeniably very successful competitor, League of Legends. Dota 2's microtransactions focus on purely cosmetic stuff, which means there are zero ""pay to win"" elements in the game.It really falls unto you to decide whether if you want to suffer the rude community for the sake of playing this brilliant game. If you're one of those people who can just calmly ignore everything rude being said at you, you have a better chance of not finding Dota 2 so terrible. To put it roughly in perspective: Playing Dota 2 is like playing Skyrim, but having someone stand next to you the whole time yelling at you for every mistake you make, calling you a ""fooping idiot"" every time you miss an arrow or fail a quest objective. Failed to kill Alduin? ""Uninstall Skyrim, noob."" Don't know how to make dragonbone armor? ""Learn to play, tard."" It would just completely sap the fun out of your epic adventures, would it not? Sadly that's how Dota 2's community is.Having played the game as long as I have, I would say that you are better off not playing Dota 2. The game is fun when you're winning (because people tend to rage less when your team is doing fine), which is 50% of the time (and sometimes not even when you're winning). It isn't the losses that make the game unpleasant, it's the unfriendly people. Often your day will just be worse after playing Dota 2, instead of it cheering you up as games do. People will tell you that Dota 2 is great, but that greatness comes with a price.Do take in notice that this is all coming from a solo player point of view. This review is meant mainly to those who are likely to play the game alone most of the time and want to know what it's really like, not just the great things. If you have four friends who you can play with on a regular basis, then you're good to go. The game is at it's best when you play with friends and don't have to worry about getting ""a stick in the mud"" player on your team.Great game with bad community."

While having 1000+ hours played in LoL, and developing a strong hatred for the spanish and any other culture that speaks something close to spanish, this game has also made me develop a hatred for the russian community. As you can see, I've only played 50 odd hours of this game at the time this review was made, but if I had to add at least ONE positive note to this review, its this. I've mananged to learn russian in only a few hours, grasping the most important phrase, ""♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥"". This phrase runs through my mind, every day of every minute. I sometimes even say it to myself in my head IRL when I see someone doing something moronic. This game is a russian weapon developed by Putin himself to enslave the world, along with the help of whatever leader Brazil has right now.While most of the friends I play with play LoL, I quit that in order to seek refuge from the spanish epidemic there is over there, but instead, have been sucked into this South America/Russian racism simulator wasting most of the extra money I have on steam to buy cosmetic items for heroes I've just played.I never liked history when in school, I hated it, with a passion, just like the Americans with their hatred for the Russians. This game has taught me everything I need to know on why to hate russia, how to hate russia and question the very existance of that country based on the ape like intelligence that I've seen coming from the country.In short, if you've always been a saint in your life, never swore, never hated another culture, never thought of abusing everyone you know that doesn't speak english that well, then I'd suggest not playing MOBA's entirely, all jokes aside. If cancer had to be a game, this would be it. Without a thought. What valve has done, is develop a way of making World War 3 possible. Along with the help of Putin, and his various ape test subjects that I've encountered in the game.11/10 would keep playing."
228,"1,248.7",Recommended," May 20, 2014",51,"I'm only talking from my experience in pubs.It feels gratifying when you win.It feels frustrating when you lose.In DotA 2, you will lose alot whether you want it or not.What matters in this game isn't your hero or this pointless 'counter picking'.Your performance is solely dependant on skill, experience and reaction time.However, no matter how good you are, defeat is inevitable with a bad team.At the beginning when you're matched with new players such as yourself, this can be quite infuriating and almost made me stop playing after approximately 10 hours.That's why I strongly advise you to play with friends, so you actually have a coordinated team.About the game itself: It's a solid with a big diversity of unique heroes. The majority of the community is quite unpleasant at times and isn't very beginner-friendly which can be really off-putting. If you ignore these people (a.k.a. muting) and just keep doing your thing, you will find yourself genuinely having fun after ~50 hours. 50 hours sounds kinda extreme but it really isn't. This is the kind of game you can spend thousands of hours on and you still won't be able to fully master it.If you're ready to go through all this hardship and frustration, go for it, I highly recommend DotA 2.If you're looking for a casual multiplayer game that you can get into quickly, stay away from this."

26,"1,236.9",Not Recommended," December 13, 2016",21,"I'm going to start off with I'm a fan of Dota, it is an interesting and fun game requiring team synergy and tactical awareness. It's design is wonderfully built, its ui is easy to use, and it's all around entertaining. It's intuitive and original, and stands out in contrast with many other MOBAs. It's provided me with hours of fun. I've even invited several people to the game.Now then, everything said above is no longer true, the out-of-game ui is still fantastic, but soon as you get in-game you have to ask yourself, ""Where the ---- is anything?"" you either need a magnifying glass or superior far-sighted vision. The characters are overbalanced so unless you build a perfect team together, better luck next game. It looks like the Dev team hit copy and paste with League of Legends, the usefullness of map awareness is negated.Here, while we're putting our feet in our mouths let's do the most unoriginal character EVER, Wukong! That's right, Dota 2 is home to the most overused character on the planet, he's better than ever with a nearly perfect identity with every other MOBA on the web.Let's assume our players are willing to get headaches to play, so back to the ui, the WHAT? It's invisible, it's transparent, it's the new big THING! It's the most beautiful NOTHING you'll never lay eyes on! Oh, and you wanted to scale it? Haha, Valve thinks you're funny. Honestly, if you're going to update a game, PLAYTEST it, how is that difficult? Oh, there IS a test server you say? Who cares! Let's release all this unstable crap on our unsuspecting players.1 report is given in a 3-6 month period. That's right, if you want to report someone SAVE it for that VERY special someone, cuz you only get one chance! Commends the same way? Well, my commends haven't refreshed since october, want to know why? Cuz I play support, and my overall average scores are lower as a result.You hold on to that hope that they'll fix things, and they usually do... briefly. I've spent money on the game, know what that means? Nothing, cuz unless you unload your whole bank your words aren't even heard. Sometimes I wonder if everyone at Valve who interacts with Dota keep cats around so they can sleep on the keyboard when they decide to start trilling away ideas. When one thing breaks, break everything else to fix it.""Hm, I hear the Dota community is great... let's go try."" No no, great in this case means the rudest and cruelest gamers. If you don't have a whole group of friends to play with you get stuck with trolls or people who use their faces for they keyboards.

263,"4,046.5",Not Recommended," August 26, 2015",598,"I have played Dota 2 for a little over three years now, so I think I am finally ready to give it an in depth review. I gave this game a review back in 2013, but I am going to change that. First of all, I'm going to start by listing off what I like about the game.::THE PROS::1) Dota 2 is, obviously, a team game. Playing this game with friends is a really fun experience and can act as a source of really fantastic memories. My point is, if you play this game with a group of four other friends, Dota 2 is probably one of the best options out there.2) Dota 2 has a fantastic tutorial system and the game is very well designed to accomodate new players. A new player can go from a full AI game to an AI game with 4 other random people to playing a 5v5 online; the transition is really smooth.3) I have played both League and Dota, and I can honestly say that I think that Dota 2 is much more visually pleasing to look at. A smooth, clean UI makes the game easier on the eyes compared to League's cartoon-y design (which suits some, but not me).4) Dota has an extremely vast pool of heroes that can be played to suit almost anyone's playstyle. After you play Dota for awhile, you can pick out the heroes that really fit your playstyle and excel at them through ranked matchmaking. It's damn near impossible to be bad at literally every hero. The large hero pool (100+) allows for THOUSANDS of different lineup possibilities, meaning every game has the chance to be completely new and different than anything you've played before.5) Honestly, Dota 2 is one of the most addicting games I have ever played. No; it is THE most addicting game I have ever played. As a full-time student, I still have managed to rack up 2,500 hours in this game in my free-time. Especially back when I was a new player, I played this game all the time.However. I am actually changing my review of this game from positive to negative. Let me tell you why.::THE CONS::1) Here's my biggest flaw with the game. I absolutely hate -- I MEAN HATE -- Valve's regional matchmaking. Before finding a match, the player is supposed to change server preferences to the closest server(s) to the members of the party, and they are supposed to choose the appropriate language preference. For example, as an American player, it is expected that you choose U.S. West and U.S. East as your servers, with English as your language preference. And, generally, Americans follow this rule. HOWEVER. In almost every game I play now, I get a Peruvian or Brazilian or someone from South East Asia in my games. Hopefully it makes sense to the readers of this review that you should not be finding a match in the United States if you live in Asia. You lag, and become actually useless in the game. The South Americans, though, spam in their native languages and constantly flame. Am I generalizing? Honestly, no. I'm really not. If you are good at Dota 2, you would and should queue for games for which you are prepared to play at your best. Valve has no form of region lock on matchmaking (they really can't, due to international professional teams), and while it's really not Valve's fault, I just wish there was some way to reliably play with four people from your country and/or language. This is seriously Dota 2's biggest flaw, because so much of every game revolves around the synergy and cooperation among teammates. This is literally impossible when someone spends the entire game flaming you in a different language. I'm honestly not trying to be discriminatory in any way; this is just how Dota is in reality and is likely never to change. I have become so fed up with this poor form of matchmaking that I have actually, finally, uninstalled the game.2) Dota has actually no reliable way to punish feeders. Sure, you and your team can use the report system (you only have a limited number of reports by the way, so after you expend them on flamers or feeders you are out of luck and have to enlist the other team and your teammates to waste their reports on the other feeders and flamers). The feeder may get put in low priority, but it honestly teaches them nothing. We have all been in low prio at one point or another, and we come out unchanged. Valve needs to implement a way to correct this. I'm not alone in my view on this either. Even professional player Secret.Puppey voiced his opinion the other day, which is very similar to mine. Punishments need to become more severe.3) The Dota 2 community is actually cancerous. If you are not playing in a 5-stack of friends, I can almost promise you that you will very rarely, if ever, get on a team where all 5 teammates are willing to cooperate and play as a coordinated team. Almost every single game, someone on your team will flame someone else for sucking really bad, mostly because they probably did. But people speak so hatefully towards one another that it really feels like an unwelcoming scene. One of the professional Dota casters (joinDota's ""Capitalist"") tweeted the other day that he loses so much respect for pro players in pubs because they spend so much time flaming and tilting. This is actually about 90% of the Dota community, actually, not just the professionals. Everyone has this weird god complex where they are convinced they are better than everyone on the server, even if they got no kills and fed unimaginably badly.4) This kind of ties in with the points I have made previously. It is almost impossible to single-handedly win a game if your team is playing very poorly. Thus, the entire game comes down to teamwork; and most Dota players are unreliable teammates who will either feed or flame (90%, roughly, like I said). The 10% of people who don't flame are the people who are actually in professional teams (and while they flame in pubs, they synergize well in their professional settings (unless you are kuro and rtz)).5) Dota is really bad for your health unless you have a godly amount of self control. If you win a game, you can end happy. But if you lose a game, you keep playing and keep losing and it becomes very depressing and frustrating. The garbage community gets in your head, and it's just bad.Look, honestly, I fully expect to continue to follow the professional Dota scene. Dota really is one of the best games out there and it's especially fun to watch the pros play. But, if you are looking for a MOBA that you can regularly enjoy, then you are better off playing StarCraft II, which is where I am headed now. Don't get me wrong, though; Dota 2 is still much better than League of Legends and I would never suggest League of Legends to anyone unless they are really, really struggling with Dota 2. I won't be returning to Dota until Valve makes some much needed changes to the game, or at least until I have had a long, much-needed break from the seriously draining community that Dota offers.TL;DR: It's a good MOBA, better than LoL, but too many community & matchmaking issues to make this worth a positive. Gave me a great 3 years of entertainment though. Play SCII.Rating: 7/10Good game, for awhile. But community is horrible."

821,"2,564.1",Recommended," February 5, 2014",49,"Dota 2 is the semi-sequel/remake/re-release/evolution of the long-running WarCraft 3 mod Defense of the Ancients, which in itself was based on a custom map for StarCraft called Aeons of Strife. After the release of the original Dota map in 2003, the WarCraft 3 community began producing a long line of Dota spin-offs, sequels and mods (just as Eul, Dota's creator, had used AoS as inspiration for Dota itself), which culminated in the release of DotA: Allstars by Steve ""Guinsoo"" Feak.Allstars would become the most dominant and consistently updated version of all the Dota maps and mods. In 2005, Guinsoo passed the torch to the enigmatic IceFrog, who has been supporting, updating, and shaping Dota ever since. His changes have been the most significant, the most popular (the mod grew more during his time than ever before), and arguably have benefited and enriched Dota as a whole. By 2010, DotA: Allstars became simply DotA, and IceFrog was showing no signs of stopping. Later that year, Dota 2 was formally announced (with its development spear-headed by both IceFrog and Eul, both of its most important ""authors""; its past and present, alike), entered a semi-closed beta in late 2011, and was finally officially released in mid-2013... and the rest is history.History lessons aside, Dota 2 is a game of uncompromising depth and complexity. Though its gameplay intricacies can appear opaque, arbitrary and incomprehensible at first sight, the way these expansive game mechanics interact with one another when exposed to the element of player imperfection is truly remarkable: over a hundred heroes, each with at least four spell-based abilities and all capable of using up to six magical items, from a massive arsenal of over a hundred. Games can last anywhere from 25 to 55 minutes, and possibly far more!Dota's metagame is constantly shifting, and as of writing the game and mod are at total parity through version 6.80, released earlier this year. On top of that, it is completely free to play, with no features locked out to any players whatsoever. Not even cosmetic items, which form the backbone of the game's vast micro-transaction-based economy: these items are freely distributed by Valve to all players through level-based gift drops and random-chance item drops. Free game updates alter the game balance significantly, while introducing new seasonal game modes, and far more. And that's not even scratching the surface of the game's competitive scene, with its many tournaments, its constantly evolving teams and its own storylines, all leading up to the annual Valve-organized grand championship: The International.It may be incredibly difficult and frustrating at first, but given time, patience, simple memory and a keen mind, anyone can ultimately come to see Dota as perhaps the most enjoyable, enthralling and captivating game experience ever conceived.

A mod that has been worked on by many, and therefore it was hard to determind where the rights belong. A lot of legal hocus pocus were going on between Blizzard and Valve last year, and it ended to valve's favor. The Dota name and franchise is now legally a part of Valve, probably thanks to the sneaky acquisition of IceFrog the year before.Dota 2 is a real-time strategy game in the sub-genre called MOBA (multiplayer online battle arena). A genre that has grown rapidly the past few years, with different type of alterations in favor of success. Dota 2 is a close second to being the most popular MOBA, right behind the giant League of Legends. Just like LoL, Dota 2 is gaining success throughout it's competetive e-sport scene, and it's clear that valve is highly pushing it towards the first position. The latest and biggest tournament was The International 2013, which included a total prize pool of over 2.8 million US dollars, which was the biggest prize pool in e-sport history.Gameplay is easy to understand but very hard to master. The map consists of 3 lanes that are constantly being pushed by NPC creeps. You are controlling a hero amongst 4 other in your team, and are fighting against 5 in the opposing team. The goal is to push your heroes and NPC creeps to the enemy base, where you have to destroy the ancient. It sounds pretty easy, but it requires hours upon hours to get a hold of the base mechanics, the more advanced mechanics and the professional mechanics. Plus the over 100 heroes you get to play and face.After 300 hours I have only touched what I call the more advanced mechanics, and I am not even close to professional level. The most experienced players have around 5000 hours of playtime and have spend the majority of their past 3 years to Dota 2. Since the game is Extremely competetive there will be a lot of curse words flying around while you play. These type of games are known for very hostile encounters with other players. There is an optional tutorial that you can take before going out there, beware though - the tutorial does not cover any Russian.Dota 2 might be competetive, extremely enraging and the learning curve is steep as crap, but it is still the game that I have spend the most time playing on Steam (mostly because my collegues and bosses were playing it). Somehow I keep returning to it, so I suppose I am enjoying it. You better have people to play with though, and you better not be good friends - because this game will take your beloved friendship and wipe it's♥♥♥♥♥with it until you hate each other.Translations:"

322,"1,471.5",Recommended," November 12, 2013",33,"Dota stands for ""Defense of the Ancients"", or as I like to call it, Dota. The two is not to refer to the game being a sequel, which it is, but rather to specify the number of ancients in a game. The objective is to turn it into Dota 1.In Dota, you need to defend an ancient, which is either a tree or a rock depending on your religious affiliation. Since I'm one and two-thirds Bhuddist, I usually end up defending one of them at random, much like all the other players.Dota is a very unique game, in that includes both offense and defense. There are lots of characters, and all of them are mostly good at different things.In my opinion, the best part of Dota is playing it. This is because Dota is an extremely unique combining many difficult strategies, such as attacking the enemy team's Ancient or defending your own Ancient.The goal of Dota, much like other games, is to win. If you become proficient at this skill, you will win very often, leading to more victories. Scientists show that six out of every three Dota players that win matches tend to be on the winning team when the game is over. This is because winning substantially increases your chances of not losing.Dota takes a while to learn though, and that is because it is an extremely offensive, yet defensive, game with many complicated nuances, like being a farmer or trying to help your teammates do good. One interesting feature of Dota is that dying is really bad, in the sense that you lose money and time because respawns are really long, like when Halo 3 would just beep at you instead of spawning you and you'd get really angry, except this is an intentional feature intended to spice up the classic innovation of offfense vs. defense vs. offense.Why did I write a third position in that last sentence? Excellent question. There are neutral enemies in the game, and they usually don't do a whole lot except sit there and be neutral. If you don't respect their space, however, you may find that they beging to fight back, much like an offensive form of self-defense.Early in a match of Dota, you find yourself buying useful items like tp scrolls, also called Town Portal Scrolls, or Town Portal Scrolls for short. Why did I mention Town Portal Scrolls multiple times? Good question! That is because there are multiple teams.Once you've bought items, you go kill enemy creeps, and they aren't people so it's ethically sound and completely morally fine to do. :) Once you've spilt some blood, or watched as they comically struggle to kill each other for your favor, you may realize that you have more money and have leveled up. That is because creeps are made of gold stitched together by experience and points, and that usually transfers to you after they die. Think of it like inheritance or maybe a n involuntary tribute system.Once you've levelled up and gotten rich, you can buy better items that make you stronger, and then get new abilities like skills, active abilities, passive abilities, or passive-aggressive abilities. These abilities let you hurt creeps and other palyers more effectively, which may or may not be socially acceptable in your region of birth. Please refer to local ethic codes and statutes to determine whether victory is a viable gameplay style for you in your chosen country of choice.Once you've become the best all-around person you can be, or at least made some incremental progress down that road that usually takes about an hour on average, (resets between games, so you never get bored) it's time to go tear down the other team's towers (those, like many buildings in the united states, canada, or certain US territories, will fight back and damage you) and then eventually go and destroy their Ancient, which is what the A stands for in Dota. That makes your team the winner, and implies that you are better people in a metaphorical sense than your enemy team counterparts."

Sure. But the enjoyment always fought against the weight of the overwhelming frustration.It has the most toxic community I have ever seen in my decade of serious gaming. It wasn't so bad at first, but over the past hundred or so games it has become notably worse. Far worse. Make one mistake and you will have threats from your teammates to report you. Don't have a bad game, or you will have someone urging your team and the other team to report. It's just constant bickering and trash talk on both sides. Is it like this every game? No, of course not. There are decent individuals who play this game who will present constructive criticism and encouragement in a mature fashion. They might contain their frustration during the game or voice it over the chat, and that's understandable. This game will do that. But the vast majority are, sadly, among the poison that kills this game for me.A lot of the time I even ended up with teammates who didn't speak my language despite my search under US east. I can handle one or two or three or four. But when I go three games in a row where everyone on my team and the enemy team doesn't speak my language then, well, there is some great team communication there. That's really the only issue I've had with the game itself. Not too bad.The satisfaction from winning a few games can't make up for the stress and grievances encountered to get there either.Honestly, this game isn't fun anymore because of the community. It is well done. It's a great game, but the community ruins the satisfying experience I once had for this game. It is a real shame.I have 2,000+ hours of game time. 2,000+ hours of effort getting myself to around a 3k MMR. 2,000+ hours poured into a game that requires dedication and satisfaction through numbers and stats. And I am still going to try my best to give this game up despite all the work put into it. It will be tough.If you haven't played the game yet, I can't recommend it. Not when the community is worse than it's ever been. And I'm not basing this on just a couple dozen games. I'm basing my community experience on hundreds of recent hours. It is a real shame how the players in the game can ruin it.Maybe when Overwatch comes out it will have a decent community (being optimistic) and I can pour my hours into that and finally ditch this game for good. Maybe I'll come back when my friends are on to form a team, but I will never again jump into solo ranking with the community as horrible as it is.I really hate to leave a negative review on this great game, but the community has sucked the joy out of it."

2,"1,837.2",Not Recommended," October 5, 2017",705,"TL;DR: Don't even start! Toxic community, destroys your life.(edit: don't miss out on the comments of this review!)The first time I played Dota was 10 years ago when it was still on WC3. I stopped playing for some years and got back to playing since last year. Two reasons why you should avoid this at all cost:1. Toxic community: the worse out there! It is almost a given that someone on your team or the enemy team will start some aggressive flaming for no good reason. Racist remarks are the norm. Whenever somone dies, someone else gets blamed/flamed. Extremely toxic! After enough hours of gameplay, this type of exposure is bound to spillover on you and give you a very negative outlook of life. What I noticed in me and my friends is that this blaming/flaming culture influences us that we tend to unknowingly flame others back in response. Definitely not the kind of person I want to be. Don't expose yourself to such negativity in life!2. While the gameplay is amazing, keep in mind that this game is highly addictive. I once told my friend that he can do so many other things in life if he doesn't play dota. His response was ""If i don't do other things in life, I can dota more."" I feel like this is the best way to describe how addictive this game can be. He plays at higher level games (5k+ MMR). He has since stopped, and I'm so proud of him. Before, he used to play all day for over 10 hours until 5am in the morning. Neglected college and everything else. I fell into that same rabbit hole. I averaged 40-50 hours a week of dota. Totally soul sucking and toxic. I started having to hide this addiction and not tell others because of the shame of spending so much time on a video game. Neglected college and life. I stopped going out, stopped socializing. Most of the interaction I encounter everyday is from the toxic community. You can imagine how much I degraded. Because this addiction took over my life, I feel that my mental state of mind is so poor now. Low confidence in doing everything else because of all the time wasted in dota.So, this is kinda like my confession here. A way to help me break out of this, and a reminder to not relapse into such a unhealthy and pathethic state of living. Do yourself a favour and focus on real life, which matters and lasts. Don't waste hundreds and thousands of hours on this game that will not add to anything in your life; it will only bring you negativity.Live life to the fullest. Time is the one thing you can NEVER get back. Do not regret."
237,"1,806.2",Recommended," February 16, 2014",59,"This brand new game by Riot puts a spin on the definition of ""Casual Gaming"". What consumers thought would be another fun and enjoyable experience for the family turned out to be much more. This game is called ""Dota 2"" which is an acronym for ""Delicious Orange Teamwork Association 2"", the sequel to the original DOTA.DOTA 2 revolves around 2 teams of 5 players each (the perfect number for a happy family and maybe even a friend to all sit down on the couch and play together as a team) who are both trying to sell as many oranges as possible while sabotaging the enemy team's orange sales!Gameplay is very casual and easy to pick up. You don't even have to play the tutorial if you don't want to! Just jump in the game, let everyone know you're new and start selling oranges!Speaking of new players, those who are new to the DOTA universe might be a little discouraged by all the terms that more experienced players use, so I'll explain a few of them here.-""Feeding"" is when your team is selling oranges at a very fast rate. This is very good, so make sure you feed as much as possible!-""♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; is a term you may see thrown around a lot by players of this game. DOTA is a very popular game in Russia, because it is developed by a mysterious individual named ""Ice Man"" who is from Russia! ""♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; is a friendly term that roughly translates to ""Keep up the good work!""-""Report"" When someone says ""Reported."" or ""Im going 2 report u!"" that means that they are filling out a sales report on how well you've sold oranges! This is a fun way to keep track of how good you are at the game, and it's considered friendly to try to report the best players you see in a game, even if they're on the enemy team!DOTA 2 has over fifty dozen players on at a time, so you better get playing now and become a veteran because before you know it, everyone and their grandmas will be playing the new nation-sweeping casual game DOTA 2!"

677,"1,400.3",Recommended," October 14, 2014",74,"Dota 2 is a very highly skilled game, don't expect to walk in and expect you being very good. You are going to die alot and probably yell at your team mates but that's just the nature of this game. Dota 2 takes place in an arena where you will fight to destory the enemies Anicent if you destory it; you win.The Ancient is protected by 11 stuctures called towers that protect it. Each of these towers are found in each of the three lanes bottom, middle and top. You take control of a unit that is a hero, many of them are diverse and have a lot of pros and cons such as Crystal Maiden who is really good at locking down heros early game with her stun but she is also the slowest hero in the game.You are accompanied by 4 other players including yourself to fight against another 5 players. You need to push lanes to be able to destory the enemy towers in each lane but the catch is the enemy team is doing the same thing, so you need to not only push to your victory but to stop the enemy team from pushing aswell.There is 107 heros in Dota 2 out of the 112 heroes that are in the Warcraft III. They are categorised into 3 groups. Strenght, which are usually the tanky guys. Agility, most carries are found in this category and Intelligence which most of the supports are usually found. All these heroes have different skill levels, such as Invoker who is an intelligence hero with 14 spells. He is able to create spells with 4 of his spells, creating the other 10. He is able to create tornados which disable enemies, meteors which looks epic and burns enemies that stand in front of it. Just an all round crazy hero. Viper is arguably the easiest hero which as 2 passive spells (Passive spells are spells that work all the time, you don't need to activate them) and 2 other spells which are targetable.You can customise your Dota experience with annoucer packs which change the voice of the annoucer which include Glados and the narrator from the Stanley Parable. You can change your HUD to different themes.The game allows you to buy tickets where you can support tournments, some of these tournments allowing you to directly contribute to the prize pool. Most of the time it is 25%. In 2014, The International is a annual tournment created by Valve for Dota 2. In 2014, the prize pool for this tournment became 10.9M dollars. First place got 5M dollars! If you are into ESports then this game will be up your ally.Dota 2 is a hard game, but if you look in the right places you are able to learn a lot, if you aren't sure you want to play this game, you can PM me and I can teach you how to play. I honestly don't mind."

48,"4,457.1",Not Recommended," July 26, 2016",176,"At this point in time, I've wasted round 3-5 years of my life playing this game.It's a small amount compared to the hours that my peers and teammates have amassed, even I, who had started when beta was released to the general public. A good chunk of the gaming population has played it at least once, or have heard of it, or am still playing even as type this review out.Anywho, let's talk about Dota.Dota 2 is not a game; it's a major time sink. You spend the first 100-200 games improving your gameplay to be even called ""below average"", whilst losing horribly in every single one. You will weep. Burst in an outrage. Asking yourself why did you ever choose to play this game in the first place.Every single game roughly consists of 40-50 mins that you give all your efforts to be returned with a fleeting feeling of joy. Bliss. Or the soul crushing depression of losing the past 10 games during the weekend - the times you turned down your friends at a night out to play this game.It's not because Dota is hard. No, no. It's not the mechanics that you have fine-tuned yourself in being able to do over and over a 100 times without messing up.In my words, it could very well be as easy as playing Hello Kitty Island Adventure or as ball crushing hard as playing Dark Souls with no proper equipment - simply because the game boils down to one thing:Teamwork. Synergy between people, how they cooperate, willingly or not. More often at times you're going to have the most disillusioned people with a lexicon of a drunk jaded middle-aged man who's going through a mid life crisis rather than the quiet, reserved player who tries his/her best in assisting your efforts in a win.It can be argued that the game can be won single-handedly by a skilled player, but it's a pipe dream to seek that out, for most of the general population - but it does not deter them from doing so, which leads to yet another problem/frustration within the game.People seek glory within it; they yearn the temporary recognition it brings, and those players put their teammates beneath them, which ultimately loses them the game.In short there are a lot of different reasons and expectations of the game, which may cause conflicts ultimately losing you the game. Save yourself the trouble and do something else.Edit - For those of you who cant math for some reason, 4k hours over 4 years is roughly 3 games a day assuming its a game is an hour on average."

He said ""movimiento♥♥♥♥♥♥quot;, I think it means ""I got your back"", What a nice guy. Dota is great and all but there are a few problems with some heros, like bloodseeker, Phantom Assassin, Faceless void, And huskar. They need to be buffed, I find them extrememly underwhelmed. Bloodseekers ult cd is just too long and needs to be lowered to ten seconds, Phantom assassin needs a higher crit ratio, faceless needs more evasion and movement speed, and huskar's flaming spear should cost no hp. Oh and there's one other hero needs to be nerfed hard, Bat rider is just too overpowered and unbalanced. I think he has too much hp, and the base should be lowered to 320, also lower his base movement speed to 200. Aside from those few problems dota 2 is the best FPS I have ever played in my life."

The game consists of two 5-man teams with each player choosing a unique hero and fighting to destroy the opposing team's throne. It sounds simple enough, but once you mix in the seemingly myriad number of heroes to choose from, the race to level up faster than your opponents, and the vast array of items to buy, you have one of the deepest and most competitive games on the planet."

It was hard to pinpoint one specific reason why I disliked the viewing experience, there are so many changes to this once great game it's really hard to put the feelings into plain text, its almost unrecognizable from previous versions. Nevertheless, I tried to honestly reflect on my thoughts and have covered some of the issues I've noticed and that the caster pointed out as well, see below.At face value, and for me personally, the game seems to have generally lost what made it so special to begin with - it was different than the other MOBA's, it had its own unique identity and old school feel. I feel that this is due to the very gradual changes/improvements that patches have brought over the years, never straying too far from the core gameplay. Change is good and inevitable in many cases, but this isn't change, this is almost a new game. The game feels dumbed down/too easy in some respects (6x runes/talent trees/less emphasis on item progressions/item countering/arcady feel) but also too complicated in some respects (horrible pathing/lame fighting areas with too many stairs and jungle juke spots/extra towers in the jungles/small hud that fs up my focus/vital info being hidden or taken out completely etc etc etc). Basically what most people are saying on here is how I am feeling as well - if you're one of the people who puts their arms up and says go into more detail, please just ask, I would be happy to elaborate.Now... The caster, who has been playing basically since dota inception (and was also once a beta tester for icefrogs patches) kept noting how terribly ""boring"" the update is, and compared many of the changes to games like LOL/HOTS. I personally found it refreshing to hear someone with loads of experience break down some of the shortcomings of this new patch as not many high level dota players have as of yet (why would they bite the hand that feeds I guess). There were several specific points made as to why the new patch has fallen short and I wish I could remember exactly what all of his points were. Nevertheless, one thing that stood out was when the caster spoke about the new runes, which he disliked very much. This sort of sums up what he said: The new runes effectively force players to go to point X at time X, and if you don't you're missing out. It feels like a forced meta, and that there is now a very specific formula to the game that promotes less creativity. Support players can hangout in jungles to collect runes etc most of the early game, pick up their talent tree exp or gold bonus or w.e and then start 5 manning. In general, he felt that whoever has the better lineup tends to win, and thought that many games were effectively won or lost at the draft (obviously there's more to it but I thought it was an interesting statement). He also absolutely ripped into the new HUD - however i think most players tend to agree (even the ones who call out the 'whiners') that the HUD sucks and will most likely continue to be overhauled. He also mentioned that, although there is not much public outcry from the pros, that behind closed doors many of the pro players are extremely disappointed with the new direction of the game. He covered many other issues that I do not have the time/energy/memory to touch on but as you can tell..I care deeply for this game. I am not the type of person to come on forums to talk ♥♥♥♥/complain but I felt forced to in this case.. I have not abandoned the game yet as I think that is a premature knee jerk reaction, however, I am abstaining from the current state of the game until (I hope) changes are made."

113,"2,417.0",Not Recommended," January 11, 2015",751,"After wasting my +2000 hours on it, i think i can say something about this game.First of all, this review is not a humorous one. I'm writing it seriously to give information about this game. Because it is so popular and too many people want to learn something about it including who has never played it and starters. I think this review will be informative for these people, gamers who has spent couple of hours like me, knows everything i am going to try to tell.After this short introduction, we can start:-Russians' problem is not about being Russian. Due to the game's popularity among Russian players, there are too many bad (always swears, doesnt play as its a team game, doesnt speak english in eu servers etc.) Russian players. But there are also too many nice Russian players. Briefly, the problem is not about being Russian, if there are 10 gamers in dota, 4 of them will be bad players, if there are 1000, 400 of them. Thats the point.-If you want to play this game to get relaxed, dont do it. After few matches you will find yourself more depressed, angry or sick instead of relaxed or enjoyed. The bad players are the reason for it. As an illustriation; you started a game to get enjoyed, looked the picks, someone rushed carry heroes without saying anything and suddenly said ""me mid"" or ""me solo"" etc., ok thats right you are still relax, you picked a support for your team, they somehow fed the enemies, ok still you are relaxed, they started to argue with each other, they started to swear and fed the enemy team on purpose just because of their arguement, ok you are still trying to convince them to stop it but you feel angry, and then you will lose the game. This type of games are not so rare in dota. 3 over 10 games are being played according to this nutshell. Therefore, it is highly possible that you will find yourself in a very bad mood instead of enjoyed after playing dota.-Then, why people still playing it too much? Why there is not just bad players in the community now? Because it is addictive. You can not get rid of it. If someone trolls your game, you want to play again and wish to play with better players, if you win the game, you want to win again and increase your mmr, if you lose the game you want to play again to get your mmr back. Shortly, you will want to play again after every game. However, if you are sure that you can stop playing whenever you want, this reason is pointless for you.-Meaningless mmr system. When i first heard about mmr system i was quite excited. Because it ideally provides an environment that includes less trolls and bad players. However, the system is completely meaningless. Player profile and skills are same at 1k,2k and 3k mmr. Once you get your mmr, it is very hard to increase it too much since every win increase it 25, every lose decrease it 25 and as i said before, player profile is same at 1k 2k and 3k, when you have a bad player in your team it is nearly impossible to win that game etc. It is completely up to your team. So, how people get too high mmr's? They have this mmr at the begining. And how they did it? There is no clear information about it. Valve does not announce how it is being calculated. For example, i played 10 first ranked games with 8 wins, i played support and carries, buy wards and couriers when i was support, i carried the game almost on my own when i was carry, but my mmr was 2200 when some people get 4k starting mmr. This system also a fact about this game's addiction but doesn't help kind players about creating a better environment.-All in all, i dont recommend this game just because of its community. The game is a master piece, master of MOBAs, it is a great thing that only you can spend your money on cosmetic items in the game, it has great graphics etc. However, it has a really bad community and you will find yourself as one of those bad players when you play more and more and it becomes impossible to get rid of it. On the other hand, if you have a great mental power and patience, play it, i completely recommend it. This review was written for normal patience leveled people. I dont say ""Dont waste your time, go and do some social activities"", if u want to play video games, dont play it go and play more enjoying games.-Lastly, i have an advice for valve, it would be better if there will be an administrator system in dota. People who works professionally and for money for this administrator job would examine players' matches who get reports too much and if they see that they are bad players (as defined at the beginning) they should be banned from game for few days or their mmrs should be decreased. Now, it is done completely automatic and so after some low priority matches bad players can continue trolling.I hope it would be helpful for people who hasnt spent too much time on dota and it would be read by people except from my friends :D************************Some Suggestions************************I wrote this review when this game made me feel so bad and desperate. I lost my will to play dota. However then, thanks to some sensitive comments, I started to play dota only with my friends. Now I have some suggestions for people who have similar feelings about dota as I mentioned in my review months ago.-As some people say in comments of this review, play this game with your friends. After writing this review I have rarely played solo games and it feels better.-Participate in some tournaments. After lots of bad pub match experiences, that tournament atmosphere offers a great dota experience. You can participate in ESL's or other platforms' open tournaments for free.-Finally,never give up! You can encounter very kind players as well. After a bad pub game performance, your teammates maybe say ""uninstall dota"" etc. but after then you can participate in tournaments with your friends. Just do not give any importance what they say. You can see similar things in this review's comments section. There are very kind, sensitive and suggestive comments which try to help me and lots of depressing, offensive comments. Same is true for the player profile in dota, just dont give any importance what the haters say!***Final Note***For the guys who say ""why don't u recommend the game while playing it too much"", please read the review again, this review is a complete answer to your question.GOOD LUCK & HAVE FUN :DUNFORTUNATELY, IO LOST THE ARCANA SHOWDOWN (2015) :(UNFORTUNATELY, IO LOST THE ARCANA SHOWDOWN AGAIN , BUT THIS TIME AT FINAL STAGE (2016) :(Edited: Game hours are updated and some grammar mistakes are corrected.

4,"8,267.3",Recommended," January 6, 2012",29,This is basically dota 1 with an upgraded user interface and graphics. It’s still a work in progress but all in all this is what the original dota style gameplay needs if it’s going to increase its declining marketshare in the moba genre it itself once pioneered.The spectator interface for viewing live games is impressive and though it seems the matchmaking algorithm is not really active at the moment for a beta the parts that work do so rather well. The attack and spell animations are all reworked and changed in this version so even for old dota 1 vets there is much to learn that only comes with the experience of engaging in the matches themselves.If you can get an invite and you like the MOBA genre you will find far more to like than not. But as usual in these types of games it all comes down to how evenly paired both teams are in skill for a game to truly fire on all cylinders.

Except for one thing they decided to put a disease into the game in the form of monkey king. 200% crit with a 2 second stun AND 1200 god damn range nice job OSfrog pogchamp. Oh wait there's more passive ability after 4 hits on a single hero gives 200 (??!?!??!) bonus damage and 50% lifesteal. Add the two together and you get everything dies at 8 minutes in one hit. BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE!! Let's give this melee hero an attack range of 9 billion because he has a cool staff. Kappa. We aren't even going to talk about his ultimate which gives him even MORE damage. Was excited for this hero had really cool and unique abilities like tree jumping and everything but then they decided that they wanted him to kill everyone and all their ancestors going back 68400 years with his Q. Nice.Other than that the update is great and fun but too bad every single game has monkey kappa in it because he's new and OP nice nice nice. Never been as salty by a hero as this before it actually made me pull a muscle because of how angry i was. nice.So in review, 7.00 gets a 8.6/10 but then monkey king is a solid -8.6/10 so there you go nice job OSfrog its now a 0.UPDATE: DONT WASTE UR TIME IM STUFCK IN THIS♥♥♥♥♥♥HOLE NICE GAME PLS"

But this review is going to talk about my personal negative experience as a player whose played the matchmaking and the community that you will experience and to warn new players of what they may experience themselves if they decide to try this game.So after pouring a huge chunk of my life into this game, I have decided to finally quit and move on with my life.I have neglected real life responsiblities because of this game (spending time with my wife and kid). I have also wasted time on this game that I could have spent playing many, many other games that are in my steam library that have basically rotted for the past 4 years.Almost every match I have played left me with some sort of rage inside or anger that I couldn't let go of until I started another match and sometimes that match that follows would continue until I have a winning match. To be honest though the rage and anger definintely outweighs the happiness and slight adrenaline rush from winning a match.I would not recommend this game to someone new who is wanting to start into MOBAS or even looking to start a new game. It has sucked many hours from my life that I farily regret spending, as well as money that I spent on cosmetic/skins. This money and time could have been spent on family matters or bills, something that is 100% more important than a game. Although money isn't neccesarry to play the game to the fullest, it is just something that will taunt you when playing; seeing the shiny skins for heroes on your homepage and sales for items can be alitte tempting at times.Something else that you see people mentioning in reviews is that the community is absolutely toxic, which is entirely true. Almost every match you will run into rage filled people that will say anything and everything to make you feel terrible about your self which in turn makes you play worse, even if you aren't neccesarily playing that bad.I will say though the games mechanics and design is very well done and is very enjoyable for the most part, just everything else mentioned in my review kind of outweighs it.I want to say goodbye to DOTA 2 once and for all. Finally I can continue on with my life as a normal person."

You'll rely on your team to preform their selected roles, and then watch in horror as they completely ignore the game mechanics and just chase down kills, rarely successfully. You build in game items during the match to enhance your characters role and then hope and pray your team doesn't feed the opposition too much. Team fights, normally 5v5, tend not to happen as you watch your fellow team members run to meet their fate and be a hero. Sadly this ends up throwing the game and you lose. I would still recommend this game, purely for those few matches when the your whole teams synergy is in harmony, watch as the gold floods in, heroes get trampled, the towers crumble and the opposition blame each other for their loss."

In the early 2000s, when I had a lot of free time, Quake 3, Elite Force, Jedi Knight 2, et cetra all took up a ton of my time; but as my age progressed, I had less time to dedicate to gaming. Mass Effect 1 and 2 both took about 100 hours away from me; but that was probably the most I'd invested in many years.I currently have around 500 hours of Dota 2, and don't plan on stopping anytime soon. The gameplay is spectacular, the community is great (I have made more Steam friends on this game than any other), the meta is interesting, the professional scene is a blast to watch, and the game is extremely well supported - especially with the recent Wraith Night/Legion Commander content update.The thing is that I'm not great at Dota 2. I've put almost 500 hours in, and there's still more for me to learn - there are still some heroes I have yet to play! It is a lot of investment, but once you 'get' it, you will have an absolute blast.EDIT: Just updating this now that I've put around 1600 hours in.I still completely stand by everything that I said previously. The game is super fun, and I'm really enjoying playing with all of the friends I've made in it. I've also experienced some of the negative parts of the community, and they're unfortunate; but I must say that they are far and few between. The community is largely welcoming, and I've made some fantastic friends through it - ones I hang out with in real life now.Definitely play the game, the learning curve is steep but entirely worth it."

279,"3,689.4",Recommended," October 25, 2014",180,"In-depth, competitive, scientifically proven, approved by Church of England and American Monster Truck foundation,true MLG review on award-winning game: Heroes of League Of Autists 2.Alright, guys, listen. My name is [IG] D[andi] SingSing aka Wild♥♥♥♥♥Digger1998UA and i will throw some of my wild gameplay suggestions in a game that is totally not corrupted by trends, pro leagues where people play like lobsters on acid (denying your own aegis because you click like a frenzied ape when nothing around is happening) and totally not toxic community where every Ivan, George and PingPongClingClong is a distinguished pro gamer with 200 years of training at Icefrog's monastery of enlightement somewhere inbetween Tibet's asscheeks.Okay, let's go: This riding on cat Mirana chick with face that looks like she just seen a dolphin putting on a condom. Her ultimate allows teammates to get invisibility for given time. Which can, for instance, save your carry+ support who is getting dived by frenzied Bristleback and enemy mid hero with 2 runes up his butt. So just press r - and since they didnt have any dusts - your carry is safe. Haha, no! We can't have any of that! I need more damage on my arrow that i will miss anyway. Plus if my allies are dying, i can just blame them instead of doing anything. If they are russians - just double your blame output.Okay, so we have that hero, Spector, but it doesnt look like this gay guy from Bioware game. So she has ability to move through obstacles and units, has free tons of pure damage (can't be reduced by armor) on every illusion, and map presense with her ultimate that allows her to fight at any given time without leaving her farming spots until necessary, and with high enough agility her illusions can just inflict enough damage so your team can fight freely while you patiently taking your farm. SO WHAT DO WE DO? OF COURSE WE AINT GONNA DO ANY OF THAT: we will get her phase boots because spectral dagger is clearly not enough, we will never ever get free damage on carry, and we get a bloody skill that blocks and returns damage instead (when enemy team has like. ugh, same damage output as yours?and you have no hp yet anyway?). Get vanguard that just doesn't work because of dota 2's RNG programming and then will farm radiance till 50' timemark because expensive aura with item's green damage that doesnt work on illusions (even though aura does work and can do a lot of good things, like blocking enemy's blink dagger that will be blocked by your ult in a second anyway) is clearly better than stat-gain or mana-burn.Okay, so we have that orange bird guy, that can hold solo lane against 2 or 3 people with minimum deaths (except some specific combos that just screw up his escape) and set of abilities that allows to eviscerate enemy team if your allies have at least ANYTHING to hold them in place. What are we gonna do with this hero, you may ask. Of course we will put him on a support role and make him buy mekansm, so he would never have any mana for his high damage dots that also have ridicilous slow debuff and ult that is easily countered only like by ten heroes out of 150. We have Mirana without ultimate to go get all this exp, remember?Alright, these situations are obviously too situative, so we will talk about global scale meta:Let's get to most obvious question: what hero should we pick? The answer is - PUDGE.You need mid - you pick PUDGE. You need support - you pick PUDGE. You need offlane, jungler, roamer, carry, social worker, girlfriend, president of the united states of 'Murrica? - Just pick Pudge. Why? Because someone did that on twitch.tv, you silly noob cheekyscrublord.You, of course, have same skill as pro players so you can just mimic them and game will be magically won! You don't need to think about anything, just buy recommended items and blame your teammates if something is wrong. You got a motherflipping DRAGONCLAW HOOK afterall. If you bought an item that is worth of 3 years of your school lunchboxes - nobody will have enough guts to argue with your divine skill in pressing q button at cursor location to lasthit a creep (mute everyone at the start of the game just in case tho).Next important issue is map presense, lane control, creep control, ability to analyze situation, counter-warding and all that important elements of this pseudo-strategical game. For all of that just remember these two lines:""BUY WARDS""""WHERE THE GANG"" (it is important that you will never type ""gank"" properly).This is basically all you need to know about this game. Remember: its not important to win! It's the whole competetive spirit and sportsmanship that matters! Everyone has around 50% winrate anyway because of matchmaking, and ELO system in rankeds is based on wizard-science and tarot-fortunetelling (it's supposed to work only in chess anyway). Yeah, developers may tell you their rating system is not based on elo, but can Volvo really pull off their own mathematic rating model for the game that after all these years still lags when someone is picking a hero, armor rating still doesnt work properly, and hero with 320 movespeed can chase down and kill hero with 350 because of model animation? Oooh i think not.Anyway i give this game 100 dirty apes out of 100 and encourage you to start playing as fast as possible, to join in most viral addiction the world ever saw since taking heroin rectally, poping polyethylene packages or throwing water filled condoms out of the window became a thing."

Instead of hitting creeps, destroying towers and raging on teammates.You might think of e-sport at some point. But game is not worth the candle. Just sit down and calculate chances yourself if you are seriously considering earning money playing it.If you just want to chill at weekends with friends playing a few matches - go for it, this is a great way to do it. But if I were you I would go to a nearby bar and find a good company and some adventures instead, it is far more interesting and profitable.Not recommended.EDIT: Nice discussion in comments.

I commend Dota for always bringing something new and always expanding the heros, gameplay, map, etc. on a very regular basis, however, this most recent patch missed the mark.It feels too much like LOL now, which was the reason this game was such a success in my opinion. It didnt have that childlike feel gameplay and did not need to distract players with fancy huds and split screens, it was all about the game play first and foremost. I've played a few games since the update has been released and they just went too far too fast, the modifications to the map where necessary, but they went too far with the runes now on dire and radiant side of the river. The initial 30 seconds of the game were what also made Dota interesting. It would force team fights, even though the teams may not have even wanted to engage. This new method is too safe and breeds farmers in the game rather than team fights. Coupled with the new map, the new hud, new hero, new buffs and nerfs, all too much too fast in my opinion and will not be playing this game for awhile until it's been rebalanced. Thumbs down for now."

625,"4,585.4",Recommended," August 8, 2013",938,"Dota 2 is quickly becoming the most played game on Steam, and for good reason. The blend of well-balanced multiplayer, infinite replayability, gorgeous aesthetics, and the time and care Valve has put in to support the community is a recipe for perfection. I simply cannot reccomend Dota 2 enough.The game boasts a roster of over a hundred heroes, and each one feels unique and well-designed. In any given match, you take control of a singular hero, and victory or defeat hinges not only on how well you play that hero, but how also on how well you synergize with your five person team.Unfortunately, the barrier of entry is high. Quite a lot of research, preparation, and knowledge is required to be sucessful, and it can be frustrating losing repeatedly. However, tutorials are available to guide new players, and the time spent learning only adds to the satisfaction of landing a five-man Black Hole or pulling off that perfect Blink-Poof combo.Spectacularly enough, the battlefield is not the only area where the game shines. Dota TV is an in-game spectator mode that allows the option to watch professional teams play in tournaments, including the multi-million dollar International that Valve hosts on a yearly basis.And all of this for free. There are cosmetic items that can be used to customize your favorite hero, however nothing availble changes gameplay in any way. They are mostly designed by members of the community and can be purchased or recieved randomly while playing.Content patches and new heroes are being added all the time. Dota 2 will continue to grow for years, hopefully continuing to find new players interested in a fast-paced online multiplayer experience that is equal parts exhilirating and engaging."

Theyre're not just noobs, they just love trolling and ****ing up others people fun.If you're noob and wish to play Dota, make sure you have patience and time. Becoming good in this game is really hard, takes years to master and you'll never get to call yourself a pro.If you decided to start Dota, DO NOT play online. Practice with bots first, read guides, read items and abilities descriptions first, you got to study before playing in a real game with humans. It can be very frustrating for old players to deal with people that simple come to ''try out'' a new game into their matches and ruin them. Please. Someday you will realize what i mean with this.I play DotA since 2007 (Dota 1) and I have hit my keyboard, laughed, yell'd to my girlfriend for no reason and even let my bad mood affect my scores in school because instead of studying math, I decided to stay late playing and made me lose time I could spend with friends. Lost many good stuff I could have done out-game because I said ''One more match...'' which became 10 more matches... and ended up totally frustrated without winning one of them, unable to sleep well those nights. Due to this, to the careless community and the fact that your mood can be affected by DotA and how it makes you feel, i can't recommend this game.Dota is not just another game to your library. You have to be very careful when you decide to play this."
203,22.2,Not Recommended," April 6, 2014",93,"Reposting since under the old review system I would be forced to ""recommend"" that people play this.This game is like a shower fight between you and another naked man. You're both in a small shower tub trying desperately to shove each other over while at the same time trying not to accidentally touch peens and catch the gay.When you slip over and land painfully on your ♥♥♥ the other guy, completely by accident, gets his soap-stained foot into your mouth just as you both realize somebody downstairs is hogging all the hot water. Then one of the guys from downstairs who should be helping you get back up on your feet instead comes into the room and yells at you for stealing all the hot water even though it's the other way around.You're the noob who can't get better at naked shower fights no matter how hard you try, the other guy in the tub is the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ from the enemy team who mains bounty hunter, anti-mage, puck, ursa, or some other broken class, and the people downstairs who made you run out of hot water are your teammates getting last hits on what would be your kills and turning them into assists on your end. The guy who comes in from downstairs to yell at you is the teammate who, even though you're farming plenty of creeps and earning plenty of gold and experience from them, insists you're killing them ""the wrong way"" and are therefore an idiot noob.The naked shower fight is also a one-way road: once you jump in, there is virtually no returning. You become enslaved and before long all you'll ever want to do for the rest of your life is play dota. You won't even want to talk to or interact with anyone from the outside world unless they are similarly enslaved, by dota (or LoL). The video game world then slowly proceeds to divide and coalesce into two and only two distinct spheres of existence and reality: people who play mobas, and people who don't. Neither side ever so much as glimpses at the other for the remainder of each of its constituents' entire lives because its masochistic addiction level is insane enough to leave Starcraft and WoW in the dust.If you complain about how slippery the surface of the showertub is, people will just yell at you because you're terrible at the game and don't consult the online guidebook and metagame like they do for every minute, individual step taken throughout the game. If you want to get ""good"", you are unequivocally required to follow the instruction book down to the exact letter even if it hardly makes a difference in-game, if at all. If you do otherwise, you will get yelled at. Every single time without exception. To not get yelled at, you have to assimilate into the formless mass. This is all a part of the self-enslavement process: you won't come back, ever.

185,"4,223.5",Not Recommended," February 6, 2017",606,"I've spent 10 years and almost 10,000 hours playing Warcraft III DotA as well as Dota 2, and loved playing it. I've met many interesting people, fought epic battles, snatched victory from the jaws of defeat through several Herculean efforts, endured many soul crushing defeats, and even clashed with a handful of professional players. The game has changed drastically over my many years of playing, but as of about a year ago, the game became too frustrating to continue, and as I continue to watch, I am saddened by what the game has become.For years my friends and I have joked about the ""League-ification"" of Dota. Dota has always been the epitome of hyper competitive cooperative gameplay, with a high emphasis on individual skill and decision making at all phases of the game, especially in punishing poor decisions. Pushing a tower alone with nobody showing on the map? Get back or you're dead. Hard carry dies past 40 minutes without buyback? That's a barracks down. Pick crappy laning heroes? Welcome to hell while the enemy team runs a trilane and pushes barracks at 20 minutes.Our jokes slowly but surely became a reality. Teleport scrolls were reduced in cost, meaning everybody rolled around with a handful because they weren't a financial burden. Ways to gain gold were increased, so supports could afford to have a handful of items in the mid game. The rubber band effect was introduced, and pushing strategies were neutered. You pick a lineup to take towers and take one unfavorable engagement and the game's over, whereas previously the greedier lineup would have to do more work than a single fight to overcome the gold advantage. The cost of boots was reduced, taking boots first strategies from a sure sign that you were bad to a viable strategy. Strong laners also got pushed out. Dominating the early game became effectively irrelevant as killing giant money bag heroes in the midgame would slingshot the trailing team into the lead.The worst casualty has been the versatility of the game. Metas change and stuff goes in and out of favor, that's fine and fair, but certain aspects have become imperative to have. A support with a hard save, a hard carry that can fight in the early mid game. Bad laning heroes can just be sent mid, while traditional skill mid heroes are just sent to the safelane. When you take a big lead, the plan is almost always just farm out the map until you can't possibly lose when taking the high ground, as taking a risk will not just result in you losing a fight, but most likely the lead.The game that I grew up with that punishes the smallest mistakes is a distant memory, and we are left with a mid game brawler. I wish Dota 2 the best as it progresses, but the core mechanics have been changed so drastically that I can neither play nor watch it without feeling like something that was once an unrelenting niche game has been formed to cater to the whims of the massive casual audience that it has attracted."

The program lets me assume the role of another creature, helping me experience our oneness with the universe.I like to assume the position of the dinosaur-riding, lightning-wielding, half-lizard half-man. I like to join servers with up to nine other disciples, be “Disruptor” (as he is called), and go to the jungle, closing my eyes; there I concentrate on my breathing.The other disciples (woefully) always curse at me. I usually have to mute them. I do so to concentrate on being one with the virtual nature. (I can’t afford to go to national parks, so this is the best thing). Sometimes I see lots of colorful exclamations points and these “PING PING PING PING PING” sounds occur around my character. They are beautiful.One time someone said, “THE ♥♥♥♥?! LEVEL 1 DISRUPTOR, BUY COURIER YOU ♥♥♥♥ING RETARD!” And the truth is there are many players like him. They aren’t at peace with themselves. Perhaps if he came into the forest and hummed koans with me, and he had done so as the giant, walking tree, then he would see his greater consciousness. All the negative energy would leave his body, and we’d share a moment of experiencing our Buddha nature.In my experience, sessions last about 10-20 minutes. And initially it did not take long to find a server; apparently I’ve been moved to “low-priority matchmaking.” But that’s okay. I just assume the lotus position in my chair and wait patiently. The only downside to this is that sometimes I forget to click the ""accept"" button."

With the release of How to Train your Dragon 2 (which might've been more suitably named ""How to be a Dictator 2""), Communist influence has been seeded into the minds of the children, destroying the potential for a perfect laissez faire economy for future generations. How to Train your Dragon 2 is a story of a young Shaggy Rogers discovering the wonders of ""Sandwiches"" for the first time with the Rottweiler he owned before Scooby. Our protagonist, a rebellious socialist who never came to grasp the true meaning of Republican Motherhood, is a frequenter of the parks, motivating the homeless by promising them peace and beating them until they promise to get a job or preaching to the innocent picnickers about the evils of animal cruelty. A subtheme of gun control is dished out discreetly as the script writers encourage us to do better than what game theorists think we are capable of with flawed moral consciences. In the same way viewers are assured that we have learned from the days of the arms race by subtly bringing up the Marilyn Monroe-JFK scandal. Obnoxious and unorginal, the production draws content heavily from the movies E.T. and Avatar, indicating that it could have been funded by a collective effort between PETA, James Cameron, the public health institute, Heidi Fleiss, and Joseph Stalin. In the end, the main character's tyrannical liberal-minded father boards a boat to Russia under heavy artillery fire by social darwinists, portrayed as defiant and unruly teenagers that want nothing but an end to civilization. I can say with certainty that any child who watches this film WILL become a democrat at some point in their lives, and, like the movie suggests, the only way to prevent the disease from spreading is to contain it.Oh and Dota 2 is a pretty good game too."

316,"2,690.8",Recommended," November 25, 2013",1,"Dota 2 is a Multiplayer Online Battle Arena, MOBA for short. In Dota 2 is a pure free-to-play game, which means that you don't have to unlock heroes, maps or other stuff. The only way to be good at Dota 2 is to know the game. You need to know every single item and hero to become a really good player. And that's the reason i like this game so much. However, this can be a problem for new players. You don't know anything about the game when you spawn in your base with 4 teammates.So, what is this game all about? Well, you play as one of the 105 available heroes and you have to destroy the enemy base. Sounds easy right? Well, to do that you have to fight your way through towers, creeps and of course the other team.At the start of the game you just stay in your 'lane' and farm and harass enemies by attacking or even ganking them. After this 'laning stage' is completed, your team and the enemy team will face eachother in so called 'teamfights'. After a while, one team will have a large gold and experience advantage, and they will push to the other teams base. And then of course destroy it.Verdict---------I really enjoyed and still enjoy this game. Dota 2 isn't a pay-to-win game, which makes this game much more enjoyable. Dota 2 also has the best eSports support, you can easily watch a match and select one of the several Broadcasters to make watching eSport matches more enjoyable. The only downside of Dota 2 is the fact that you'll need a lot of knowledge to be good at this game.If you manage to survive all the mean teammates and learn everything about the game, you'll easily spend 200 hours on Dota 2. If not, you'll quit within 20 hours.Score: 91/100"

Same hide-spots, same store locations, etc. - though during events sometimes some minor artistic features will be changed).In any case, a simple game as far as setting variety (or lack thereof) goes, but a neat idea. Lots of variation with the heroes, though some are considerably more powerful than others - not the best job balancing them, in my opinion.The problem with Dota 2 is really the community, which is LoL-style atrocious. In all the times I played Dota 2, I met a grand total of 2 friendly people (both in Bot matches). I met a massive number of people who were just downright nasty. Pushy, demanding, immature (not in the fun way), unnecessarily combative. Just unpleasant to work with - not that there ever seemed to be much teamwork in this ""team"" game.I suspect the atrocious community is why steam added the reporting system, but really that just made things worse. The system is frequently abused, leading to players constantly reporting each other for made up things ""just because"", or out of bitterness at losing, or because you don't switch (upon their demand) to speaking Spanish/Russian in the English-language-filtered server, etc.This over-reporting wouldn't be an issue if steam actually followed up to see if the reports had any merit (and maybe removed the reporting option from players who constantly sling false accusations) - but from what I've seen there appears to be no such oversight (hardly surprising - there really is no incentive for valve to follow up).Getting reported kicks you into ""low priority"" matches, which basically means that you have to go up against humans (other players in this awful community) who have also been reported and kicked into low priority. There is a certain number of matches you must play in low priority before you are free to once more play the matches you want (also locks you out of bot matches). There doesn't seem to be any appeals process for this.Oh, you can also get shuttled into low priority for spending ""too long"" without getting experience. So, if you are playing Techies (one of the heroes) and want to go out and spend a few minutes planting mines, the game may just decide that you have ""abandoned"" and kick you into low priority.Anyway, I think I've wasted about enough of my time warning you off.It's a free game (last I checked), so I imagine you'll download and play it anyway. Be my guest. Maybe these things won't bother you :)"

OK my name is etro, who has a hobby of playing a lot of games like skyrim, minecraft,pokemon, and etc. OK here's the point when I played dota 1, the first try of the game was hard and I really can't understand it very much. The moment I played dota 2 , that's how I realize and understands the game so the thing that I'am saying dota2 or valve can explain better than dota 1 (no offense , ice frog) so I would gladly recommend playing dota2 than dota 1 for the first try of the game :).Others say that dota 2 is not a good game or a bad game (well we all have our opinions :) ). For me it's the best game of all the time :D. I respect the Lol (league of legends) players. Even though they are saying that dota 2 sucks. Here in my country (philippines) many Filipinos say that they like Lol better. But I really don't get their point I mean (no offense to the Lol makers and producers) but Lol kinda copied dota 1 ( I don't even know if Lol have their permissions or paid icefrog for copying the main idea of dota) but valve paid icefrog for dota 2 so it means valve have their license while Lol doesn't have. I don't really know guys if Lol really have their permissions or paid icefrog. But I think they didn't ask for permissions or paid ( if im mistaken please correct me or you can just tell me to remove this review. And im sorry if im mistaken that Lol really have their permissions or paid icefrog.but i really think they didnt. Well the real point in this paragraph is I will play or follow the one who have permmisions or paid and that is dota 2 or (valve).If your noob or getting annoyed it's OK cause we all started like noobs :) and just ignore the people who are saying that you're noob,stupid,idiot, they will just annoy you and they have no hearts (they are monsters). Anyway for them to easily ignored just press the heroes panel at the upper left of the screen. In there you can see a speaker's icon then press it and wahhla you muted the player you chossed. I hope this really helped you guys :)OK thank you guys for reading my review with this game. I hope you recommend this :) bye."

312,813.2,Recommended," February 24, 2014",19,"If you can get past the initial learning curve and burden of knowledge the game puts on you, then DOTA2 can be extremely rewarding.As far as most MOBAs are concerned, this one has a good blend of strategy and relfexes that rewards those who can use both to their advantage. The gameplay is, as a result, solid, and every sessions provides new opportunities for fun and strategy.The UI is a little underpopulated, however, and doesn't explain much. learning how to do some of the functional things, like leaving a game that's safe to leave, or muting people, or reporting people, are not super intuitive: you have to dig. Furthermore, the options available, though very powerful and plentiful, are not explained super well. As a result, it's important to toy around with your settings a bit, which can be a hassle.As far as the F2P model goes, it's pretty fair: you can play the whole game without needing any of the micro transactions. The only thing they do is customize your aethetics, and happily not to an extreme extent.Because of this, the game has a really unified look despite all the different items your characters can wear. This might dissuade people from buying them, because some of the items are barely even visible.Overall, I would recommend this game to anyone with a hankering for a challenge. The game is NOT easy, but it is worthwhile and a lot of fun once you get a hang of things. Veterans of the genre will find a lot to like."

Public games are a pure pain 90% of time because of this. I spent most of my 1000+ hours with my friends and even if there was 3 of us, there was still 2 other people on our team who were capable more than enough to ruin the game completely. I am not talking about skill level or gameplay habits but about conduct and morales.Your matches will be repeatedly ruined by idiotic people who can't behave themselves, refuse to cooperate and are not manly enough to admit defeat. No matter how good DOTA is at its core, the time I spent playing such matches was vastly irritating and I am never getting that time back.Here's a list of some pretty standard stuff that you'll be dealing with EVERY. GOD*AMN. MATCH:-very rarely anyone ever commends you for the good plays you manage (that is, if they even notice).-if you screw something up, misclick or miss a spell, it's gonna be pointed out immidiatelly by your team and they will talk sh*t to you and shove it into your face for the rest of the match.-should you ever raise constructive criticism against someone, no matter how kind words you use, that person will most likely not only refuse to learn from it, they will also start to actively look for any tiniest flaws on your side trying to look more pro than you.-there is no such thing as asking for something. People just expect you to do something and then they talk sh*t to you that you didn't do it.-people will constantly blame you for their own mistakes. It will mess with your head even though it's obvious the fault is on their side.-people will start talking sh*t to you out of the blue and refuse to tell you the reason why they're doing it. If they're total fuc*ing idiots, they will just tell you to watch replay.-you will be constantly reminded to uninstall dota.-a teammate will seem completely oblivous to your attempts to communicate with them but will gladly say ""noob"" when you comment on the fact that they don't cooperate.-if you're just having a bad day and your performance is outright bad, your whole team will start a f*cking crusade against you. They will start talking the enemy team into reporting you and they will very likely sabotage your gameplay in various ways.-at a certain point when victory seems too far, some of these ret*rds just have a breakdown and will remain afk and just move occassionally to not be auto-kicked by the game, effectively ruining the match and wasting time of anyone on their team who actually wants to play.-if there is no one specific to blame for losing, they will just throw it on the person with the lowest K/D. Preferably a healer support hero who rarely gets any kills at all.This list is just a tip of the iceberg. I am constantly losing faith in humanity because of people in this game. If you ever meet someone who doesn't qualify for this list, send them a big hug from me, because it's those people who keep me playing somehow.With this in mind, I cannot possibly encourage you to have your precious time ruined by terrible cowardly people who don't understand that griefing and destructive criticisim aren't helping anything and can only make matters worse."
143,"1,687.5",Not Recommended," June 14, 2015",34,"I've played this game since it was a WarcraftIII mod, and I have to say, it's one of the best games I've ever played {mechanics wise}. However, it has more than it's fair share of problems.For starters, this game has a stupidly high learning curve. There's no one true way to play any of the 100+ heroes, and it can get very frustrating very fast trying to find what you can easily work with for any of them with the gigantic selection of items. Even all these years later, theres still only a small pool of heroes that I'm confident enough with to pick on a regular basis, while the rest of the roster is more or less alien to me, with my success {or lack thereof, which is normally the case} depending largely on the skill level of the enemy team and my teammates. Which brings us to the next point.90% of the people who play this game don’t need to be playing this game. Now, I'm by far not the best at this game. I'm slightly above average at best. However, it's hard to improve myself, or even play on anything outside of solo bot servers when I'm constantly thrown in with stupid people, first timers, people who don't speak the server regions language, people who are only there to prance around in costumes, or don't want to follow simple orders/use common sense, or any combination of the above. Meanwhile, I can rest assured that my opponents will almost always have their act together, and be an unstoppable force that I desperatly try to at least slow down. Which is made even harder when my teammates insist on throwing themselves into unwinnable battles, further feeding the enemy until the point where there's a 5+ level gap between me and the lowest leveled enemy. On the other hand, I might go up against a team that's super bad. In which case, I've learned nothing, and my time is wasted just as thoroughly as it would be against people out of my league. Or, on the {insanely rare} occasion that I get teammates that know what they're doing, I can expect them to whine about my choice of hero, my starting items/abilities, my lane choice, or god forbid, my costume. At which point, most of these people will purposefully feed the enemy or go afk, and then either rage quit or spend the rest of the match trolling and flaming. Or they might report me to try and get me thrown into low priority, which is Dota's equivalent of hell. And unlike most other multiplayer games, theres no dropping out whenever you wish without taking a heavy penalty for doing so. So have fun being in matches where there will be almost no fun a majority of the time.Now, there is a report system, which in theory, is supposed to shoo away the people that don't need to be playing this in the first place. In practice, it's horribly broken, due to being automated. Doing amazingly well, but you're the odd man out in a Peruvian 4 stack that you've somehow managed to offend? Expect to have the low priority message pop up when you exit to the menu after the match. Maybe you want to report your support who refused to place wards, started feeding, and ended up with a score of 0/25? The entire server could report them, but they could still easily slip through without getting lp. In all seriousness, it's down to luck if it does work when it's needed, and doesn't when it's being abused.Up next, hero balance. Thankfully, this isn't quite as bad as it could be, but there is still silliness here and there. Some heroes have one or two overpowered abilities, while others are all around unbalanced, and others still are in sore need of buffing. Some are literally useless outside of certain situations {Nyx Assassin requiring the enemy to have supports/squishy heroes to operate}, while others are universally helpful {Crystal Maiden's aura always being a big help}. At the same time, some heroes are nicely balanced, but are easily outclassed by other heroes who can perform the same role, only much better and easier. Why pick Legion Commander and eventually out damage the enemy team using skill, when you can pick Ursa and out damage them from level 3 onwards with only a single keystroke? Why pick Weaver and alternate between your 2 escapes when you can pick Storm Spirit and have an escape with no cooldown? Why pick Centaur Warrunner to be durable when you can pick Axe and be so tanky that the lane gets locked down for your enemy? There's tons of examples like this. You'll also see some heroes almost every match, {Pudge, Sniper, Zeus, who all have skills that can be more or less mindlessly spammed/have low risk high reward play styles} but many are seen rarely outside of higher tier comp play {Io, Meepo, Dark Seer, who all take some degree of skill/have high risk decent reward play styles}. And none of it is helped by Valve making nonsensical buffs and nerfs, almost all of which are based on tournaments, what with them either hammering heroes that are frequently picked/do really well, and overly buffing heroes that aren't picked often to encourage picking them.As with TF2, Valve has turned this game into another hat simulator. I played a ton of the original Dota, and I sure don't remember any customization, because that would have been silly. This game is hard enough without your idiot teammates being distracted by someone's super pimped out loadout, or worrying about getting a nice drop {if any, only 2-3 people usually get drops at the end of the round}. The main problem with character customization though, is that much like TF2, it attracts jerks that only want to play the super easy characters and dress them up, then look down on everyone else who isn't wearing a 20c wolf hat, regardless of how good or bad they're doing. Yeah, take your little wolf hat into a ranked match, and see how they like it. Also like TF2, Valve focuses more on cosmetic items than the actual gameplay itself, which started off small, but in recent months has led to them:1. In a game with very few official modes, canceling popular seasonal modes, in order to {in their own words} 'focus more on cosmetic sets'.2. Building entire game modes around expensive sets {although in fairness, said sets only tracked stats for the events in question, but still...}, or just flat out making new modes pay to win {the Year Beast Brawl was p2w to the point that disgusting amounts of money and cheap tactics trumped genuine skill almost every match}.3. Doing inane things like changing the perfectly fine models of heroes, and then using that as an excuse to make more money {Shadow Fiend's model was just fine, but then he got a redesign that looked like an angsty 12 year old made it, and a $35 cosmetic that looked like an even more angsty 10 year old designed it}.4. Possibly the worst, outright ignoring critical server issues to focus on cosmetic item bugs {also during the YBB, Valve ignored their own failing servers that were crashing every 10 or so minutes, and instead focused all of their efforts on making sure Crystal Maiden's hair didn't despawn while she was wearing her new $35 outfit. No, really, word for word, the lone note in that patch was ""Fixed a rare, yet extremely common, embarrassing hair problem for Crystal Maiden""}.Overall, the game would be greatly improved if Valve would do the following things:1. Mandatory region locking for everyone, to heavily cut down on the language barrier.2. Making the tutorial required for new players.3. Restricting pvp until profile level 5, and ranked matches until at least 20, both to make it harder for new players to come in with zero idea of how to play in a live match, and to make it harder on smurfers who only live to troll ranked.4. Making the game pay to play again, which would encourage people to actually care about doing good/not have 20+ alt accounts for trolling and smurfing.As fun as this game is, I reccomend it to no one, other than someone willing to go through absolute misery to occasionally have fun."

As an over-30-year-old gamer with kids of my own, perhaps I'm just too old for this. Anyway, thumbs down. NEXT.EDIT: my 9-year-old just found out ""Dota 2"" is a thing (thanks, loud-mouthed fourth graders.) So +1 for ""Dota 2"" because it's one pc game my kids and I can play together and not worry about off-color game content (as long as we play with bots and not foul-mouthed angry nerds.)Looks like I *might* be re-installing....... SIGH.... As they say in Vegas, the House always wins. Well played, Valve, well played."
219,"2,088.3",Not Recommended," May 6, 2016",151,"This is a game with potential, genuinely good qualities, but it has severe issues.DOTA 2 requires teamwork to win, but it is filled with incompetent & abusive players. To make matters worse, matchmaking results are not balanced. One team often has better players than the other right from the start.Neither of these issues would be severe, if not for a punishment system which forces you to remain in 60-90 minute matches that are unbalanced & abusive. Despite the game having two modes, ranked & unranked, and the latter being described as casual, both are virtually the same.I have advocated that if unranked is indeed meant to be the ""casual"" mode of DOTA 2, then the punishment system for inactivity & abandoning, should not apply here.After remaining in a miserable 60-90 minute match to avoid an abandon & subsequent low priority, you may still get reported by abusive players. In DOTA 2 it isn't uncommon for a player to blame you for their own mistakes & then report you. Example, seen people solo tower diving or jungling alone in the enemies territory & as soon as they die they blame everyone else. The time when you're most likely to receive a fraduluent report is when your team has a party of 3 or 4 people, and you're the outsider; in this case, the abuser won't want to blame their friends so it is easier to blame the stranger. So point of this paragraph is to highlight that remaining in a bad match, doesn't always save you from the punishment system & it highlights that there is nothing ""casual"" about unranked as a result.The only casual DOTA 2, is modded DOTA 2. Unfortunately most of the servers for that are in Peru & run like♥♥♥♥♥♥This is a free game, so there isn't much risk in trying it, but there are other games in this genre that don't force you to endure unfair or abusive 60-90 minute matches, so I'd recommend you try those first."

35,"3,431.6",Not Recommended," December 13, 2016",13,"New Edit at 30.12.2017After changes during 7.00-> onward the game did come out of the issues previously stated. However, theres still some major issues that has and never will apparently be addressed properly:1. Alt / Smurf / Troll / etc. accounts. Even after the ""add your phone"" system, there has been no change in the amount of clear alt and troll accounts. On the contrary: after Turbo mode was introduced it seems the old ranked mode is even more filled with people who should just be permanently banned.2. Scripters: Issue that is not widely screamed about, but is there. On this issue I have no idea how well Valve is hunting them down and how common it really is. What I do know, is that you sometimes stumble on players abusing scripts and the only way to really know is to watch and analyze the replay.3. Overall toxic behavior that will never disappear as long as alt accounts are possible. There are just so many players that aren't just abusive in chat. They intentionally destroy games for the entire team. Didn't get mid? well, i'll just sit in base and get 100 xp every 5 mins from jungle and then sit in base watching youtube again. Or I'll just buy all wards and place them in our fountain because of reason x.4. After the talent introduction I feel the game has gone in a downward spiral in terms of balance. There has never been so clear meta than after 7.00. Every patch there are heroes with insane winrates on all mmr ranges.-------------------------------I have to say that I'v always thought Dota as the best MOBA out there in terms of gameplay and the insanely high skill cap. A much of that remains now that 7.00 came out, but in the mean while the GUI is♥♥♥♥♥♥♥to the point that the game doesn't feel right anymore.However, the issue isnt only the GUI. A major issue is the new map imo. Suddenly the map became a super open world that doesn't have the same boundries it used to have. Theres just way too many ways to invade opposing side of the map making the world feel like its an open arena instead of radiant and dire side.I have to say that my first impressions on the new patch is leaving me with the feeling that I don't wanna play dota2 anymore at all.Edit: 7th of Feb 2017After some UI fixes the game has started to look like Dota again. However, during these new updates things have gone in other ways a lot worse.After some changes to the match making system and report system, there has been a significant raise in unjustified low priority games. You can get low priority for anything now. Example: Muted after 3 games of summary showing 0-3. Didn't say a word during those games, won 1, lost 2. After which a 4 game winstreak (still muted) and receive 3 games in low priority.Problem is that opponents are able to report you. If you play certain heroes you will farm reports like theres no tomorrow. I kinda have to say, Im starting to feel im finally done with this game for good and won't put any more money into it."

90,"5,309.5",Recommended," December 9, 2011",13,"2016:After 5 years of Dota 2, all the heroes are finally released and the next newest hero, Monkey King is coming out in December this year.Dota 2 has become a spectator sport in the footsteps of traditional sports such as Basketball and Football, in the sense that they are all team-oriented games and require strategy to win.Through the recent gameplay patches of 6.87 and 6.88, there have been many new changes that focuses more on the strategic aspects of the game, namely Scans and cheaper more defensive items.New items such as Echo Sabre and Hurricane Pike also serve to make competitive games more exciting as teams that have fallen behind in the early game now have a chance to comeback with the cheaper mid-tier but very cost-efficient items giving them an opportunity to fight back.""Everything can work""As a whole, Dota 2 has become a game very much focused on positioning and the right draft composition of heroes for the game match at hand.No particular strategy has dominated the tournament scene this year, be it push, defensive splitpush, or teamfight, and it is this remarkable balance that allows many teams with varied style tendencies to showcase their way of playing without feeling disadvantaged. Be it EG's methodical lane dominance and calm style, MVP Phoenix's all-in teamfight style, EHOME's strategic drafting style, or TI6 Winners - Wings' anything goes style.Valve has also shown interest in further expanding the game through its released custom games feature for Dota 2 and Virtual Reality support for spectating.Overall, its been a good year for Dota 2, the game is more fun than ever with any strategy being workable, all heroes being viable in competitive tournaments and more expanded options for spectating, viewing games and analysing replays and statistics that aficionados would love.Over the course of a year, Dota 2 has slowly introduced its Source 2 game client, which allows for easier integration of custom games similar to the original system of Warcraft 3's . The International 2015 tournament is also a huge success and has a record $18.4 million, of which $16.8 million were contributed by community spending. Valve has also revealed its future plans for the game in the form of quarterly Majors tournaments that is meant to further develop its competitive scene and community interest.It is also clear that Dota 2 will be taking a seasonal games events approach towards stimulating community support, with obvious targets being December Holidays, Chinese New Year and Halloween.With regards to porting over Dota 1's legacy, there are only 2 heroes left: Arc Warden and Pitlord; and they are likely to be introduced with the aforementioned games events.At this point, the longevity of Dota 2 is very much secured in the foreseeable future due to Valve's Steam Client storefront, massive player base and successful implementation of cosmetic item sales that do not affect gameplay.Icefrog, you did the right thing by choosing to work with Valve for Dota 2's future back in 2010. I hope that you continue to work on your legacy and enjoy the feelings of joy, happiness, rage, sadness and comradery that you have brought to millions of people worldwide.Dota 2 just keeps improving over time. At the rate this game is progressing, it is likely that it will still be around 5-10 years later. The community keeps expanding and the content updates are constant and full of exciting new features. Seasonal events bring about new quests and co-op gameplay that make good use of the core game's heroes' abilities. The cosmetic items economy is healthy and ever booming with more and more workshop artists contributing. As a competitive game oriented towards esports, Dota 2's professional scene has certainly expanded exponentially and The International's prizepool over the years can be seen as an indicator. It has grown exponentially from $1.6 million in 2012, to $2.9 million in 2013 and is projected to hit $10 million in 2014.Dota 2 has also recently implemented Ranked Matchmaking, which allows players the opportunity to play games for an ELO-style rating. While it has exploits and flaws at its debut, the subsequent updates over time have vastly improved the experience. It is a welcome new feature and it enables players interested in a more competitive experience to play to their best abilities, knowing that their teammates and opponents will likely put in the same amount of effort.Valve Inc. has proven that they will continue to support Dota 2 in all aspects and maintain a healthy esports scene. The game caters to all spectrums of players, be it casual, competitive or spectator.Matchmaking system still has its design flaws and the game still lacks a way to convey to competitive players their skill level and standings/ratings.Dota 2 requires huge player investment, but provides magnificent and immeasurable rewards for commitment.Now free to play! All heroes are free and available. Items are available for purchase for each individual hero, they do not affect the game balance at all as they are purely cosmetic, and the colors and items fit Dota 2's medieval setting.This is a game for the competitive PC gamers. DOTA 2, the sequel to DotA features better character animations, mechanics, graphics and interface design. The ease of matchmaking, connecting with your friends and playing a cooperative team game all culminate together to make DOTA 2 a complete game experience. No two games are the same and despite this game still being in beta, it is already a great experience akin to other AAA PC games out there.This game is a definite buy for me. What will it be for you?"

The best part of this game is that its not pay to win, all the items that you can get only alters your look in some way and not your performance in the game so no matter what weapon you are using. Be it vanilla or $10 weapon for a hero, it will do same damage to the opponent in all cases. I for one don't care much about Hero looks so its a big plus for me.All in all a very good and polished game. It also updates very frequently which is good and bad depending on your bandwidth.Must play for sure. :)"

This is an addiction which reduces your productivity, attention span, and free-time. You are becoming more bitter, narrow-minded, haughty, and old. Quit now and delete this game. There is nothing here but slow, lonely suicide.People do not have fun here. Players do not communicate succesfully with one another, they nitpick mistakes with witty remarks and mock each other. Nobody is interested in the truth; people are battling for fleeting moments of superiority. Players are loud jackasses who tumble into one argument after another, anxiously waiting for you to respond to ensure they keep the last word every time. A fair and balanced match is one in ten thousand, and no matter how hard you filter those matchmaking options you are still searching for diamonds in a garbage dump.This game is not making you happy. You are not having fun. You are not gathering fun experiences to tell, learning, or growing as a person.

After politely asking foreigners to speak english while on US West servers, they respond with reports, death threats and various other verbal abuses.

I have a second account devoted to it, where my playtime is similar, and I haven't gotten anywhere close to 2000+ hours in any other video game.But I can't recommend it to a new player, for a single very significant reason.The community is the single most toxic community I have ever been a part of. It is extremely, extremely rare for a match to be completely free of players abusing you for bad decisions and shouting at you over a microphone in a language you can't even understand. For me, it's become comical, but for a new player, unless they have friends that are willing to teach them the basics and help them learn the mechanics of the game, they are going to struggle. There are tutorials, but these are beyond limited, and with a pool of 113 Heroes each with individual and unique abilities, the learning curve is exceptionally steep. In order to be a ''good'' player, every detail of every single skill and item in the game will need to be learned (that is, its function, cooldown, damage, added effects, gold cost, mana cost, and more.) This takes several hours to achieve. The best way of learning all these intricate details would usually be to just play the game, but the aforementioned toxic community makes this impossible unless you have a number of friends willing to play alongside you while you learn the basics.Now, let's assume you have a group of four friends, or you are lucky enough to be matched with reasonable and understanding players. Let's assume that you've put the time into learning the mechanics of the game.You're going to have a great time. The game is, with a few glaring exceptions, well balanced and fair at all times, putting the outcome of each and every game at least largely down to the player's skill and their ability to communicate with their team. It is completely and utterly free to play, there are no extra heroes or stat bonuses that can be bought, although there are cosmetic item sets and other miscellaneous items such as different soundtracks and HUDs that can be bought with real money, but these are entirely optional. This means that every player has access to the same number of heroes, and on top of that Heroes are not cycled like in other MOBAs- all 113 heroes are available all the time. The sheer amount of playtime that this game offers is mindblowing, especially taking the fact that it is free into consideration. I can't think of any other game, free or otherwise, that could remain so fresh and enjoyable for so long. There are so many different playstyles and so many different incredible hero combinations that can be utilised, the cliché that 'no two games are the same' definitely applies here.On top of all this, it's excellently optimised- most systems will be able to run it at a semi-decent framerate.The terrible community and the natural learning curve that comes with the MOBA genre really are a shame, because this game really is a true achievement of video gaming. Its a 10/10 game without a doubt but it's near impossible to get into, and it is that very factor that means, in the vast majority of cases, this game cannot be recommended."

True you will enjoy it till your life is dominated by abusive players, racist players, feeders and trolls. I have never seen a game where a player just jump right inb and his paired with way more experienced players and doesnt even know what his ultimate power does, if it was just that it would have being fine but no you have to deal with racists and bigots that harass you because of who you are. I cannot count how many times my religion has made someone follow me about and call me names till I disconnected from the game because the harassment was too much, and guess what valve punished me for leaving a game where I was being harassed. VALVE supports racists and trolls. Don't even get me started on the Ranked system that is no different that littered with cheaters and toxic elements, it is also rigged to benefit their so-called PRO PLAYERS.

I've come to the conclusion that yes, the gameplay is fun, it can be fun with friends, and it is rewarding sometimes, I highly do not recommend it to new people. The community is 16 shades of toxic, the report system is, the best I can describe it, extremely useless, as well, it just shows a total lack of effort from Valve, and their lack of effort to improve the community. One person on your team feeding and raging? Oh well, unless people from another game report him, he's probably not getting low priority. If you play more than one match of Dota a day, you'll probably run out of the allotted weekly reports (3) rather quickly, and the only way to get more within the week is if they act upon the person you report. I've had multiple games with people feeding, spam pinging, or being toxic as hell in general. Whole team reports them, nothing happens. The report was wasted and it feels like a suggestion box connected directly to a trash can. The low priority system just needs to be completely redone. The whole thing is ineffectual, and usually ends up being one maybe two people in the game who got low priority because of Internet problems (I've suffered from quite a few of these and thus my knowledge of the hell that is low priority), while the rest are ragers, spam pingers, and feeders. Yes Dota has very intellegent gameplay, and tons of depth and can be hours and hours of replayable fun, however, with the community how it is, the terrible punishment/report system, and valve's total lack in interest to fix any problems that aren't related to making money, I have to recommend you not download Dota 2"

In Dota 2, players in teams of five control various heroes and abilities in a bid to utterly crush the enemy in a pointless waste of 30-60 minutes.* GameplayDota 2 largely follows the experience of the original Dota All Stars mod: you pick a hero of your choice and get assigned to the Radiant or Dire (formerly known as Sentinel and Scourge) faction with the objective of destroying the enemy's Ancient. Protecting the Ancients is maintained by towers and barracks which ensure lane equilibrium and creep strength. Heroes are initially very weak and must rely on creeps (faceless grunts) to obtain starting gold from which options to start pushing begin, as well as experience which enables leveling up abilities. Abilities range from:Deal damage (and maybe a status effect)Inflict a positive or negative buffArea of effect damage/positive or negative buffUtilitiesGlobal effectsWhile laning is the main way to gain gold and experience, alternate choices are fighting neutral creeps in the jungle (usually done by very specific heroes) or challenging the mighty Roshan, who drops the fabled Aegis of the Immortal (resurrect on death). In order to maintain the advantage, certain nuances of the game must be learned:Of course, having a good Dota 2 experience is defined by your teammates, who may be either incompetent or singlehandedly taking on the entire enemy team and winning. Communication and teamwork are vital, thus it is recommended to play with friends, although it doesn't ensure victory.* Hero roles and balanceEach hero has a set of 4 abilities that have synergy with each other or other heroes' abilities, but more importantly, each has a specific role:A hero is not forced to follow a role, although using highly unorthodox tactics will most likely earn you the scorn of your team, possibly giving you a trip to the low priority queue, filled with Russians and similar people. Dota 2 often changes with large updates that give heroes buffs or nerfs, change certain mechanics or simply iron out bugs and glitches. The most popular heroes tend to be the ones that have an easy way of dominating games, making you have a hard time if they aren't on your team, although learning to counter them is a great learning experience.* Other interests in Dota 2If you get bored (and you will) of right clicking at the time, the game offers the option of following various e-sport leagues, the biggest being the yearly International hosted by Valve, and famous players (such as Dendi, EternaLEnVy and so on) which set many gameplay trends and strategies. There is also the large economy which is mostly based on altering the looks of heroes and the game, but with no pay-to-win options, except maybe gaudy gold cosmetics. Finally, every Chinese New Year/Halloween/Christmas a slightly different game mode is introduced, thus making the game slightly less stale.* Closing commentsDota 2 is a fairly well made game which offers many hours of play, although the relatively unchanging experience and hostile people may spoil your enjoyment. Personally, I wouldn't suggest getting too involved as you will become highly misanthropic, although I wouldn't say it is a bad game."

And even that was achieved by being a dota nerd, watching guides, theorycrafting 24/7 while eating or sitting on the toilet or traveling or trying to sleep. It becomes an obsession, a challenge to learn the entire game. Only to unlearn and relearn everything again every major patch. It's more mind straining than getting an academic education or even trying to get a PHD. I never thought of the game as worth the effort and time investment.So why keep playing if one thinks it just isn't worth the time investment? At first it was the damn human curiosity, experimenting every detail and enjoying the results. But after that phase 2 main reasons remained: too much free time and not having another game to play. Mainly it was the latter reason. Me and my friends would find some games, play them until we were bored, find singleplayer games, finish them, aand then there was nothing to do. So no other game? Back to dota. I hated this vicious circle.I tried to quit atleast 15 times, deleted the game several times while I had a really poor download speed, tried quitting by removing my monitor from the house, changed the pw of my only account in windows to something really long and gave it away to somebody so I couldn't open the computer, deleted steam entirely several times and tried much, much more things to quit. I couldn't. Stuck in the loop, I kept trying to improve my gameplay by watching high level players play and explain the game.Until one day...I came across ChiLongQua's youtube channel...The first video I saw, he was non-stop feeding the enemy team, while complaining about the issues in the game such as:-im 5k yet i always get matched with 4k ♥♥♥♥♥tains that don't know how to play the game, you have to forcefully tell them on mic what to do-last game my teammate gave up and fed for a puny argument and if my game gets ruined, im gonna ruin someone elses gameMy first thought was: ""Huh, an annoying tryhard rager kid that flames everyone on voice chat just because he lost some games"". But the more I watched, the more I understood his psychology and his reasoning behind his actions. It is a long story but in the end I eventually decided to feed like him just to understand his mentality even more.

First, I realized how♥♥♥♥♥♥ and inefficient the enemy team was at killing me. I ran around under their tower and they still struggled to kill me. This alone made me realize the enemy team is way worse than I am at the game. My teammates reacted to the situation like expected. But in the sentences they produced I was able to understand they are simply stupid. The results were amazing. I was enlightened.After this feeding session, I played my next game normally(while still thinking in my mind that I am the best player in the game) and I stomped that game. I stomped the next game after that. This was weird. Because I had been stuck at that my mmr for years. But the change of my mindset gained me 600 mmr in less than 10 days. Realizing that I will almost always have to carry my team if I want to win, I will always have inferior players to me in my team and the enemy team, I was able to slowly stop playing dota. I realized the game as a whole was a pile of mess, that cant be fixed, if you dont fix the players. So my hatred for dota grew day by day, and one day I deleted the game for the last time. It has been over 2 years since I last played dota. The hatred kindling, kindled by CLQ grew so big that I was able to finally quit. CLQ had saved me.Later I played dota again with my friends once several months when new big patches came. But I wasnt getting addicted anymore. I was able to enjoy the game with my friends again.This game is a vacuum that will suck your life and soul in. There is no ending to this game.

Dota 2 is a psychiatric hospital that doesn't fix people, it only makes them worse.I certainly don't regret any of my playtime I have on this game. But I am glad I dont have any more hours than what I had currently spent on it. If it wasn't for CLQ and the enlightenment he provided me, I would have sunk about 5k hours into this game by now. (Sadly, he is still playing dota forcing himself to be positive and not rage. He defies his own past, defies his own opinions. Just because youtube is an income for him. His position is just sad.)With that many hours, you can master any craft, study anything to become one of the best at the subject. But if you sink 5k hours into dota, you will still be an above average player. If you don't go pro, you get nothing in return. Stop lying to yourself. You aren't having fun playing this game. It became a stressful work a long time ago. Think about it.If you don't agree with anything I said, just go ruin a game, purposefully feed and analyze the other players reactions. One game won't hurt. Then think about all of the above, again.If you are already a high skilled but non pro player with your teenage years buried into this game, think about other games you couldve spent a fraction of time on and became one of the top players, earning all that e-sports money you can't get playing dota 2. Since you never actually played any other game while not thinking about dota in the back of your head, you are unable to comprehend that there are other fun games out there, that don't require wasting 10 years of your 70 year life to learn.03.05.2017Ahmet Faruk Albayrak"

You'll get flamed, shamed and pressured into renewing a subscription just so you can validate yourself as a dota player.Valve understands its toxic community, I have no doubt they're trying to leverage the harassment that will surely ensue in pubs whether you don't have a pass or didn't renew it.Why do I need to pay to validate to others that I am a good dota player?All of these new ""features"" could have easily come standard to everyone.All of this plus, I can see a future now where they'll lock further and further content behind this paywall.

300,88.6,Not Recommended," October 24, 2014",267,"At first, I thought this game was pretty good, but that was until the first time I was called a ""feeder"".Dota 2 is basically a game based around teamwork, except most of the players only do three things:1. Call each other f*gs and berate one another for slightly unwise decisions.2. Do solo farm and try to carry the match all by themselves (which never works).3. Ruin the game for new players.If you want to learn how to play Dota, you either need a really good guide or a good friend who has a few hundred hours with the game. The tutorial only explains to you the baby-♥♥♥ basics. Learning how to play by matchmaking with randos is a horrible experience, all you'll learn from the other players is that you suck because you're new and you don't understand the game and that the best course of action would be to uninstall. It doesn't help that the game has a skyscraper for a learning curve and smurfing is still very much alive and well in this toxic community.The worst thing is that this game stole all my friends back when we first started playing. One of them had a serious problem with the game for a few years until recently. He spent approximately $300 on Dota 2 cosmetics, and he's not the only one. There are thousands of young, naive players spending dozens, if not hundreds, of dollars on cosmetic items, thanks to Valve's efficient tactics and the fact that they don't do anything about scammers or people in the community trying to rip others off even more.All in all, this game is just jampacked with toxicity, from its community, to the gameplay, to Valve's business practices.EDIT: 172 people agreed with this review. Wow.A fun fact for you: The tutorials have more maps than the actual game, which has just one map. I know this is pretty standard for MOBA games, but for me, this contributes greatly to ruining fun and variety. It's just all the same tactics over and over on the same map. This doesn't only mean less excitement, but it also means that veterans will know the game just that much better, adding further to the insane learning curve.On another note, this game is pretty much the opposite of everything I like about TF2.Unbalanced classes (According to Google, every Dota hero/champion/class/whatever the hell is overpowered), only A SINGLE MAP, relies too much on teamwork when it's hard to find online (TF2 benefits from teamwork, but it's not required. It's also much easier to actually achieve teamwork because TF2 doesn't rely NEARLY as much on your early-game. The early-game in Dota literally either makes or breaks the whole game for you, setting the outcome of the match in stone literally during the first ten minutes of the game.), and also, a horrible community. I'm not saying TF2's community is good, but hell, it's miles above Dota.I don't really know why I'm comparing this game to TF2. Maybe because Valve made both games? Still, just wanted to share some actual criticism about the game itself and not the community.One guy in the comments told me ""Pfft, just block the trash talkers"". That doesn't change anything. They're still horrible at teamwork, which, like I said, is the entire point of the game. And if you block them, you can't coordinate with them. It's not only a bad game for new players because you suck, it's also a bad game for new players because everyone else sucks. Except for Koreans, whenever you see one in a game, bam, his team has won.Overall, I think Dota has great potential, but it's just too bad that the game will most likely never actually achieve to fulfill it.EDIT 2: I just came back to this game and tried it out again the hopes that maybe SOMETHING about it has gotten better.No.There's still absolutely no communication between the players except for casual pings here and there. That's not helpful at all.There are tons of balancing issues in the game, and the one character that stands out the most is Sniper. He has good abilities and does really high damage at a really fast rate at a really long distance if you play the game right. He can easily annihilate two to three heroes by himself in the late-game. Frankly, he is cheap, and he was almost practically made to steal kills (something I'll be addressing a bit later). Valve is a company structured in a way that, if you're an employee, you don't really NEED to do these things. You don't NEED to patch bugs. You don't NEED to fix balancing issues. At Valve, the employees' primary concern is getting recognition. If you add something that looks cool, you're gonna get recognition. If you're going to fix something, you're not, because you're not showing off your creativity or imagination. You're doing an important job to ensure that the product works as intended. No-one at Valve cares for that, they need more hats.Let's go back to the kill stealing. When fighting any enemy or neutral, you get much more experience and gold, as well as the kill credit, if you actually deliver the killing blow. Yep, just the last hit, no questions asked. It doesn't matter if you've reduced someone from full to 1% health and someone from your team pops out of nowhere to take the kill credit and leave you with a measly amount of gold and experience. A lot of players hate these kill thieves, but you know what? That's exactly what this game encourages. To screw other players over. Couldn't, say, the gold and experience be divided between the two players based on the damage they did? Nope. Instead, the players are forced to naturally hate each other. If you are an actually fair player who doesn't want to rely on these cheap tactics, you'll be behind in the game. What is this, Defense of the Capitalists?I previously mentioned that one friend spent $40 on cosmetics in DOTA 2. I actually played this game with him again, and he has spent about, well... $300 on the game. That's enough to buy 4 copies of GTA V here in Australia. He was also recently hacked and had $200 worth of cosmetics stolen from him. That's what you get when you purchase blatantly overpriced virtual trash that does not affect you in any way.Probably one of the absolutely worst parts of the game, and also the big reason as to why it steals lives, are the long matches. Matches usually take anywhere between 30 to 50 minutes. The longest I've seen is 70 minutes. You're not going to have time to go to the toilet (I bet Valve is in cahoots with adult diaper manufacturers), you're not going to have time to eat, you're not going to have time to speak to people while playing the game or do little chores around the house that your parents need you to do because they're incredibly impatient, and if you're going to get addicted to the game, like most of its players, you're not going to have time to have a life. See: my Russian cousin.The biggest thing I hate (for real) is that when your early-game sucks, you're going to be stuck in a losing match where you know you've lost and all your team is doing is delaying the inevitable. Losing feels horrible, and if you quit at this point, THE CONSEQUENCES WILL NEVER BE THE SAME!!! LITERALLY!!! The more you abandon games (doesn't matter if the game crashes on you or if you have a slow internet connection and the entire thing stopped working or if you have a really slow connection and it messes up and boots you out of the game or if you have a slow computer, like my $300 friend, and your entire computer crashes and you can't get back in the game), the more you will be punished. So, on your first few abandons, you will get a few low priority matchmaking games (low priority games are pretty much like the normal priority games ON STEROIDS! So, more insults, less teamwork, more nasty guys, more kill steals). Then, as you keep abandoning games, the punishment gets more severe each time. The number of low priority games you get for abandoning never goes down.This is the final edit. I have pretty much run out of charac"

151,"2,442.9",Not Recommended," September 22, 2016",683,"Don't do it! Walk away from this game now. This game is meth, rotting teeth and all.What you THINK this game is: 5 players working together to win, using various tactics and communication. You've seen some pro player highlights maybe, and you want to be in that mix of battle.What this game really IS: angry gamers that are addicted to this broken game, and want to make your life suck. Don't believe me? Look at the ""new player"" summary, the DEVs have literally locked new players away from the toxic trash that inhabits this game. If you're still not sure, the DEVs have made it that your first 25 games, you are only matched with players with ""consistently high behavior ratings."" So, 1% of the population. Who you will never hear from again once off your 25 game ""training"". They also keep you away from the stupid ""carry"" set up they have going. A ""carry"" is a hero that can 1v5 the enemy after 50 minutes of farming non-stop without fighting almost at all. So you might be rumbling in lane all match, inching up those kills and pushing the lanes... then 50 minutes clicks over and here comes their carry. Let's assume your carry isn't ready or just sucks. This is the internet, so 100% that person is on your team, despite randomness. So your slow, grudging win that you were 10 minutes away from? Now that carry kills your whole team by themselves, without ever needing help. Ooops! And now they've destroyed your base.And that doesn't cover the cowardly, who don't know that they're cowardly. It might be you! They stand in the background of fights, holding their heavy-hitting ability ready, waiting for the enemy to get low HP so they can swoop in to kill. It's satisfying! But it also means the 5v5 fight is really 4v5 b/c someone is not participating. Usually the 5 man team will win out, and the coward in the back? They start running--too late! The enemy has gap closers and run them down, killing them also. Like I said, these players don't even know they're doing it. They're thinking ""why couldn't my team do a better job and wear the enemy down so I could finish them off?!""People will rage. They will die purposefully to throw the game (""feed""). They don't speak English and are angry about that for some reason. You CANNOT LEAVE the game during an hour long match. And it is an hour long. Every time.So what you think you are getting into is a well-organized battle game, like a highly-trained football team out there on the field; what you are really getting into is an unsupervised playground for little kids. There is screaming, bullying, someone pushing someone off the slide, someone throwing pine cones at his friends, a weird kid staring off into space.Why people play this game? Becuase we're idiots and think ""next game, I'll have a good team."" and ""I screwed up that build, I'll try again!"" Or maybe ""I need a new hero, that one sucked!""And you cannot change this outcome by yourself. No matter what you do. Your team wins when they are selfless and work to let the carry farm mindlessly all match. You lose because someone (or everyone) on your team was selfish or just angry at the world (take a guess how many people that is on the internet...).This is an hour long game. You CANNOT leave. The trolls and jerks usually start screaming or typing insults by 4 minutes into this. You CANNOT leave. The guy that doesn't speak English is now mad because people are calling him names he vaguely recognizes, so he starts feeding on purpose for the rest of the hour long game. You CANNOT leave. The opposing team realizes that you have the team that is falling apart faster than theirs, so they start typing ""NOOBS"" and ""EZ!"" in all caps every 2 minutes as they kill you repeatedly. And as they kill you, they get more gold, more xp, and the process steamrolls to the point where you cannot make a comeback by the 30 minute mark... the loss is complete... after the full hour (the winning team doesn't want to end early, they're enjoying their fleshed out heroes destroying yours). You CANNOT leave.Walk the f**** away and send me a Xmas card as a thank you."

Two of which are splitting the community and hurting matchmaking.For starters they've recently added a subscription option, which puts some player assisting features behind a paywall that is inching the game more towards pay-to-win. They've even begun putting features that used to be free behind this paywall, such as seeing how much damage you did to structures after a match. This means that if you don't already know what item you should be using on a particular hero to destroy towers most effectively, then you'll have to pay to get the information---or hope you guess right, or rely on the community for help.But by their own statistic only 79% of players currently have a low report rate. Not to mention they limit how many players you can report per week making it an engineered statistic. Only 79% it says!.....With 10 players in each game this means that every game you will have to deal with at least 2 players (21%) who the developers feel deserve to be reported by multiple people.....but they only let you report about 3 players per week.I don't know anyone playing this game who plays less than 3 games per week. There is only one way to avoid this which is by playing lobby mode, where only your friends are allowed. The problem is that those games don't count and when 10 friends decide to only play lobbies it takes them out of the matchmaking.I have well over 100 friends who play dota 2; That's what keeps me playing. But I expect all this new hidden stuff will just keep making it worse. It's a lot like Facebook in that way. But if you've never played it, and you can play other games with your friends, I recommend skipping dota 2.Dota 2 is currently better than not playing anything with your friends, but that's about it."

Also the matchmaking is still horribly unfair.Edit Patch 7.07: 2 got two new heroes, and planned seasons. Party matchmaking is still horribly broken. Smurfs are still there. So stay away from this game.Edit Patch 7.07c: We now have skill medals, MMR is more or less hidden by now. Matchmaking especially in party is even worse. In about 50% the games you have to fight against smurfs because high ranked players can't find decent matches so they use their smurf. Maybe Valve is hoping that people will be less smurfing because they are recalibrated after 6 months but the true issue is that people always use their smurf account in party matches to stomp lower players. I still can't recommend it.Edit Patch 7.09: Valve now releases a balance update every two weeks. That's good and fine, there are lot of bugs and things to get done. Party matchmaking has really improved but the solo matchmaking is more and more filled with smurfs stomping mid. It's no fun anymore. So please Valve finally do something about it.Edit Patch 7.12: We now have Dota+ to pay for guides powered by data-mining and can do quests to level up heros. Smurfing/boosting is worse than ever. In every third game is at least one booster. Where solo matchmaking sometimes compensates this by matching with other booster, party-matchmaking is ridicously."

27,"4,516.5",Not Recommended, March 13,28,"Here is my problem with the recent addition of DotA Plus: Valve openly condemned the use of similar programs in the past, programs like DOTABUFF Plus and a similar program on OverWolf, and I believe they have threatened to or have given temporary bans for people caught using such programs (don't quote me on that last line, only heard rumors about the bans). This was a few months ago, they vocalized this in one of their newsletters. And now, all of a sudden, they want to ride the hype train by offering a paid version of what players can already get for free (with the addition of accesories to try and justify the price).There is nothing intrinsically wrong with DotA Plus in such a way that it offers an unfair advantage - it doesn't increase your damage or anything, it just gives (rarely) useful insight into hero drafting, and that's it. If people feel inclined that they spend money for a computer to tell them how to draft their heroes, jokes on them because again, they are free versions available. In fact, you don't even need a program - what these programs do is basically give you a small, fast windowed version from websitess like DOTABUFF that carry all the statistics such as winrates between heroes and common hero laning. Theoretically you can just alt-tab to the website and type in everything, it's just inconvenient because it takes longer to switch windows and type in a timely manner during the drafting phase. These programs eliminate the inconveniences of alt-tabbing and typing, it automates the search-up of heroes and pops up the results in a wondow. That's it. People have gotten punished for using these draft helpers not long ago (again, only rumored that people got temp-bans) and now Valve decides to turn a blind eye on what they have been doing and make us pay for the same type of program because they added some cosmetics.In other words, Valve banned people who used these free programs because it was 'cheating' (not really), and then come out with the same program but in order to use it, you need to pay by monthly subscription (with hero accessories). Scam if I ever heard one. Not supporting this behavior, too many games get ruined because of actions like this, World of Tanks for one example."
48,14.4,Recommended," January 10, 2014",30,"One of my favorite games in my library. My play time reflects how much time I have spent appreciating the team work and competitive spirit of the game. Supports who actually support the team, carries who can carry the team to victory, and players who can execute a base push as timely as the New York Sunway. By the way, I love subway sandwiches. I eat a BLT without the T almost every week. Bacon is the most delicious meat. Lettuce is like the cup to the tea party. You can't have tea without water, and you can't hold water without cups. Unless of course you use your hands. Or your mouth. But lettuce cups are pretty delicious. So imagine the bacon and the lettuce together but without the disgusting creatures known as tomatoes. Which while they rhyme with potato, don't taste anything similar. If potatoes tasted like french fries, tomatoes would taste like awful fried wet vegetables.Speaking of wet tables, If you put water on tables, it gets wet. Not stuff like multiplication tables that are way too complicated. What is 6X6? Its like 64 or something. Which is like 10 if you add them all together. What does that mean? I am not sure. Math is hard. Unlike DOTA2. Which is a great game. Especially as a carry.Actually I never played carry before. It seems like a pretty easy job though.Just kill things until you win the game. That is a pretty simple job description. Unlike support or mid or offlane or jungle. I mean jungle is a location, how is it a job? It is more like a forest than a jungle. I mean jungles have lions and stuff right? Forests have angry bears. I am not sure where man-birds and horse-men are from though. Horses aren't jungle creatures I think. They sound more like mountain creatures to be honest. I haven't seen a troll before or a gnoll, but I bet they are forest creatures as well too. So jungle should really be called forest.Mid is a pretty self explanatory position. Its the middle of the map lane. Like if you had 3 lanes, he would take the second one. Or she. There are female heroes as well. Are they called heroines? Well I wouldn't want to call anyone a dangerously addicting drug. That would be sexist. I mean playing Lina is pretty addicting though. Fire fire fire fire fire fire fire fire fire fire .Its like if you had a charmander and combined it with a jynx. Thats what lina is. Which reminds me that pokemon recently came out. X and Y are pretty popular with my friends, so I wamt a 3DS. Those things cost money though, but I head I can trade my items for cash. That sounds pretty amazing. Earning money while palying games, its like the American dream for people who don't want actual jobs. Not that I have a job yet. All I do is stay home and read manga. Which is pronounced mane gah, Like mango but with an a. I sometimes forget myself and add a false accent though and pronounce it mahn gaaaa.So offlane is the lane opposite of the safe lane. So the dangerous lane as they would call it. It isn't very safe cause you cross the mystical safety river to fight bad guys. Its like chinese vampires and running water. I don't think they can cross running water. Many they would have a hard time with modern day plumbing. One flush of the toilet and the go poof. Or do they? I actually know nothing about chinese vampires. I only know vampires from the books my friends lent me. It was the Twilight saga. I really preferred the Jacob to the other guy though. I was pretty upset when Bella made the wrong choice. I mean who wouldnt want a guy you could play fetch whenever you wanted. Plus the other guy was like 439434 years old. Yuck!So Support is the last job you can play. Not only do you provide moral support because most teams don't ever have asupport, but you also help buy buying items no one else in their right minds would buy. Like a slave donkey to carry your items for you. He can even be given magical wings for more than his actual buying price. Why wouldn't I want another donkey instead of one flying one? I am pretty sure two donkeys are cooler than one flying one. I mean how would you even catch a flying donkey? It could poop from like 60 feet and it would be awful. Like a divebombing terrible smelling equine terror. But donkeys are pretty cute. So keep them on the ground. If donkeys were meant to fly, god would have evolved them wings instead of using magic.So that is Dota. Its a pretty good game. But it has some problems too. After all, even BLT's have T's. Here are the digusting parts of the BLT.Games take a while to finish. So if you tend to have sudden gas attacks like me, you might have an accident while you are playing a particular game. A game of Dota can last from as long as 30 seconds to 50 hours. Like I am not even joking how troublesome it is to stay on the toiler for over an house to finish my game of Dota. I mean look at my avatar. That is my face for like the first 5 minutes of Dota before my legs fall asleep and I start getting cramps.It also has too many different heroes. I think the game could cut its hero count down to about 7. It would also encourage faster hero picking if the last 3 players couldn't choose any hero. It is a definitely annoying to choose the tree hero and the enemy hero picks an all fire team and the lumberjack hero. You are literally counterpicked because you chose too early. It would be better to give some kind of gold option or a repick option.Some game modes take forever. Like captains draft can be much shorter if they removed all the bans. Sometimes I want to make team electric, but then a ban comes up and I accidentally ban Mr. Thunder or the masked electric emo. Then Team thunder is ruined. I can understand why bans could be good though. Cause everyone chooses fat butcher guy. He uses his hook to hug you then you smell him to death. Sometimes he tickles you for extra damage. What is worse is that he eats you, he gets fatter and stronger.The biggest tomato of the problem is the fact that the game has too much action, but not enough story. Its like worse than Dynasty Warriors when it comes to story. I could use a few cutscenes telling me why I am teaming up with a giant spider, a porcupine, a baby rock, and a angel man. At least there was a reason in Dynasty Warriors 7 about why I am fighting Guan Yu with my hated enemies the filthy Wu. Were those filthy Wu actually even men? The way they fought with their cowardly fire arrows and powerful navy instead of facing the numerically and superiorly led enemy army head on just screams uncultured barbarians.So I think I will give the game a 1/10/14. Its a pretty good game, but the lack of story gives it only a 1 in that category. I understand that every hero has its own lore, but the bigger connection is quite lost when I team up with my biggest rival against my best friend. A 10 grade for the excellent team spirit of the game. People play like men instead of filthy Wu women.But Ali, why the 14 and not a 17? Because the game has that huge tomato. And I hate Tomatoes. I love BLT's without the T. BL is the greatest invention of man, till someone introduced the uncessary T. I would have BL everyday if I could afford it, but I have no job and spend all my time reading manga."

Sometimes it is better to humble them so they dont make themselves look dumb as hell the next time they decide to say stupid things.Sometimes its better to let them ride it out because they simply cannot help themselves. I found out from my friends they will frequently move onto another subject matter when they realize senpai is not noticing them :(Pro Tip #3: Have fun, dont let these raging morons ruin the game for you like they did me. If you follow Pro Tips 1 & 2, the reactions to the ragers is priceless, it demolishes their spirit and will think twice about their redherring tactics and actually l2p and git gud.Extra: Had one guy messaging me for several weeks and creating different accounts in order to throw racial slurs.

18,"3,188.2",Recommended," July 31, 2014",5,"Dota 2 is a multiplayer game (though you can play against bots). There are two teams of five players - the Radiant, and the Dire. Each player picks from a list of many characters, each with a different set of abilities. The two teams start on opposing sides of the map (there's only one map in the game). Each team has a base area, in which resides an ""Ancient"". From each base, creeps - these autonomous NPC creatures - spawn periodically in waves, and start a journey toward's the other teams base. Towers are scattered around the map that will automatically fire on any enemy unit.The goal for each team is to destroy the other team's Ancient, while defending their own. Hence: Defense of the Ancients.Sounds simple - but there's a lot more to it than this. Imagine the game starts and both teams just stay in their own base. Creeps from both teams will wander out from one base and head to the other, meeting somewhere in the middle of the map, where they will fight (again, they do this automatically without any player input). The creeps are evenly matched so typically they will both wipe each other out. The next wave of creeps will clean up anything left over - or they'll reach a tower, and get smashed by it - and the cycle will continue.Basically, nothing will happen - the game will not end, because the creeps can't get anywhere. Now imagine just one player from one of the teams goes out with his creeps. He can attack the enemy creeps, and support his own creeps as they make their way across the map, knocking down towers along the way. Eventually, he'll get to the enemy Ancient, and be able to destroy it. But if just one enemy player comes out to meet him, the teams will be more evenly matched - and it comes down to a player versus player (PvP) scenario.The PvP is, of course, the heart of the game. It is of a high level of complexity - the learning curve is quite steep, making it challenging for noobs, which is one of the reasons why the community was famed for being full of what I will euphemistically call ""short tempered people"". One player who doesn't know what he is doing can easily bring down the whole team.The complexity comes from two main parts - first, the sheer number of selectable characters in the game. At the time of writing, there are 102 characters - with more added periodically as the game is updated. Each character has four different abilities (sometimes more) that are active (requiring the user to press something to make them go) or passive (they just operate automatically). The abilities are character-specific, though there are common elements between them. Some of the abilities require chaining to use them effectively, and each ability is leveled individually as your character earns experience.After you've done the maths and figured out how many different abilities there are between all the characters - and thought about how long it would take to become familiar with even a small handful of them - consider that in addition to that, there are over 120 different items that you can equip your character with. Items can perform new actions or augment your existing ones (again, they are active or passive in nature).Oh yeah - each game takes a long time to finish - around 45 minutes is pretty common. You will never get away with saying ""I'll just have a quick game of Dota"" to your significant other - at least, not once they've put up with you playing it a few times.So - learning curve. Big one. Time investment (or sink, if you prefer). Big one. Especially when you're trying to play with other people and they're abusing you for not knowing what you're doing. But the real question is - is it worth it?I've clocked up almost 400 games (and there's still some characters I haven't played). I'm not turning pro any time soon, but have a reasonable handle on the fundamentals. My win rate is about 50%, which seems to be fairly normal. Losing is often traumatic, especially after you've lost a couple of long 45-60 minute games in a row, or you're saddled with random teammates in the matchmaking who are abusive idiots (or just bad).But the games that are good - they're really good. With so many combinations and different ways to exploit them, the level of satisfaction when you're playing with friends and manage to co-ordinate a five-person push on a tower, laying down that perfect combo that takes advantage of all your abilities, wiping out the other team.... well, that's what keeps me coming back for more.Not only that, but once you've invested a bunch of time and gotten over some initial learning humps, it's genuinely fun exploring the different characters and item combinations. There are always new builds to try and new items to buy. I've gone through several ""favourite characters"", depending on which new ones I've played recently and how well they worked out with my natural play style and with my teammates. Even after around 400 hours of gametime, I still have more to explore.I do, however, only really enjoy playing the game with my friends. I've tried a few games ""solo"", just picking up teammates using the matchmaking service, and I find this massively less fun. It's less engaging because I typically don't like to communicate with randoms via voice, and your chances of picking up toxic players are increased. I've had good games with randoms, but generally don't bother playing unless my mates are online.As with all reviews, this one attempts to help answer the question: ""should I buy this game?"". Well, good news - Dota 2 is free. It has just come out of a long invite-only beta period, so your actual financial investment in whether or not you should get into the game is zero. But there are two big questions you need to ask yourself:1. Can I justify the amount of time I need to get decent at this game before I start enjoying it?Make no mistake, the learning process for this game is An Ordeal. If you're prepared to spend many hours reading guides and playing with bots until you can beat them on a reasonable difficulty - maybe 10 games? - then that's a good start. If you've got mates that are happy to babysit you then that's good - but note that most of them will not want to do this because it almost certainly means they'll be losing (a lot) while you're still struggling with the basics.The best way to approach it is to read some guides - I recommend Welcome to Dota, You Suck - and play with bots until you can beat them on Hard, reliably, with one character. Then find some friends who are happy to play with you knowing your noob status, and play some games online with them. The more friends the better; if you're matchmaking with randoms they will probably be less tolerant.2. Why is it free? I seriously can play this without paying anything?Dota 2 is built on the ""freemium"" model. It's free to play, and you can purchase in-game items for money. By giving the game away, Valve hope to make more money selling in-game items than if they'd charged for the game. This is an increasing trend - so get used to seeing it more, especially for games with a strong network effect (i.e., anything with multiplayer).The things you can buy for Dota 2 are basically adornments for the characters. For example, you can outfit them with new armour, or a new sword, or some new spell effects, that are different from the stock-standard one that they come with. You can get some of these for free - they'll randomly drop at the end of games - but the good ones for your preferred characters you'll have to shell out for.It's very important to note that these items are purely decorative and have no impact on the gameplay at all. You can't pay money for a new sword that does more damage - it just looks different. This is critical and stops the game from becoming a silly pay-to-win thing. If you're a content creator, you can also create your own stuff and sell it in the store (splitting revenue with Valve)."

It can be quite fun when you pull off great ability combos. I would recommend getting a squad of at least three friends to play, preferrably experienced players who are not quick to get angry. This will make your team more organised and efficient. Communication is really important.Secondly, it will be a safer learning environment for new players. If you ever enter a solo match, changes of getting a toxic team member is fairly high. However, there are also many patient veterans who will give constructive feedback. Pic your teammates wisely if you can.Dota 2 is a well made game and balanced. OP characters always get nerfed eventually except for Phantom Assassin. As said before, it can be very fun when you get really cool people in a match. It can also be frustrating if you get people who do not speak your language or people who just are toxic. If you constantly get the latter, you may want to take a break from the game for a while. Just like many others have said, this game can be really addictive.Grade 8/10"

The reason i choose dota over LoL is beacuse of the friendly community and the helpful players i often find in the games who are always willing to help me out if im stuck with what to buy or when they're telling me i shouldn't be initiating teamfights as the courier but whatever this game is great i'd give it a solid 7/10 just beacuse it's such an easy game to pick up after about 100 games you will have the basics mastered like how to last hit the minions and once you have that down you can learn how to kill your own minions to deny gold which is pretty hard and i still can't do it properly. I hope that in the next 20 games or so in can manage to get the basics of jungling down because it's very complicated and i always forget to eat the trees for health LOL. yes would reccomend definately to any new players looking for an online moba game which is really easy to pick up and get going aftert 10 games.

53,784.2,Recommended," July 15, 2017",15,"I have been playing this game for over a year and I have to say that before I knew about DotA 2, I never would have thought that a game would bring me the greatest pain I've ever felt. Really, everything about this game is toxic and sucks. The community is horrible as ♥♥♥♥ and so is the matchmaking. People picking support heroes actually aren't able to do their job and instead of buying wards and supporting the team, what they are actually meant to do, they go for their ♥♥♥♥ing items first and don't even think about upgrading the courier after minute 3 (yeah, and it's unnecessary to mention that they sometimes don't buy this courier at all). So I am asking myself: Who in the hell♥♥♥♥♥♥into their head for them to do such stupid things? It' all about teamplay in this game and the game can only be won when every player does his job instead of jerking around! And when there are already 4 carries, why the ♥♥♥♥ do you, the last one for picking, go for a carry hero, too? That makes no sense! While playing DotA 2 I discovered that this game brings out a really dark side of me. Normally I'm a calm and relaxed person but DotA 2 forces me to go to the limit and for the first time in my young life I realized that I can be toxic and salty like the rest of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, too when the game doesn't go well because my team mates are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s again. That's why I prefer to play with friends instead of going alone. If it's your lucky day, you will have a nice team which knows how to play and if not, then let me say this: RIP! There is no more to say, really. You will get this cancer gang and the game will be ♥♥♥♥ed up. Furthermore, you will waste more or less 40 minutes of your precious time. But trust me, it will take longer, way longer, trust me. And because you are a masochist like me you won't quit this game, although you often say to yourself that this will be the last game you have ever played before deleting DotA 2. No, instead of quitting the game you will play more and more matches, you will get mad as hell, learn russian (and persian) for free and this will be a vicious circle. You can't get out of it. You are trapped in this game. It's really sad. I've tried so hard but always end up playing when I have some time.So here are my advices:1. Never play alone when you have just started this game and don't have enough experience yet.2. Always have some foods and drinks (preferably alcoholic) next to you, because playing and flaming will burn your energy which you actually need for a win. Or maybe for more flaming.3. Schedule your free time. It's not only 40 minutes you will spend on this game, actually it will be more than this. Sometimes the whole day is ruined by DotA 2. Once you start playing, you can't stop anymore.4. You have to be thick-skinned or having nerves of steel. There is no other way to endure this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ community.You get it? Great! Then I wish you guys lots of joy playing DotA 2! :3"

Loads of heroes to choose from and heaps of items to go along. The training system is a precious help and introduces you to the last hits, denies, shopping for items and combining items, allows you to play with a few noob-friendly (not easy and not weaker than the other ones, mind you, just not that complicated to master in the early stages of the game) heroes to get you to feel the game's pace.From then on, you still have a lot to learn. Everybody can use ALL heroes for free and there's no advantage anyone has over you except their own experience in the game. But there are plenty of heroes to go around and until you've played them all (or played against them) at least once, you'll be feeling like a noob when you face one for the first time.Dota 2 is rather unforgiving when it comes to carries. You die, you lose time, experience and GOLD. And you need GOLD to buy items to allow you to carry. Not that easy for supports either. Most of them do have the uppoer hand on some carries on the early stages of the game, but you need to know them in order to take advantage of that. Also, your abilities' damage doesn't really scale all that well to late game, where the carries start to shine. There are dozens of ward spots, jungling tricks and control points you need to master. Every game's different. Lanes are pretty unpredictable at Dota 2. You can have 2-1-2, but you can have a 1-1-3, a 1-2-2, or, if you have some jungler, you can have 1-1-1-2 os something like that. The game's pretty dynamic.Do check some guides and builds. They can help you in your first contacts with some heroes. But, hey... it's Dota 2. Everything's situational. Sure, there are a few core items on many heroes, but, all in all, it all depends on the game you're playing and a change can make ALL the difference.Again, if you're into MOBAs... Do try it. NOW!"

229,"3,035.6",Recommended," August 31, 2013",5,"To fully illustrate what makes DOTA one of the most compelling multiplayer games of all time, it helps to have a bit of background on the game itself.DOTA has its roots as a Warcraft 3 modification. Warcraft 3 introduced a unique mechanic in its campaign and multiplayer modes of ""hero"" units - units that actually gained experience points, abilities, and items as the game progresses. This really made it feel like you had an investment in these units, and you grew attached to them. To a degree these hero units, effectively commanders of your army of relatively disposable units, became your avatar in-game. It was a brilliant concept, and DOTA took it a step further.DOTA created a multiplayer mode that focused *exclusively* on playing these hero units - it removed the base building and unit management seen in the standard RTS format. It's one of the best examples of ""less is more"" than I've ever seen, and that description hardly does it justice. Managing your individual hero and your income, position on the map, constant decision making, and being able to size yourself up versus your enemy brings more depth than any other game I've ever played.I've yet to play any other multiplayer game where *every* member of your 5-man team is crucial to your victory. Everyone must do their part, and do it better than the other 5-man team. There are very few cases of where a game can be winnable 4v5, and teamwork becomes a huge factor. In the most intense and close games, the level of immersion really can't be matched. It's hard to think of another game that draws you in more than DOTA, especially when other people are counting on you to do well!It's a hectic, stressful, enormously complex and in-depth experience - not to mention absurdly fun. This is what keeps me coming back, and I'd recommend it to anyone looking to really experience what multiplayer gaming can truly offer.If you're new to the game and want some background on specific heroes and strategies, or just want to watch some gameplay, be sure to check out my YouTube channel.

ALWAYS the same picks on the same games, Invoker broke the game and is probably picked in 5 every 8 matches and win on 4 of them. Dota 2 (not reborn) was way better and balanced. It is also infested with Smurfs, don't be surprised if you just started playing and you see someone with 34/2 K/D on your match, not that it's a problem for old players (that use to smurf a lot nowdays) but it kinda make new players forfeit playing this game for it's so hard to have a match against people that actually started playing. Even though i think you should give it a try if you get used to these problems, it's a very good game and pretty addicting, but i think I just had enough."
223,882.1,Recommended," November 24, 2017",11,"Dota 2Dota 2 is good game. It has a very steep learning curve. However, when you finally learn how the complex mechanics work. It can be quite fun when you pull off great ability combos. I would recommend getting a squad of at least three friends to play, preferrably experienced players who are not quick to get angry. This will make your team more organised and efficient. Communication is really important.Secondly, it will be a safer learning environment for new players. If you ever enter a solo match, changes of getting a toxic team member is fairly high. However, there are also many patient veterans who will give constructive feedback. Pic your teammates wisely if you can.Dota 2 is a well made game and balanced. OP characters always get nerfed eventually except for Phantom Assassin. As said before, it can be very fun when you get really cool people in a match. It can also be frustrating if you get people who do not speak your language or people who just are toxic. If you constantly get the latter, you may want to take a break from the game for a while. Just like many others have said, this game can be really addictive.Grade 8/10"

It can be fun and challenging and it is mostly very well balanced (compare to other game of this genre)Positive:-It´s free to play and not pay to win-There are like over 110 heroes to choose and everyone got it´s own special play style-It´s a very great game to play with friends-The game is based on high skill, sometimes a bit luck and of course on teamplay-The game has a ""never give"" up effect-Once you started to play Dota 2, you wont every be able to stop playing it-The workshop adds nice new thing into the game like skins (Made for fans by fans)-There are many cool gamemodes-The competitive scence is very fun to watch and you can learn very much from the pros-There are many reallife events based on Dota 2 like the TI-The game never gets boring-It´s like a passionNegative:-Let´s be honest: The Community(There are so many arrogant and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ people in Dota 2 that sometimes it´s just make me wanna cry and that´s of course very brutal for noobs. But i have to say just move on and play, ignore these stupid players)-In my perspective, Dota 2 is very well balanced but there are still heroes who are just too strong and broke which can frustrate hard-Language problems(There are like in every game some Russians who think they can freely write russian in the chat although it´s an english server. I think that´s unrespectful towards the people who actually write english although they are also from other countries besides Russia like me)-Pauses(Seriously these unpauses ♥♥♥♥s everyone up and nobody is able to wait for like 3 minutes -.-)My rating for Dota 2 would be 95 out of 100That´s all from me.

181,2.6,Recommended," September 22, 2014",9,this is an excellnt game if you want a really dynamic playstyle and a unique item shop which offers much variation. The reason i choose dota over LoL is beacuse of the friendly community and the helpful players i often find in the games who are always willing to help me out if im stuck with what to buy or when they're telling me i shouldn't be initiating teamfights as the courier but whatever this game is great i'd give it a solid 7/10 just beacuse it's such an easy game to pick up after about 100 games you will have the basics mastered like how to last hit the minions and once you have that down you can learn how to kill your own minions to deny gold which is pretty hard and i still can't do it properly. I hope that in the next 20 games or so in can manage to get the basics of jungling down because it's very complicated and i always forget to eat the trees for health LOL. yes would reccomend definately to any new players looking for an online moba game which is really easy to pick up and get going aftert 10 games.

The game doesnt seem like colored creatures punching eachother.Welcome to dota 2.Noob Advice: read guides when your trying out new heroes. Practice in bots, and dont stick to one hero, play them all. And stick in there, your first 10 games will suck. Purge has some great guides that you really should watch before you even step into your first game. And also play with friends, otherwise you might have to put up with peruvians who keep screaming noob in chat when you make one mistake. People who have to rage at everything (thats why theres reports), and russians who will play uber aggresive all the time, which to be fair on there part works half of the time.

18,"3,188.2",Recommended," July 31, 2014",5,"Dota 2 is a multiplayer game (though you can play against bots). There are two teams of five players - the Radiant, and the Dire. Each player picks from a list of many characters, each with a different set of abilities. The two teams start on opposing sides of the map (there's only one map in the game). Each team has a base area, in which resides an ""Ancient"". From each base, creeps - these autonomous NPC creatures - spawn periodically in waves, and start a journey toward's the other teams base. Towers are scattered around the map that will automatically fire on any enemy unit.The goal for each team is to destroy the other team's Ancient, while defending their own. Hence: Defense of the Ancients.Sounds simple - but there's a lot more to it than this. Imagine the game starts and both teams just stay in their own base. Creeps from both teams will wander out from one base and head to the other, meeting somewhere in the middle of the map, where they will fight (again, they do this automatically without any player input). The creeps are evenly matched so typically they will both wipe each other out. The next wave of creeps will clean up anything left over - or they'll reach a tower, and get smashed by it - and the cycle will continue.Basically, nothing will happen - the game will not end, because the creeps can't get anywhere. Now imagine just one player from one of the teams goes out with his creeps. He can attack the enemy creeps, and support his own creeps as they make their way across the map, knocking down towers along the way. Eventually, he'll get to the enemy Ancient, and be able to destroy it. But if just one enemy player comes out to meet him, the teams will be more evenly matched - and it comes down to a player versus player (PvP) scenario.The PvP is, of course, the heart of the game. It is of a high level of complexity - the learning curve is quite steep, making it challenging for noobs, which is one of the reasons why the community was famed for being full of what I will euphemistically call ""short tempered people"". One player who doesn't know what he is doing can easily bring down the whole team.The complexity comes from two main parts - first, the sheer number of selectable characters in the game. At the time of writing, there are 102 characters - with more added periodically as the game is updated. Each character has four different abilities (sometimes more) that are active (requiring the user to press something to make them go) or passive (they just operate automatically). The abilities are character-specific, though there are common elements between them. Some of the abilities require chaining to use them effectively, and each ability is leveled individually as your character earns experience.After you've done the maths and figured out how many different abilities there are between all the characters - and thought about how long it would take to become familiar with even a small handful of them - consider that in addition to that, there are over 120 different items that you can equip your character with. Items can perform new actions or augment your existing ones (again, they are active or passive in nature).Oh yeah - each game takes a long time to finish - around 45 minutes is pretty common. You will never get away with saying ""I'll just have a quick game of Dota"" to your significant other - at least, not once they've put up with you playing it a few times.So - learning curve. Big one. Time investment (or sink, if you prefer). Big one. Especially when you're trying to play with other people and they're abusing you for not knowing what you're doing. But the real question is - is it worth it?I've clocked up almost 400 games (and there's still some characters I haven't played). I'm not turning pro any time soon, but have a reasonable handle on the fundamentals. My win rate is about 50%, which seems to be fairly normal. Losing is often traumatic, especially after you've lost a couple of long 45-60 minute games in a row, or you're saddled with random teammates in the matchmaking who are abusive idiots (or just bad).But the games that are good - they're really good. With so many combinations and different ways to exploit them, the level of satisfaction when you're playing with friends and manage to co-ordinate a five-person push on a tower, laying down that perfect combo that takes advantage of all your abilities, wiping out the other team.... well, that's what keeps me coming back for more.Not only that, but once you've invested a bunch of time and gotten over some initial learning humps, it's genuinely fun exploring the different characters and item combinations. There are always new builds to try and new items to buy. I've gone through several ""favourite characters"", depending on which new ones I've played recently and how well they worked out with my natural play style and with my teammates. Even after around 400 hours of gametime, I still have more to explore.I do, however, only really enjoy playing the game with my friends. I've tried a few games ""solo"", just picking up teammates using the matchmaking service, and I find this massively less fun. It's less engaging because I typically don't like to communicate with randoms via voice, and your chances of picking up toxic players are increased. I've had good games with randoms, but generally don't bother playing unless my mates are online.As with all reviews, this one attempts to help answer the question: ""should I buy this game?"". Well, good news - Dota 2 is free. It has just come out of a long invite-only beta period, so your actual financial investment in whether or not you should get into the game is zero. But there are two big questions you need to ask yourself:1. Can I justify the amount of time I need to get decent at this game before I start enjoying it?Make no mistake, the learning process for this game is An Ordeal. If you're prepared to spend many hours reading guides and playing with bots until you can beat them on a reasonable difficulty - maybe 10 games? - then that's a good start. If you've got mates that are happy to babysit you then that's good - but note that most of them will not want to do this because it almost certainly means they'll be losing (a lot) while you're still struggling with the basics.The best way to approach it is to read some guides - I recommend Welcome to Dota, You Suck - and play with bots until you can beat them on Hard, reliably, with one character. Then find some friends who are happy to play with you knowing your noob status, and play some games online with them. The more friends the better; if you're matchmaking with randoms they will probably be less tolerant.2. Why is it free? I seriously can play this without paying anything?Dota 2 is built on the ""freemium"" model. It's free to play, and you can purchase in-game items for money. By giving the game away, Valve hope to make more money selling in-game items than if they'd charged for the game. This is an increasing trend - so get used to seeing it more, especially for games with a strong network effect (i.e., anything with multiplayer).The things you can buy for Dota 2 are basically adornments for the characters. For example, you can outfit them with new armour, or a new sword, or some new spell effects, that are different from the stock-standard one that they come with. You can get some of these for free - they'll randomly drop at the end of games - but the good ones for your preferred characters you'll have to shell out for.It's very important to note that these items are purely decorative and have no impact on the gameplay at all. You can't pay money for a new sword that does more damage - it just looks different. This is critical and stops the game from becoming a silly pay-to-win thing. If you're a content creator, you can also create your own stuff and sell it in the store (splitting revenue with Valve)."

229,"3,035.6",Recommended," August 31, 2013",5,"To fully illustrate what makes DOTA one of the most compelling multiplayer games of all time, it helps to have a bit of background on the game itself.DOTA has its roots as a Warcraft 3 modification. Warcraft 3 introduced a unique mechanic in its campaign and multiplayer modes of ""hero"" units - units that actually gained experience points, abilities, and items as the game progresses. This really made it feel like you had an investment in these units, and you grew attached to them. To a degree these hero units, effectively commanders of your army of relatively disposable units, became your avatar in-game. It was a brilliant concept, and DOTA took it a step further.DOTA created a multiplayer mode that focused *exclusively* on playing these hero units - it removed the base building and unit management seen in the standard RTS format. It's one of the best examples of ""less is more"" than I've ever seen, and that description hardly does it justice. Managing your individual hero and your income, position on the map, constant decision making, and being able to size yourself up versus your enemy brings more depth than any other game I've ever played.I've yet to play any other multiplayer game where *every* member of your 5-man team is crucial to your victory. Everyone must do their part, and do it better than the other 5-man team. There are very few cases of where a game can be winnable 4v5, and teamwork becomes a huge factor. In the most intense and close games, the level of immersion really can't be matched. It's hard to think of another game that draws you in more than DOTA, especially when other people are counting on you to do well!It's a hectic, stressful, enormously complex and in-depth experience - not to mention absurdly fun. This is what keeps me coming back, and I'd recommend it to anyone looking to really experience what multiplayer gaming can truly offer.If you're new to the game and want some background on specific heroes and strategies, or just want to watch some gameplay, be sure to check out my YouTube channel. Thanks for reading!"

Really sucks you in after you get past the steep learning curve. I do believe it is dying however (as of 10/5/17), and you might need to be on the lookout for somethign else. But to the point, Dota 2 is really complicated and emphasizes a lot of itemization and farming. Also, the early game is very important and throughout all the game, many mistakes are heavily punished. Look into this game if you really want to put forth a huge grind, but if you plan to take this casual I suggest you play this with a few friends because in my opinion, solo is pretty dry."

53,784.2,Recommended," July 15, 2017",15,"I have been playing this game for over a year and I have to say that before I knew about DotA 2, I never would have thought that a game would bring me the greatest pain I've ever felt. Really, everything about this game is toxic and sucks. The community is horrible as ♥♥♥♥ and so is the matchmaking. People picking support heroes actually aren't able to do their job and instead of buying wards and supporting the team, what they are actually meant to do, they go for their ♥♥♥♥ing items first and don't even think about upgrading the courier after minute 3 (yeah, and it's unnecessary to mention that they sometimes don't buy this courier at all). So I am asking myself: Who in the hell♥♥♥♥♥♥into their head for them to do such stupid things? It' all about teamplay in this game and the game can only be won when every player does his job instead of jerking around! And when there are already 4 carries, why the ♥♥♥♥ do you, the last one for picking, go for a carry hero, too? That makes no sense! While playing DotA 2 I discovered that this game brings out a really dark side of me. Normally I'm a calm and relaxed person but DotA 2 forces me to go to the limit and for the first time in my young life I realized that I can be toxic and salty like the rest of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, too when the game doesn't go well because my team mates are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s again. That's why I prefer to play with friends instead of going alone. If it's your lucky day, you will have a nice team which knows how to play and if not, then let me say this: RIP! There is no more to say, really. You will get this cancer gang and the game will be ♥♥♥♥ed up. Furthermore, you will waste more or less 40 minutes of your precious time. But trust me, it will take longer, way longer, trust me. And because you are a masochist like me you won't quit this game, although you often say to yourself that this will be the last game you have ever played before deleting DotA 2. No, instead of quitting the game you will play more and more matches, you will get mad as hell, learn russian (and persian) for free and this will be a vicious circle. You can't get out of it. You are trapped in this game. It's really sad. I've tried so hard but always end up playing when I have some time.So here are my advices:1. Never play alone when you have just started this game and don't have enough experience yet.2. Always have some foods and drinks (preferably alcoholic) next to you, because playing and flaming will burn your energy which you actually need for a win. Or maybe for more flaming.3. Schedule your free time. It's not only 40 minutes you will spend on this game, actually it will be more than this. Sometimes the whole day is ruined by DotA 2. Once you start playing, you can't stop anymore.4. You have to be thick-skinned or having nerves of steel. There is no other way to endure this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ community.You get it? Great! Then I wish you guys lots of joy playing DotA 2! :3"

66,"1,928.4",Not Recommended," June 27, 2015",5,"This ""game"" is a mistake of nature. Calling it a game alone makes me sick to my stomach, because games are supposed to be fun to play. This ""thing"" is everything but fun. I gave Dota 2 plenty of chances to become a better game, and after 1878 hours of playing it, I quit... I'm done... It is clear now that it will never change. But what could be so bad about this game? Well, allow me to point out all the horrible things this game contains: unbalanced/overrated/abused heroes, unbalanced matchmaking, no region locks, no communication and team work are present. Now let's get into detail:UNBALANCED/OVERRATED/ABUSED HEROES: I don't care who you are, or how good you may be at this game, but nothing you say will convince me otherwise, that there are many heroes in this game that are either broken, played all the time, or both. Let's take Phantom Assassin, for example. 50% evasion is basically 90%, you're going to miss every attack. ""OH, BUT GET MKB, OR PLAY A NUKER"". Mate, firstly MKB is expensive, second, she will almost always have an Omniknight kissing her ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and third, when you always get terrible teams, what do you expect to do? Don't even get me started on Juggernaut and his ""balanced"" ultimate. Oh, I'll just go invulnerable and deal like 3000 damage and get multiple kills, all because I pressed R.UNBALANCED MATCHMAKING: This goes pretty well with the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t heroes I mentioned above! You get those really strong carries and supports on the enemy team, and what do I get? A carry who feeds then responds with ""I haven't played this hero"", a support who doesn't even buy the courier or wards, a mid who flames everyone for losing his lane and etc. Over 75% of the games I've played, I've had this problem. In the end, it all comes down to me and my buddy to actually do something, but 2v5 isn't exactly a fair game.NO REGION LOCKS: Have you ever wanted to go into a game and have a team to communicate with? Well too bad, move along. This game isn't for you. Because almost every game I have, my team is filled with foreigners who only know the word ""♥♥♥♥"" or ""suck"" in English. What's the point of setting your preferred language to English if you're not gonna get people like that most of the time?NO COMMUNICATION WITH THE TEAM: This goes so well with the reason I mentioned above. Since most people I find are either Russians or some other people I don't know, communication is impossible. Even if I do find someone who speaks English, there's a 50/50 chance, that he'll be a retard who will blame and flame his team.The only redeeming factor of this game, is that some of the heroes are actually cool and fun, and I've grown to like a few certain characters, but even that isn't enough for me to return. I'm done, so I'll just stick to watching pro players on YouTube. So here are my final words:Screw Dota 2. Screw its toxic community. Screw the MOBA genre in general. And especially screw Juggernaut, ♥♥♥♥ him forever. Avoid this game at all costs, unless you hate yourself and you want to quickly contract cancer, ebola, aids and who knows what else."

They had a solid (and diehard loyal) group of players and 7.00 is like spitting in our mouths and telling us its champagne.I see what they're doing. Valve wants to appeal to a younger generation of players that does not (I repeat) does not want to play Dota 2. That is why they play League of Legends or Heroes of the Storm or Smite. They want a fast paced game that requires little to no knowledge of tactics, strategy or the game's mechanics.I used to say Dota 2 was the chess of MOBAs; difficult and requiring more skill to play than the checkers of MOBAs like League. Now with 7.00, Dota has become a checkers MOBA.Give me back my tactical MOBA, give us back our Chess. Valve, revert the changes back to 6.88 and turn the changes for 7 into DOTA 3.

The subscription is just a straight up kick in the face though, they introduced a more in depth death recap allowing you to easier see what you should be building, they added an auto counter system which yes anyone could just look up who counters who but having the information readily avaliable in the client is straight up a paid unfair advantage.

395,"1,066.1",Recommended," September 29, 2014",14,"Dota 2 is a 5-v-5 MOBA game. You have a selection out of 108 unique heroes, each with a unique skillset. Every hero is also available from the minute you start. No playing X amount of games before this hero becomes available.The object of Dota 2 is to destroy the other teams’ Ancient. To do this, you can work your way down any of the 3 lanes (Top, Mid or Bottom) by destroying the outer towers. You’ll start most matches pairing up or going into a lane solo trying to get some experience and gold by last hitting creeps. As the game progresses, you’ll start teaming up more with your other team members to take on the other team or to quickly kill of a solo member of their team.Because of the importance of coordinating your attacks with other team members, communication is a very important aspect of the game. I therefor also recommend playing this game with some friends because random people that you’ll be teamed up with won’t always show the same willingness to communicate. If you’re just starting out playing Dota 2, I also recommend playing with a friend who already has some experience in the game because the learning curve is very steep, especially when you have to figure everything out by yourself. The skill ceiling is also extremely high. So every time you play, you might learn something new. Due to the high number of available heroes, skills and items, you can be sure that every game is unique.Something to be wary of is the community. There are people out there that take this game way more seriously than you might. Most players have an opinion of what you should have done in a certain situation and will be happy to blame a lost teamfight on you not taking that action. Flaming is something that could happen often. But if you’re playing with a team entirely made up of your friends, this shouldn’t prove to be an issue. If this is not the case, don’t worry. You can always mute the players that are causing you grief and continue enjoying this wonderful, team oriented game."

What is remarkable is, Dota 2 has reached this level of depth and polish in a remarkably short amount of time. What started as a relatively rough beta has blossomed into a competitive game that entertains, captivates and truly engrosses people who are into competitive gaming.Valve has done a bang up job making this game free, and having all of the ""buy"" stuff totally optional to those who are interested in it. I think the method of giving people drops that they can decide to equip or unlock via unlocking chests is genius. I hope they get all of the money."
2,"3,352.6",Recommended," December 15, 2014",10,"I've played this game since I was in my highschool, Dota 1 days were surely a jumpstart for me. Now I'm a licensed Interior Designer and I still play this game. In-game items make this game a whole lot more interesting than before. But since I'm a new player, it's sad to know that DYNAMIC PRESENTS are now unavailable. Rendering Old Players an edge of having good set of items while New ones can never have while they level up. So this makes leveling up your dota profile a bit of useless to me. Leveling up a profile knowing that there is no use or benefit can be disappointing at some point. And hopefully soon there will be an AUTOBAN for rude players in-game. Some sort of a ""PROFANE"" word detection thru out any language. There are a lot of rude and tactless players out there that can most of the time disappoint newbies from playing the game. Not everyone though. But nonetheless, this game is still as awesome for me as it was before in Dota 1. Very nice graphics and enjoyable game. Keep up the good work!"
93,245.8,Recommended," September 6, 2014",10,"Dota2 often claimed to be the hardest MOBA there is and that is because the game is very complex, which is why there is a ~10 hour tutorial trying to breakdown the game mechanics into little pieces and if you want to get faster and easier into it you can't avoid watching videos for more tips'n'tricks, which makes this game very time consuming, not to mention that an average game is between 30 and 50 minutes long.However when you dig yourself through the wall of Dota2 and got to the point, where you start understanding what you are doing wrong. Then the game gets very rewarding and fun.Playing Dota2 is a combination of strategy - which hero to pick, where to lane, what items to buy and satisfying combat, one hero usually has 4 abilities and one of them being there ultimate ability, which is the hero's strongest ability, for newbies, there are a lot of hero's with passives and few abilities.Something, which I don't usually mention in reviews, is the voice acting, this game, although it has 108 different characters, has really good voice acting for every single hero. Although the game is getting to get a bit older now, its graphics are definetly up to date and personally I really like the water, it looks really good.Overall if have a lot of spare time and for a very strategic in-depth game go for it! It is free and you have excess to all heroes from Level 0 on."

You need to pick the right items each time you play as it will decide you will win the game or not. Dota 2 introduce item drops each time you finish a match online. There are many items in Dota 2 that can enhance your favourite heroes looks. Each item has rarity, the more rare the items, the more expensive it will become. Most items can be sold in the Steam Marketplace.Dota 2 has far improved graphics from the previous game. Heroes are even more detailed and the arena has better view. All heroes ability effects are also improved, even the UI is better.Dota 2 has many tournaments that you can participate. The biggest is ""The International"" Dota 2 tournament.

The reporting system does not seem to deal with this. I suggest a social ranking which is used for public match making as well as mmr. Social ranking could be determined as a function of commends v reports.Supports: I play supports almost exclusively. The reason is that if I dont I cant rely on anyone else to. I spend a lot gold on support items at the expense of developing my hero. It is a grind. Because I regularly play supports my level almost always lags behind others so I will rarely see a lot of the new high level options. The new changes do little to make playing a support more enjoyable. Wards should be free and on a timer.Map change: I hate the new map. Visibility is reduced, wards are less effective, it will become a gankers paradise since you cannot ward as effectively. For a prodominently support player who normally takes the role of hard carry baby sitter that is not a prospect I like.EDIT:Snowballing. Talents will accelerate snowballing. My suspicion is that means that the team that handles the transfer from laning phase to ganking phase most efficiently will have a significant advantage. My prediction is stats will show that the team that is dominate after 15 minutes will win almost all games.I doubt anyone from Valve will read this but there it is.So long and thanks for all the fish."

The great thing about this game is the friendly community, I remember after a match the person on the opposite team said I was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥, I assumed that was the German word for Gg.

221,"1,005.4",Recommended," September 24, 2014",6,"Dota 2 is one of those games which cause a myriad of emotions. You'll love it and hate it all at the same time but that doesn't stop it from being the most competitive and professional eSport games on the planet.One of the first negative things you're going to encounter in Dota 2 is the learning curve. It isn't like most games. It requires knowledge of many unique aspects and only after encountering every hero at least once, will you start to get comfortable. If you want to take Dota 2 seriously, or even casually, prepare to invest a lot of time. Guides can of course cut this time substantially.When you do learn to play, you will be rewarded with one of the biggest feelings of accomplishment of any game. You will feel like a god among men - but remember, most people feel this, and as such, the Dota community is one of arrogant and toxic tossers.There are nice players, but there are plenty of unpleasant ones. If you want to play Dota 2 properly, you need to play with friends - or just learn to mute people.Overall, Dota 2 is a team game that is really hard to play casually. You will either love it or hate it - but more often than not, both at the same time."

212,"1,179.8",Recommended," January 16, 2015",6,"Dota 2:As we are entering the moba territory where the fan bases exist to the extremes, I decided to test out all the moba games that I had access to which was League, HoN, HoTS, Smite and Demigod so that I tested out all games fairly and equally.After playing them all I believe that DOTA 2 is probably the best moba out there if you like strategy and a more ‘grownup’ moba game. DOTA 2 does well with a focus on each hero being unique and each having their pros and cons to assist the team in their own special ways, so this means that each match will never be the same due to the choices of heroes and peoples playstyles. It’s developers and lead designer Icefrog have a focus on balancing every hero on every major update and making sure that no hero is extremely overpowered.The game follows Valve’s concept of Free to Play games where the only thing up for purchase is cosmetics with nothing that will change or alter the gameplay, the game also has item drops at the end of the matches but at the time of this review the drop rates were changed and it’s current nigh impossible to even get a single item.The only issue I really see is the issue with some of the servers due to the outsourcing of servers to other companies and their locations. So I’ll write down the list of servers that have issues that I know of:SEA (Location: Singapore) (E-Club) - It’s a gamble, there is two servers and one is good and one is awful. Sometimes up, sometimes down. Good luck.Japan (Location: Tokyo) (NEXON) - It doesn't exist yet, they are holding it hostage for the past year.US Servers (Valve) - They are currently using Mail Pigeon for packets.(West - Seattle, East - Sterling)Russia (Stockholm) (?) - The server is perfectly fine, the only issue is the distance from Russia to Stockholm causes increase latency--------Other than some of the server issues you can have loads of fun and you might even pick up the Russian, Spanish, Portuguese or Filipino languages.Dota is a quality gaming addiction and language learner.10/10"

115,"3,780.7",Not Recommended," January 3, 2015",82,"Dota is less of a game, more of a tool of self discovery. In fact, thinking of dota as a game at all is a mistake; games are designed to be enjoyable and fun. Enjoying yourself and having fun is the the lowest priority for those who play dota, (especially for those in low priority.) they prefer instead to stubbornly not enjoy themselves while simultaneously making sure nobody else is having any fun either.Every facet of the game has been finely tuned to reflect the players personality to the point that each decision they make in game is synonymous with how russian they are they conduct themselves in their day to day lives, what kind of attributes they hold in high esteem and strive to emulate in pursuit of bettering themselves becoming the transcendent doto master they know they're destined to be.Although it seems at first to be a team game of 5v5, this is a very shallow perspective which will correct itself after around fifteen minutes of your first game. Same goes for the goal of destroying the other teams towers, barracks and ancient. These objectives are simply filler while you forcibly and decisively assert your rightful dominance over your team via your mic or hastily written yet crushingly witty remarks in the chat. (don't worry about the other team, they're fighting amongst themselves and don't matter anyway – remember: you're better than your team-mates and it's inconceivable that there's any possibility you did or will ever do anything wrong, regardless of what may be transpiring before your very eyes.)The interface and mini-map should be largely ignored in favour of committing your attention wholly to the chat box, here you can see the current state of the game clearer than anywhere else, it may take a while to understand some of the games many colloquialisms such as ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥блять' and 'no courier gg my team are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ff', but don't worry if you can't understand, it's not so much about comprehension as asserting your right to say things that don't need to be said and are generally trivial and unhelpful.If you find yourself doing poorly and being shouted at by your team for feeding, don't fret. They are likely jealous of your superior skills and can't understand that are actually the ones letting down. Just remind yourself of that one game you had that went freakishly well and make fun of someone’s build.10/10 worst game ever."

The psychological abuse that they encourage players inflict upon each other is unheard of in any other video game i've ever played. The report system is fully automated with no judge or jury and allows gutless trolls and griefers to run amok. They encourage petty 'eye for an eye' behavior instead of good sportsmanship and bully players into staying in a match that has them being battered over and over. They allow griefers to flame the living daylights out of you then when you finally snap and stick up for yourself, those same flamers have you repremanded by said automatic report system and YOU end up being the one who is punished. And what's worse is that those griefers get thanked by Valve for causing harm to other players.But that's not all, people. No the abuse doesn't stop there. For a free to play game, this one will have you spending more money than its worth, dressing up your favorite heroes with expensive hats (some of which can only be won in Valve's treasure chest casino where they encourage children to gamble).Dota has gone from a fun strategy game to a cesspool of greed and mental torture since Valve published its sequel and took over. And now that they're filthy rich they don't even develop their own games anymore. They take the lions share of the profits gained from treasure chests and give the artists who created those skins a mere pittance for their work.If you thought EA was bad, Valve just took the title from them for most soulless games company."

100,"1,733.8",Recommended," September 1, 2017",338,"This review is totally honest. I spent hours upon hours on this game. It was a horrific and quite a sad journey to reach the ""not bad"" skill bracket. Everything in this game, from the toxic community to the rage I have had to endure for this game was difficult and nearly impossible for me to accomplish but i did. After the 1500 hours, I questioned myself, what did I do this for? The fame and money or the fact that the game is so addicting that I chose to play 10 hours of DOTA 2 before my exam. (The result was an E grade which is not bad...Is it??). Could it be that I watched TI6 and TI7 and was inspired to make my mark on the aegis of champions. Whatever the reason, my family despised me for what i had become.In short: DOTA 2 is a game which is not free to play. It requires you to sell your soul to the devil (Valve) and leave your current life for you to become a legend."
2,"1,088.1",Not Recommended," February 14, 2016",4,"Dota has great aspects as an online multipalyer game (team spiritted game).It is a game that I like with graphics, combat mechanics, rpg and arena style but also I hate its community and matchmaking system.It has been prooved that they are using a bad or broken RANKED + MATCHMAKING SySTEM for entire Dota 2 game modes (Elo - which has been suitable for only 1vs1 games and its base is only winning or losing)Their system cannot place skill of a player with accuracy and realistically. They are trying to refuse that their system is broken down because they did very harm on player community with this bad system and maybe they need time or money to sell their stuff who knows?the matchmaking system cannoti) eliminate toxic and bad behavior playersii) decide the real skill level of a playerii)lacks determining how much you are a team player, how much you helaed and participated tem gangs, how much you detsroyed towers, your damaged all enemy, you killed without dying, your potential of gold winning/farmning etc..., and these are all related with your skill level but Dota 2 does not have system to determine it.Dota 2 developers should soon find something that will affect1- Quitters, (intentional leavers) really bad. -10 bad conduct points2-Disconnections should be punished. - 5 bad conduct points3-AFK players - 7 bad condcut points4-and flamers -3 bad conduct points5-and the least , the noobs. (what will determine noobity) = A player shouldn't be competing in games before he does some missions in bot games. That will make a solution for smurf accounting and disorganized, no knowledge pub players. I dont mean being a rookie or not making support stuff should get you out public games but if someone does it usually, this has to cost him/her -1 bad conduct points.-10 points in a time period should make you go for that many games you ruined for low prio.After version 7.07 (2017 November) not has changed yet about the broken system. Still solo matchmaking not just, buggy (technically some heroes maybe spammed to gain mmr, etc etc..) and not well designed.Support Role still not getting what it is worth ( you cannot calibrate a support hero over 2000mmr, if you are not in first %4 skilled dota player)My game SCORE: 48"

313,"1,983.1",Recommended," July 15, 2014",4,"When I started playing Dota 2 I absolutely hated it. I refused to play it. No one could convince me to go through the pain and suffering of repeatedly dying, being outplayed by everyone and the abuse that came with those performances. During The International 3, I decided to make an effort to watch the tournament and it completely blew me away. Orange tearing through the Losers Bracket, taking out DK and pushing towards the finals. The commentators were going wild, I had absolutely no idea what was actually going on but I knew it was epic. This brought me back to the game. We're now in the middle of The International 4 a n entire year later, I now have over 700 hours played and almost 450 games listed on my Dotabuff.Dota 2 is like an abusive relationship. It's a genuinely great game, competitive gaming at its near finest. When you do well you feel fantastic, you've earned it - you outplayed and outsmarted the opponents. You'll have games you won't forget about with big performances and dramatic team fights. But there are games that will haunt you due to ferocious emotional abuse from team mates. These games don't end quickly, you can be harassed for half an hour during a slow and painful loss. The community isn't as bad as other MOBAs, but it's very easy to blame other people. If you win, people will sing your praises through the game. If you lose, and if you're a support like myself - prepare yourself.I've played a fair amount of MOBAs, from League of Legends and HoN to the more abstract Awesomenauts and Smashmuck Champions. Dota 2 has to be rated as the best. It's tactically sound, it's gorgeous to look at, the 100+ heroes are all interesting and challenging and the team synergy is there to be picked up on. You can win games by choosing a more aggressive or pushing lineup. Go for team fight heroes and combine to wipe out the opponents or make space for certain heroes to keep the game going for as long as possible and win late into the game. Games can range from 10 minute stomps to 75+ epics.The game mechanics are for your team to gain gold and experience from killing creeps and opponents, but also to deny gold and experience by denying creeps and team mates - killing them so they can't get the kill. Everything is tactical, where you go in the map, at which times, controlling vision, acquiring runes or when to defend and when to push for towers or ancients. This is again, why the entry point into the game is so difficult. There is a very steep learning curve. You also have a shop menu to work out which items you should buy to help your heroes in different ways. You will learn this with experience. I have put this much time, effort and stupidity into this game and I still don't know a lot of things about the game. I still don't fully understand what heroes counter which, and I don't have full understanding of some abilities or item builds. It takes time and patience.Dota 2. It's a game I grew to really appreciate, but still a game that can ruin your day in one disastrous game. The competitive scene is great and fully supported by the game developers, it's constantly updated with community created cosmetics, mini events or new heroes. And the only time that in-game purchases are required is for specialist things like team pennants, tournament passes or cosmetics for your courier or hero unlike that of other MOBAs that require you to earn or purchase heroes to have the chance to broaden your playing experience. Easily recommended, but just be wary and try to keep your team mates relaxed and mediate them during those bad losses. You can't win every game."

67,197.7,Recommended," July 20, 2014",4,"Dota 2 is a fps developed by bungie in 1998 for the nintendo 64. Its a game that presents itself as a point and click adventure, similarly to the ""best game of the year 10/10 - New york times"" Gone home, you play a young lesbian trying to find love, however the game presents multiple obstacles to keep you from achieveing your goal. The obstacles are mostly stuns and supressions that every playable champ in the game has access to, accept for surpressor who has access to a global ult that puts all his opponents into low prio but thats another story. The game also has access to cool cosmetic items that give players direct access to their facebook allowing everyone to see how vibrant and colorful their language is when losing an mmorpg. Dota 2 is also an amazing language software, on pare with Rosetta stone that allows players to learn multiple languages, including but not limited too, Russian, Mexican, Spanish, Burrito Burrito Taco, ecceterra. I would highly suggest this game to you and your friends, despite it being so over priced at 89.99 msrb, it is worth every penny.

156,744.5,Recommended," August 14, 2014",4,"Ok so its dota 2, The larges and most popular game on steam at the time of writing, If you dont have this game and you are an avid gamer. You will most likely pick up this game at some point, due to the fact that it is free, and well why not?From a Graphics point of view at maxed out on a GTX 660 easily it looks fantastic and that isnt even the best graphics card so the requirements arnt huge but much lower than that on budget PC with the worst graphics card ever and you might get a few people compaining about your *Wooden PC* increasing the time to load up into the game, and if worst comes to worse you can turn it to complete minium and I bet you that even if you laptop has one of the worst GPU's on the market you can eventually get it to run at a playable pace.From a gameplay point of view, as you can see I have spent well over 500 hours on this game so it must be pretty good and some other reviewers have spent from 1000 hours and above, the reason?Well there is 1 map that has a few variables that can change the game such as the runes, weather you get a good creep from the jungle to control and take on your enemies with. So 1 map you think hummm that must be pretty limited, well yes i would kind of agree with you but the fact is that becuase of the 100+ heros and many hero combinations and counters no game is the same with each game changing the way you play slightly depending the character you play, how you play it and who you are against and how they play it so the game does take a while to get old and even then having the same map means that you can really know it, like REALLY know it. How to do specific techneques and pulling creeps, where the enemy heros can see you and how to position yourself. So in that term the gameplay remains fun and interesting while still for players like me challenging.The Community: This is the one issue you get with this game some people are not very forgiving for your mistakes and there is a lot of anti-russian stuff, mainly because when you go to play on an English or US server and you get strange man shouting at you and your team in a strange language that no one on your team but him can understand, people get a little (to say the least) annoyed. Althrough the higher your battle rank and mmr (I will talk about that later) means that eventually you will get players who actually make an effort to co-ordinate with you.The Ranking system and how valve makes its money: So the game is free and so how does valve make its money? Well first let me explain the ranking system: Basicaly after each game you will recieve an ammount of battle points for you to increase your battle point level, each level you will recieve an item (I think) and acasionally you will be able to open a present to get free items, these items can also be dropped through luck randomaly to people at the end of the game. Valve also sells hero costumes in the dota store/in game shop these items will only change the look of your character and will not actualy affect the gameplay which I find very unique and means that there arnt huge pay to wins in the game which annoys me hugely when people make a good game and then make it pay to win. These costume items are very effective with the steam market allowing players to sell their items cheaply to other players but valve still profits of that by taking a transaction fee. Also due to the popular steam workshop players can submit their item designs to be avaliable in game and they will also get a cut of the money made which is a nice thing for new artists to make some money while having something to potentially put on a CV.Also when you reach a battle point rank of 13 you will unlock ranked matchmaking which will allow you to play games with other people of that level 13 and higher to increase your MMR with the top MMR being 7500 and bottom 0 (You really have to be bad to get 0) with 5000+ mmr being very high. MMR is for more serious players that want to really test their skills with others of that level, but on a down side note, 2000-2700 mmr is very hard to get past as there are people from all different abilities so that can be a little dificult to get past. but eventually with experience and a little luck you will get past and eventually be on the climb you your ability level.This concludes my review for dota with a few 10/10 statisticsAlso please consider taking a look at my youtube channel where there is some dota content and some help videos for new players:Graphics: 8.5/10Gameplay: 9/10Community: 6/10 As it gets better later onRanking/Progression System: 9/10"

28,"12,272.6",Recommended," December 31, 2015",4,"I've been playing Dota 2 since December 2011 and i really like most of the aspects of this game. Dota 2 is great for players who aim for competetive gaming but is equally good for casual gamers who play for the sole purpose of enjoyment. One of the features of dota 2 which i like the most is its ever-evolving ""Meta"" gameplay which changes from time to time. Just when u think you've figured out the meta, a new patch arrives and with it comes new sections to explore,learn and adapt to the changes. This changing metagame not only manages to keep the casual gamers entertained but also tends to reset the Professional Scene. A champion team who dominated the most of the tournaments on the previous patch may be quickly replaced by another team who adapted to the new changes of the recently released patch way faster as compared to the rest of the teams. The beauty of the game lies in its ever evolving nature. The more u learn about it, the more u fall in love with it. Recommended for all gamers who have a thing for strategy games or want to try out Dota 2 beacuse of its huge community."

237,"1,268.6",Not Recommended," March 15, 2015",4,"Dota 2 is beatiful, balanced and deep. But when it comes to recommending a multiplayer game, one has to consider the community as well. I simply cannot recommnend that a player begins to play Dota. Dota, more than any other game in steam, is full of losers with something to prove. They need to win and, everytime they lose, they treat their teammates like the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s that took that away from them.As a new player, you will suck. Everybody knows it because everyone has been there. But in dota, unlike almost any other game on steam, new players are verbally abused systematically. They are bullied into quitting matches (so the newbie gets the penalty for quitting while the true quitter doesn't). Most of the time there will be someone who thinks that ""report for being a noob"" is a thing, even though they have to abuse the report system to make it happen. On rare occasions, you will meet a friedlier person that will try to teach you something. It will only take a couple mistakes for him to turn on you, after he sees that his expert advice didn't turn you into a pro in 5 minutes.As you get more experienced, you will start to realise that it is actually worse. The people who flame were never good either. They usually have little to no understanding of what wins a match. Flamers just attack people who didn't read their minds and didn't play according a secret rulebook, which they alone know. Not even good players are safe from noob flamers. The trully skilled players keep to themselves, either because they understand it's just a game, or because they've been punished too much already.Maybe you have a thick skin and you all of that seems irrelevant. Afterall, Dota 2 is a great game and you can give it a try at no cost. However, having experienced this antisocial community, I cannot honestly recommend that a new player begins playing Dota 2.Dota 2 700 update: I'm not the one to whine about change. I usually enjoy change just for the sake of change. However, this update of Dota displays something, which used to be below Valve: a rushed and broken release. Right now, Valve is releasing multiple rushed updates per day, fixing one thing and breaking another. When they do get normal matches straight again, then there will be the mods and bot matches, which are currently a complete and chaotic disaster. Clearly, testing and communication is minimal within Valve, which leads us to the question: should you trust Valve to deliver a stable and consistent game? Not anymore, I think. So, if the community is toxic and the game is unreliable, how could someone convince to play Dota?"

After Dota, it feels like every other game turns to ash when I try to partake.This game is so incredibly good. After 4000+ games, I still have not played the same game twice, yet I still expect every single game in the future to play out differently. The dynamics of item builds, map movement, hero selection, team fights, objectives, mind games, and teamwork all make it such that no one could ever play a perfect game. The eSports aspect of the game is booming and it fuels careers for many talented players, and it also produces very high quality viewing content and exciting storylines/games. The game is constantly patched and improved by Valve, and, most of all, it's free.This game has everything. It can satisfy the urge for being rewarded for mechanical skill and unit control that you find in an RTS. It will satisfy the level-up and hero/item building urge that you sate in an MMO or similar RPG. It will satisfy the quech for teamwork, game sense, and area/map awareness that you get out of any sport. It will provide the common spectator something great to enjoy from the sidelines. It's honestly possible to play one single hero every game and that is still more entertaining and fulfilling than some other popular games. There is a reason why the majority of Dota players have 4 digit hours of play time. There is always something to keep improving. At some points, you might find yourself noticing that someone is bad and learning that they ""only"" have 2,000 hours played.There is not any pay-to-win BS in Dota, either. Any time you load into a game, the things that separate you from your opponent are your skill and your experience. Nothing that can be purchased or acquired as a bonus will ever be able to give you an in-game advantage.The only thing is, since this game is so good, I have such a hard time enjoying any other game. Everything else can feel inferior in some way, whether it's because the game will feel like a chore or because the game's mechanics don't feel fun. It would be as if I discovered the perfect sandwich place and couldn't ever eat anywhere else without thinking about or comparing it to the food from that sandwich place. In some aspects, it even extends beyond video games. The skillful nature of this game satisfies the urge in me that previously got me to play piano since 2002.It's a shame that our generation is moving towards easier/lazier access and depth to games and other indulgent medias. League of Legends was founded on the ideals that Dota was too deep/complicated, so they wanted to remove all of the things that made it ""too hard or complex"", which is why it has more players. More people have picked up League of Legends because it's simple and doesn't have the ""burden of knowledge"";however, people that have stuck around know that Dota has a lot to learn, but it has infinite depth. It is completely worth your time and you'll be awestruck at the intricacy and beauty of Dota when everything comes together.I think that's the only way to describe how good this game really is. There is a reason that Dota isn't a game you play; it's a way of life. People might talk about how much in their life has changed since 2005, but there's always been Dota (it is interesting). Once you play this game, you will never see any other game the same way again."

68,"1,502.7",Recommended," August 25, 2014",4,"Dota 2 is a first person MMO RPG survival horror game developed by EA and EA only where you have to fight to survive in the drunken robot zombie apocalypse with nothing but your bare feet, as your hands are too pre-occupied taking off your panties in excitement for this sick filth.The main protagonist is you, Jakob. You are a lone survivor and every other player in the entire damn universe is an enemy. Jakob's model really matches his personality. A hipster, emo, gothic sex-driven male paired with the voice acting of Morgan Freeman really make this character pop out and helps make him really relatable.The storyline is great. I love how the developers have a completely separate ""prologue"" chapter for the story, explaining how such an apocalypse could have ever risen from the deep depths of hell (that's not a spoiler as you see that in the first 15 minutes of the game). You start out in the middle of Россия... er, Russia, spending time with your beloved family, and find out you are really, REALLY attracted to your cousin. You take her out to ""show her the world"" when suddenly a crack opens from the ground beneath you. Your cousin falls into the crevice. You are devastated. You try to rush home, but then all of a sudden, you hear a big шлеп... er, plop. You look behind you, and there are robot zombies, all drinking vodka. You then turn all around and find yourself surrounded. And I'll stop there, otherwise I may end up spoiling the prologue!The PvP in this game is SPOT ON. It's like the developers KNOW that you're the main character and give you the most overpowered arsenal right from the get-go! It's brilliant, need I say more? Fine, I shall! Just like the amazingness that was Dungeon Keeper Mobile, you too can attain the most powerful arsenal by slamming your wallet into EA's pockets! It's fantastic!The best part too? It's бесплатно--free. Если вы грязная американская свинья, кто не любит водку, то вы позор. Um, what I meant to say was ""It doesn't even cost a dime!""Overall I would say this game is a 10/10, a must-have game. EA has really shown how to create such a game. I'm just waiting on the DLC to come out later since, surprisingly, there was no day-one DLC."

618,352.1,Recommended," May 25, 2016",4,"This review may cover both DOTA games, DOTA 1 and DOTA 2.DOTA 2, in my perspective, is just a rework of its original game, DOTA 1. I have played DOTA 1 for more than 2 years before transferring to DOTA 2. However, I only played this game because I thought it was far better than the previous game.It is, but it's partly not.-Gameplay-The gameplay is just like any most other MOBA games out there that involves communication, skill, and the ability to play the game itself. Personally, I have been a fan of MOBA games back then because MOBA games are quite easy to learn, and its fun.Before moving to DOTA 2, the gameplay on DOTA 1 is easy to understand, because graphics back then were as simple and easy to understand, and I got into it pretty fast. DOTA 2 on the other hand, has better graphics, and the game was far more easier than before. In DOTA 2, the gameplay is shorter, because of how fast-paced the game is, compared to DOTA 1 which requires right timing to actually execute a good play.But they are still the same game that lets you farm creeps, level up your hero, kill the enemy team, and win.Not to mention, DOTA 1 needed a third-party software to play online (at least in other countries) while in DOTA 2, its just download, install, and play.-Controls-DOTA 2 basically has the same controls as DOTA 1, but it has the option to let you customize to your preference. You can now assign different hotkeys for every button that you can use for your hero and the menu. Back in DOTA 1, all hotkeys were quite fixed until you use another third-party software to modify them.-Community-Well, its like in any other MOBA games out there, it's either the community is good, or bad. But honestly, what really makes the DOTA 2 fall currently is the rise of toxicity among players. Since the game is free, more and more players are creating more accounts that lets them play whenever they want if one of their account is banned.-Other Things-Since DOTA 2 is a Valve software, you can actually make money by playing the game. The game has an inventory system that lets you store a certain hero's piece of equipment, or tools that lets you customize those equipment, and even tickets that enables you to watch a certain tournament in DOTA 2 itself. (I still watch on Twitch though.) With these items that you can receive through game drops, you can actually sell it in the community market for Steam Wallet. You can also make more of the items you get by trading with other players.Also, DOTA 2 has its own workshop, which you can visit to check out other gamemodes/maps made by other players in the DOTA 2 community.(Back in DOTA 1, you can only download the maps made by others.) Certain players in the community also create/design new items which can be implemented into the game if the proposed item was approved by players and the developers.-Final notes-Although DOTA 2 is a great game, it has it drawbacks specifically the community, which makes DOTA 2 itself. I mean, how do you play this game without players, right? Even so, its generally fun, especially with your friends.DOTA 2 is hard, but there's a huge reward to those who commit.I recommend this game to people who like multiplayer/MOBA games. I guarantee you, its worth it despite the troubles it might bring."
161,121.6,Recommended," May 27, 2016",4,"Product received for freeHands Down! This is generally the best Moba I've ever played in my entire life! No joke xD. I've played another Moba like LoL or specifically League Of Legends but quit it since I was so bad. This Moba is specifically about pushing, ganking, cooperation, teamwork, dedication, and sportsmanship. I really love the players, and people in this game, they're nice and give people nice directions even though the people who are given directions are new and bad at the game. To be honest, I too was once a bad player when I started playing Moba. But you just get better as you keeping playing the same old Moba game.Specifically these are methods to help you become better in the game.Pushing - Here's a quick tip on how this works. So you're in a game and each one of you are in your base. Basically the game goes 5 v 5. You order all your teammates or basically they're heroes to a single lane. Lanes are top, mid, or bottom. I basically go mid because it's more narrower and smaller space allowing you to push more faster. As you 5 push through a line, you basically have the advantage to give call outs and kill heroes together. Pushing is a really effective method on gaining an advantage early so that your heroes become stronger in the late or end game.Boons - Ahh, these are really nice and very good to use, Boons appear on the very right and left side of the rivers between the middle lane. Boons usually appear 1 - 2 minutes. These give different buffs to your heroes such as Bounty, Arcane, Invisibility, and Double Damage. Bounty grants you extra Exp and Gold. Arcane gramts you reduced Cooldown and Mana. Invisibility grants your hero to become invisible and be hidden from the map radar. Lastly, Double Damage increases your damage by a 100%. Getting Double Damage early will highly give you an advantage in early game. Just keep in mind, that it's highly necessary to get boons in the start of the game. They really help! Just trust me xD. :)Ok, well those are specific methods I've used to become better in Dota 2. IF you're a newbie or haven't played Moba before, just look up guides, builds, and search on the internet Dota 2 heroes for beginners. Good luck and have fun guys in Dota 2! :)"

The skillful nature of this game satisfies the urge in me that previously got me to play piano since 2002.It's a shame that our generation is moving towards easier/lazier access and depth to games and other indulgent medias. League of Legends was founded on the ideals that Dota was too deep/complicated, so they wanted to remove all of the things that made it ""too hard or complex"", which is why it has more players. More people have picked up League of Legends because it's simple and doesn't have the ""burden of knowledge"";however, people that have stuck around know that Dota has a lot to learn, but it has infinite depth. It is completely worth your time and you'll be awestruck at the intricacy and beauty of Dota when everything comes together.I think that's the only way to describe how good this game really is. There is a reason that Dota isn't a game you play; it's a way of life. People might talk about how much in their life has changed since 2005, but there's always been Dota (it is interesting). Once you play this game, you will never see any other game the same way again."

The map is confusing as well as the character's attributes and the different characters are unbalanced. In my opinion it got less User friendly and it is even harder for beginners to get used to the game.By the way I have played Dota 2 for 3.000 hours over 3 years and seen many updates that greatly changed the game, but this update made the ""good old"" Dota 2 to a complete different game."

Further more my loading screens and paid UI's are now obsolete, thanks for thanking my money and giving me this new crap ...7.07 is full of unbalanced heroes but it can be fun to see the bugs and how the new abilities act in certain new conditions."

I'd say the talent tree addition is a good move forward however it certianly could use some more work. Also the backpack addition is decent, it removes some of the higher skill play when it comes to destroying items... but it's not a terrible addition.But that's about it for the ""pros"". The new map is a joke, a complete farse. 2 minute respawn times for camps removes the ability to make effective stacks and the fountian in the jungle removes all challenge to jungling - unless the enemy team is dedicated to harassing you, and even then you'll still have an almost full healing every 5 minutes.The ui changes are nothing more than a straight downgrade from before, guides suffer particularly. Instead of having a dedicated tab it now is thrown into the shop tab, which for some reason, valve decide to make harder to navigate.All in all, Dota 7.00 has an identity problem, it doesn't know if it wants to be Dota 6.89, League, or Heroes of the Storm. At this point I'd say League is better if you're looking for a hardcore experience, Heroes of the Storm if you're not. Dota right now is painfully mediocre."

67,197.7,Recommended," July 20, 2014",4,"Dota 2 is a fps developed by bungie in 1998 for the nintendo 64. Its a game that presents itself as a point and click adventure, similarly to the ""best game of the year 10/10 - New york times"" Gone home, you play a young lesbian trying to find love, however the game presents multiple obstacles to keep you from achieveing your goal. The obstacles are mostly stuns and supressions that every playable champ in the game has access to, accept for surpressor who has access to a global ult that puts all his opponents into low prio but thats another story. The game also has access to cool cosmetic items that give players direct access to their facebook allowing everyone to see how vibrant and colorful their language is when losing an mmorpg. Dota 2 is also an amazing language software, on pare with Rosetta stone that allows players to learn multiple languages, including but not limited too, Russian, Mexican, Spanish, Burrito Burrito Taco, ecceterra. I would highly suggest this game to you and your friends, despite it being so over priced at 89.99 msrb, it is worth every penny. Dota 2 is also the only good video game to come out in the last 28 years and will stay that way for years to come, and thats how i spent my summer vacation - ferris bueller"

618,352.1,Recommended," May 25, 2016",4,"This review may cover both DOTA games, DOTA 1 and DOTA 2.DOTA 2, in my perspective, is just a rework of its original game, DOTA 1. I have played DOTA 1 for more than 2 years before transferring to DOTA 2. However, I only played this game because I thought it was far better than the previous game.It is, but it's partly not.-Gameplay-The gameplay is just like any most other MOBA games out there that involves communication, skill, and the ability to play the game itself. Personally, I have been a fan of MOBA games back then because MOBA games are quite easy to learn, and its fun.Before moving to DOTA 2, the gameplay on DOTA 1 is easy to understand, because graphics back then were as simple and easy to understand, and I got into it pretty fast. DOTA 2 on the other hand, has better graphics, and the game was far more easier than before. In DOTA 2, the gameplay is shorter, because of how fast-paced the game is, compared to DOTA 1 which requires right timing to actually execute a good play.But they are still the same game that lets you farm creeps, level up your hero, kill the enemy team, and win.Not to mention, DOTA 1 needed a third-party software to play online (at least in other countries) while in DOTA 2, its just download, install, and play.-Controls-DOTA 2 basically has the same controls as DOTA 1, but it has the option to let you customize to your preference. You can now assign different hotkeys for every button that you can use for your hero and the menu. Back in DOTA 1, all hotkeys were quite fixed until you use another third-party software to modify them.-Community-Well, its like in any other MOBA games out there, it's either the community is good, or bad. But honestly, what really makes the DOTA 2 fall currently is the rise of toxicity among players. Since the game is free, more and more players are creating more accounts that lets them play whenever they want if one of their account is banned.-Other Things-Since DOTA 2 is a Valve software, you can actually make money by playing the game. The game has an inventory system that lets you store a certain hero's piece of equipment, or tools that lets you customize those equipment, and even tickets that enables you to watch a certain tournament in DOTA 2 itself. (I still watch on Twitch though.) With these items that you can receive through game drops, you can actually sell it in the community market for Steam Wallet. You can also make more of the items you get by trading with other players.Also, DOTA 2 has its own workshop, which you can visit to check out other gamemodes/maps made by other players in the DOTA 2 community.(Back in DOTA 1, you can only download the maps made by others.) Certain players in the community also create/design new items which can be implemented into the game if the proposed item was approved by players and the developers.-Final notes-Although DOTA 2 is a great game, it has it drawbacks specifically the community, which makes DOTA 2 itself. I mean, how do you play this game without players, right? Even so, its generally fun, especially with your friends.DOTA 2 is hard, but there's a huge reward to those who commit.I recommend this game to people who like multiplayer/MOBA games. I guarantee you, its worth it despite the troubles it might bring."

161,121.6,Recommended," May 27, 2016",4,"Product received for freeHands Down! This is generally the best Moba I've ever played in my entire life! No joke xD. I've played another Moba like LoL or specifically League Of Legends but quit it since I was so bad. This Moba is specifically about pushing, ganking, cooperation, teamwork, dedication, and sportsmanship. I really love the players, and people in this game, they're nice and give people nice directions even though the people who are given directions are new and bad at the game. To be honest, I too was once a bad player when I started playing Moba. But you just get better as you keeping playing the same old Moba game.Specifically these are methods to help you become better in the game.Pushing - Here's a quick tip on how this works. So you're in a game and each one of you are in your base. Basically the game goes 5 v 5. You order all your teammates or basically they're heroes to a single lane. Lanes are top, mid, or bottom. I basically go mid because it's more narrower and smaller space allowing you to push more faster. As you 5 push through a line, you basically have the advantage to give call outs and kill heroes together. Pushing is a really effective method on gaining an advantage early so that your heroes become stronger in the late or end game.Boons - Ahh, these are really nice and very good to use, Boons appear on the very right and left side of the rivers between the middle lane. Boons usually appear 1 - 2 minutes. These give different buffs to your heroes such as Bounty, Arcane, Invisibility, and Double Damage. Bounty grants you extra Exp and Gold. Arcane gramts you reduced Cooldown and Mana. Invisibility grants your hero to become invisible and be hidden from the map radar. Lastly, Double Damage increases your damage by a 100%. Getting Double Damage early will highly give you an advantage in early game. Just keep in mind, that it's highly necessary to get boons in the start of the game. They really help! Just trust me xD. :)Ok, well those are specific methods I've used to become better in Dota 2. IF you're a newbie or haven't played Moba before, just look up guides, builds, and search on the internet Dota 2 heroes for beginners. Good luck and have fun guys in Dota 2! :)"

237,"1,268.6",Not Recommended," March 15, 2015",4,"Dota 2 is beatiful, balanced and deep. But when it comes to recommending a multiplayer game, one has to consider the community as well. I simply cannot recommnend that a player begins to play Dota. Dota, more than any other game in steam, is full of losers with something to prove. They need to win and, everytime they lose, they treat their teammates like the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s that took that away from them.As a new player, you will suck. Everybody knows it because everyone has been there. But in dota, unlike almost any other game on steam, new players are verbally abused systematically. They are bullied into quitting matches (so the newbie gets the penalty for quitting while the true quitter doesn't). Most of the time there will be someone who thinks that ""report for being a noob"" is a thing, even though they have to abuse the report system to make it happen. On rare occasions, you will meet a friedlier person that will try to teach you something. It will only take a couple mistakes for him to turn on you, after he sees that his expert advice didn't turn you into a pro in 5 minutes.As you get more experienced, you will start to realise that it is actually worse. The people who flame were never good either. They usually have little to no understanding of what wins a match. Flamers just attack people who didn't read their minds and didn't play according a secret rulebook, which they alone know. Not even good players are safe from noob flamers. The trully skilled players keep to themselves, either because they understand it's just a game, or because they've been punished too much already.Maybe you have a thick skin and you all of that seems irrelevant. Afterall, Dota 2 is a great game and you can give it a try at no cost. However, having experienced this antisocial community, I cannot honestly recommend that a new player begins playing Dota 2.Dota 2 700 update: I'm not the one to whine about change. I usually enjoy change just for the sake of change. However, this update of Dota displays something, which used to be below Valve: a rushed and broken release. Right now, Valve is releasing multiple rushed updates per day, fixing one thing and breaking another. When they do get normal matches straight again, then there will be the mods and bot matches, which are currently a complete and chaotic disaster. Clearly, testing and communication is minimal within Valve, which leads us to the question: should you trust Valve to deliver a stable and consistent game? Not anymore, I think. So, if the community is toxic and the game is unreliable, how could someone convince to play Dota?"

174,"2,532.7",Not Recommended," February 4, 2015",22,"I dont usually write reviews but this is a game that I played really much because I enjoy the genre and tried many games in it to compare DotA 2 with. Basically in terms of speed DotA 2, along with Strife (which is basically DotA 2 in graphics style of LoL with a pet+item system which you can level up by playing) is average, so if you think a MOBA should be slower you should try League of Legends and if you think it should be faster you should try Heroes of Newerth. If you are looking for an alternative that is less knowledge based you should probably try Heroes of the Storm, since you dont have to learn as many item effects.DotA 2 in a ""nutshell"" after ~2400h of playtime:-New players (if interested in cosmetic items) will have to visit the shop now because game drops have become so incredibly rare that it has become hilarious.-IF you buy item chests in the shop and dont get the set you bought it for, you can't sell the items since volvo put a trade+market cooldown (2 months I think) on every new item that gets released (yay!) so if you dont want to spend money until you have each possible drop from that single chest (RNG is strong in this one) you're better off waiting until the desired item is marketable and then buy it off the market.-Volvo greed simulator: The old loot system, in which you could acutally gain items after a game ,for DotA 2 profile levels, and a leveling chest you had in your inventory (which could be opened every few profile levels and contained a new chest to open later) was successfully reworked into greed-mode. The chances to get ANY items after a game are as low as getting a legendary (or higher) before. Sure they drop ENTIRE sets now, but most of them are common to rare, which overall is still less rewards than before if you add up singe items and put them up against the set drop chance now in both, item quantity AND value. Maybe you should try some ""never change a running system"" in this particular function.-Mostly developer/support abandoned game. the new content this game releases is mostly made by the community since the hero sets are workshop based and hero releases/patches are just really really rare. Special events are mostly the same every year and the report system is most likely 100% count-based/not reviewed by support employées (for example if you express your annoyance towards...lets say russians...for not being able to communicate in english on EU servers, you will most likely end up muted because out of the 10 players in a EU game 3 (probably more) are most likely russian and will report you for speaking english)-These days russian-infested to the max...8/10 games you play will result in eyecancer due to russian chatspam, even though they have their own servers(!) because its way cooler to go to international servers and spam your native language, thanks volvo for letting that happen! maybe one day the EU servers will be renamed into russia 2 and russia 3 and the actual EU will have to play on american servers after all :D*EDIT*-In addition to the listed issues, the game servers are now absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥ 1/4-1/5 of the games crash and are not counted due to connection issues with the servers, great job of making it even worse when ppl thought that wasn't possible...Conclusion: If you want to play a game in which you get rewarded for playing (in terms of cosmetic effects and/or profile progression) this probably is not the right choice anymore, because as stated you don't get level rewards or similar stuff anymore, just REALLY rare item drops (probably in the 0,2% range).If you want to blow off some steam with trolling other players, spamming your native language while being sure nobody will be able to understand you this might probably be YOUR gamechoice #1. The community these days is mostly toxic and troll based so this is NOT your game for some serious gametime (at least not in solo matchmaking).I didnt check the other games these days but the community in HoN was much more friendly and less russian.In my personal opinion DotA 2 isn't playable solo anymore because there is too few games where you can actually play properly, without being annoyed by trolls or russians...Gameplay/Balance: 9/10Community: 2,5/10Rewards System: 1/10"

636,"3,513.0",Not Recommended," December 20, 2016",225,"Dota 2 was a fantastic game but for some reason, probably the greed of appealing to a wider audience, the devs decided to copy elements from League of Legends and Heroes of the Storm. It's great an all that they tried to ""improve"" the game, but they fail to understand why people choose to play Dota 2 over the others.League of Legends is distinct enough to stand on it's own and have it's fans.Heroes of the Storm is distinct enough to have it's own fans.Dota 2 WAS distinct enough to have it's own fans.People will always have a favourite flavour of MOBA, just like people have their favourite flavour of icecream.Now after 7.00 though, Dota 2 looks more like the rest, it's lost part of it's distinction and it's became a weaker game looking more like an amalgamation of the others. Our vanilla Dota that we've all enjoyed for years has been discontinued and is replaced with this neopolitan stuff.I just can't enjoy this game anymore, the changes are too far from what that glorious golden heart of Dota was and the garbage new HUD doesn't help. It's got way less information, it takes longer to see it, plus important information like ♥♥♥♥ing health and mana is further away from where your eyes rest. Terrible.So great were the map changes that even the Dota 2 logo isn't even accurate anymore, it used to represent the two ancients with the river in between, now it needs that Roshan island in the middle."
88,"6,051.7",Not Recommended," September 19, 2017",286,"TLDR version: !!Do not even consider installing this game!! Toxic pile of dung. (edit2: Just had an indept discussion with one of the homophobic sweethearts that play the game.. read the comments to see what to expect in-game tenfold..)If you want some details:I played enough hours to be able to tell you that this game has the most TOXIC community I have ever encountered in any game.I love(d) dota, been playing it since dota1 as a customgame in WC3, was very happy dota2 came into excistence. But lately the toxicity has reached levels of never before.As of now I am selling all my items, never intending to play this game ever again. The game has been taken over by russians and turks (monolingual people make teamplay nearly impossible), two of the most rude and unsocial people on earth. The reporting system only works against you because the monolingual narrow minded turds will stick up for eachother. So if you play support and the enemy dewards, its your fault and thus you get reported. Or if enemy team has Nightstalker and they can't see then it's your fault as well that wards dont work. Either way you're ♥♥♥♥ed if you play support - it's always your fault. So ♥♥♥♥ing toxic this game. I am so done with this game. Spent hundreds of euros on it, but they (developers) rather make it appealing to people who don't know how to be social or teamplay. So here it is, my final review, I am selling all my stuff, the last few euro's you'll make of me. The game itself is beautiful, but it's really not worth it if you have to put up with this toxic community that they wish to keep intact with this failing report system.Reports mean evertything, commends mean nothing.I get commended 40 times, doesnt mean♥♥♥♥♥♥against the 7 times I get reported. Then I get low Priority. I fail to see the logic in that. I am done with this game. (numbers may be exagerated but you get my point.)And yes, there is an option to mute people that don't speak English or that are rude - thing is that won't stop them from trying to get everyone to report you just because you didn't heal them in time that one time, or that your shallow grave spell isn't a mapwide castable. And power is in repetition, these toxic kids will be very persuasive and promise commends in return for reports. (people who agree to that are probably even worse than the toxic kid that promises it.)Bloody shame though, been playing Dota since the very beginning when it was just a custom game on WC3, too bad seeing it go to♥♥♥♥♥♥because of a worthless reportsystem that seeminlgy only makes the game even more toxic instead of making it a better place."

It's like that.You can't surrender or leave their games because their client punishes you, so you're forced to play it out with the little gremlins.To add insult to injury, there's no convincing stalemate breaking mechanic. Sometimes you get both teams jungling and unwilling to force a win, despite one team being impossibly ahead... for up to 2 hours.Lastly, it was hard to find people to play with. I had to unfriend most of the guys I've met for turning into rabid monsters at whichever teammate first made mistakes (or was nearby).I just wish it wasn't so awful to play with these guys, or that it didn't scare off every single irl gamer friend with its ""charm.""

I'm still not sure how or why it happened but i do enjoy playing Dota and sometimes i even play vs people, even though it makes me want to cry or yell in rage.There are few major issues with Dota 2 at the moment:1) Absence of communication between developers and players. Dev forums seem to exist only for players, since thousands of bugs (especially cosmetic ones) and suggestions simply remain ignored.2) Infrequent content updates and lack of features. They could've at least allowed us to play game modes from different events to diversify gameplay or added new maps, instead they keep focusing on adding new cosmetic items. 9 out of 10 updates only include ""hats"". Game folder keeps growing but nothing changes gameplay-wise. They even stopped adding new bots to my favourite game mode.3) Constant server side issues which they can't fix. There are issues with downloading replays, reconnecting to games, watching matches, searching for games and even finishing matches without somebody getting crashes or disconnects.4) A lot of racism, swearing and general anger towards other players. Especially Russians. Report system is completely inadequate and doesn't help at all.I would recommend Dota 2 because its cute and well-thought game, with amazing voice-overs and excellent replayability. I do advise however against spending money in their store since once your start you cannot stop. This is probably how drug addiction works - they pull you in with free stuff and then you just want to complete a set, buy new items because of the modified effects, gamble for a chance to get some common item which would later cost hundreds of dollars (valve deliberately removes some items to drive up prices), find some unusual courier which could easily compensate all of your spendings... or plunge yourself into poverty if you get unlucky with chests."

81,"4,674.9",Recommended," December 22, 2014",7,"I play DotA since it was a Warcraft III custom map. The matchmaking in DotA 1 was completely random - anyone could join your room! This way it was hard to improve your skills playing. Now, past 2 years DotA 2 has been released, the matchmaking became much better (their system 'wants' you to win 50% and lose the other 50%). 90% of all I know about DotA I learned in DotA 2 - mechanics, strategies and some details.What do I think about the game?Pros:-> DotA 2 have a steep, daunting learning curve. You can't just be a good DotA 2 player with 100 games.. sometimes you'll have to get tips with friends, search strategies on google and watch competitive games. This can be fun and challenging.-> It's very fun when you play pub games with your friends and WIN the game. Otherwise.. heh-> Although it's always the same map and objective, there's a lot of combination and strategy plays you can do ! (more than 100 heroes).-> If you like MOBA/RTS game, when you spend a lot of time in DotA 2 and learn advanced plays you'll not stop playing. Well, I do not know if it's a good or bad thing!Cons:-> DotA 2 is a RTS (Real Time Strategy) 5x5 game, so it's very frustating when you play with people you do not like.-> It does not have a good tutorial explaining all the advanced plays.. you'll have to learn by yourself or by a friend. You can search on forums too!-> It's very difficult in the beginning, if you do not have patience and time it will be a very difficult to play this game."

Each hero has unique abilities along with items to help you develop hero the way you want. Also you can try to mix skill combos with your friends. Various skins has been added for some heroes, and even some skins can be collected through events or matches. So what's the problem?The problem is community, Dota has the worst community comparing to the other games that I play, and it gets worst everyday. I am aware that Dota has commend and report system but it seems nothing to do with matchmaking algorithm, at least it should be use as parameter to help 'kind' player play along with another 'kind' player, and it goes same with the 'rude' players."

I can't even begin to imagine the environment when things start getting serious.It was a better experience praticing with bots as machines demonstrated better team spirit and they acted in a much more civilized fashion.If you are into trolling and flaming, insanely competitive playing, or if you are a sociopath, this is the game for you.Otherwise just avoid it like the plague.At the end this game is nothing but a glorified tower defense click click click waste of time anyway."

205,315.6,Not Recommended," December 26, 2016",5,"Launched the game, finished the tutorial and played a game with a friend on hard AI.Here is the review from the bottom of my heart:Hate to be vague, but it was no where near the quality of the other games I've played before. I felt as if each character repeated the same lackluster annoying voice over and over. Not to mention that a couple of games I decided to try a new hero (Which I of course had no idea how to play) and got stomped to hell.Hate to be cancer, but on a first glance, league is definitely more fun. In this case, League only gives you access to easy champions at the start, and you have to earn access to difficult champions.Quote from Dota2:""We believe restricting player access to heroes could be destructive to game design""This may seem legit at first, but the goal of unlocking heroes is critical to game progression, and keeping the player immersed into unlocking the champion they love. Sadly, when I was presented with a clusterf**k of heroes it made the game an instant turn off.Hate to be stupid, but this game is too confusing for new players like me. A summary of the things mentioned above, some may believe that i'm not cut out for these games. I believe so to be incorrect, I have easily 1v1ed golds in league, have years of RTS experience (Dawn of war II, Starcraft II, Starcraft). Its just when transitioning into such a difficult and unique MOBA, I start to suffer from the lack of direction.Could I have read online guides?YesCould I have played the characters I like only and not deal with new characters?YesCould I have not made this review?YesBut, the end result is that I decided to disregard all of those. A true game should still be able to shine through despite a lack of experience and no help (not to mention I already have years of previous experience). I can't vouch for that in the case of this game. In fact, I can't get over these flaws and have uninstalled the game.People can call me cancer, stupid, babyish and tell me to suck it up.Am I actually any of these?Most would say no, but my purpose here is not to change how you think.I am here to put my own personal review on the market to help others who actually want to know about the game.So, if your ARE new, please take some time into learning the easy characters so you don't have a morbid turn-off experience like I did."

I can't even begin to imagine the environment when things start getting serious.It was a better experience praticing with bots as machines demonstrated better team spirit and they acted in a much more civilized fashion.If you are into trolling and flaming, insanely competitive playing, or if you are a sociopath, this is the game for you.Otherwise just avoid it like the plague.At the end this game is nothing but a glorified tower defense click click click waste of time anyway."

402,1.9,Not Recommended," January 25, 2017",5,"Dota 2 is Valve's MOBA title, which is to say it's a real-time strategy game where you literally play the one single map over and over again, but you play as one of 700 characters that in other RTS games would be lategame units or lynchpins of a player's entire army, individual games can take hours, and also there's a shop/inventory system for some reason. Also, the lore depicts the battle represented in the game as a final cataclysm between good and evil that will destroy the world no matter who wins, which is amusing to think about considering how many times it's been played out by the game's millions of fans. As a couple of my friends put it, half the features are bugs that got left in because the dev liked them; it's a horrifying mess with a skill floor that starts where other games have a ceiling, and a skill ceiling that may or may not exist.Taken altogether, Dota 2 seems very much like a product of people who got so incredibly attached to one very particular experience that they built everything else around it - and this is the important part - warts and all. People apparently spend massive amounts of time and money on what is essentially a glorified Warcraft III mod that itself has many mods, though, so it at least proves the viability of game modding.This is also the product that's mainly responsible for killing the old Valve, the one that produced quality games time and again. Thanks to the massive popularity of Dota, and to an extent Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Valve are content to sit on their butts iterating on them while screwing around with VR and reaping that store/market/microtransaction money.I at least liked the snazzy main menu and the Half-Life 2 doot noises. Inclusion of the Counter-Strike AWP firing noise on the other hand just bewildered me."
562,6.3,Not Recommended," December 13, 2016",5,"I was a real fan of Dota back in the day. But somehow LoL improved upon the concept in my eyes, and they improved further with visibility, items, champions, etc. Even Hots is a competent game...in contrast DOTA 2 is just inferior imho. This is even post 7.00 patch, so I expected more. Some examples:- Snowball factor: Dying means losing gold, i.e. when you're behind, you can only get more behind. Sure, those playing better should be winning, but punishing those who are already losing even further is unnecessary. It was already flawed in DOTA to begin with and is in no way modern.- Visibility: There is no indicator as to how big the range of your spells is, only when you hover over them. I get that they want people to learn the range, but that does nothing to help players who are already pros, it punishes those that want to get into the game. It is, again, outdated design. You can also not quickly gauge the power level of your enemies. Their level for example is only displayed when you hover your mouse over them. Why? Again, showing that wouldn't punish anyone, but it makes the game more accessible and nicer to look at. Your own stats are also barely visible making it hard to see how powerful YOU are.- Shop: The shop is a mess, it's convoluted and unnecessary small fonted. Small items, small text, hard to understand. And that is coming from someone who has been playing Dota for ages (but not DOTA 2). The courier and the different shops are subjective really. That's just Dota. I don't really like it all that much, because all of that takes away from the actual gameplay. Not to mention that it again punishes those far behind, as it can be literally impossible to complete an item when you're behind, because you need to go to the middle of the map to buy the component. Or send the courier there, which can be killed. Speaking of components: How unsatisfying is it to have to buy a component for several hundred gold that adds NOTHING to your item, but you need it, because it ""combines"" the components into the actual item? Meh...- Pathing: ♥♥♥♥ me, the pathing is atrocious...if you thought HOTS had horrible pathing, don't play DOTA 2 as everyone will get in each other's way constantly.- Gameplay and graphics: These are mostly subjective anyway, but I find the gameplay to be painfully slow and not engaging. Spending gold on teleports, killing jungle monsters for whatever reason, last hitting and denying...denying is ok, why not, but I'm used to the fluid motions of LoL champions. DOTA 2 champs on the other hand feel like clunky Warcraft 3 Heroes...even those might have been more responsive. Even following your hero is not possible apparently, at least I find no key for that.The game simply lacks fluidity and visibility.

402,1.9,Not Recommended," January 25, 2017",5,"Dota 2 is Valve's MOBA title, which is to say it's a real-time strategy game where you literally play the one single map over and over again, but you play as one of 700 characters that in other RTS games would be lategame units or lynchpins of a player's entire army, individual games can take hours, and also there's a shop/inventory system for some reason. Also, the lore depicts the battle represented in the game as a final cataclysm between good and evil that will destroy the world no matter who wins, which is amusing to think about considering how many times it's been played out by the game's millions of fans. As a couple of my friends put it, half the features are bugs that got left in because the dev liked them; it's a horrifying mess with a skill floor that starts where other games have a ceiling, and a skill ceiling that may or may not exist.Taken altogether, Dota 2 seems very much like a product of people who got so incredibly attached to one very particular experience that they built everything else around it - and this is the important part - warts and all. People apparently spend massive amounts of time and money on what is essentially a glorified Warcraft III mod that itself has many mods, though, so it at least proves the viability of game modding.This is also the product that's mainly responsible for killing the old Valve, the one that produced quality games time and again. Thanks to the massive popularity of Dota, and to an extent Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Valve are content to sit on their butts iterating on them while screwing around with VR and reaping that store/market/microtransaction money.I at least liked the snazzy main menu and the Half-Life 2 doot noises. Inclusion of the Counter-Strike AWP firing noise on the other hand just bewildered me."
562,6.3,Not Recommended," December 13, 2016",5,"I was a real fan of Dota back in the day. But somehow LoL improved upon the concept in my eyes, and they improved further with visibility, items, champions, etc. Even Hots is a competent game...in contrast DOTA 2 is just inferior imho. This is even post 7.00 patch, so I expected more. Some examples:- Snowball factor: Dying means losing gold, i.e. when you're behind, you can only get more behind. Sure, those playing better should be winning, but punishing those who are already losing even further is unnecessary. It was already flawed in DOTA to begin with and is in no way modern.- Visibility: There is no indicator as to how big the range of your spells is, only when you hover over them. I get that they want people to learn the range, but that does nothing to help players who are already pros, it punishes those that want to get into the game. It is, again, outdated design. You can also not quickly gauge the power level of your enemies. Their level for example is only displayed when you hover your mouse over them. Why? Again, showing that wouldn't punish anyone, but it makes the game more accessible and nicer to look at. Your own stats are also barely visible making it hard to see how powerful YOU are.- Shop: The shop is a mess, it's convoluted and unnecessary small fonted. Small items, small text, hard to understand. And that is coming from someone who has been playing Dota for ages (but not DOTA 2). The courier and the different shops are subjective really. That's just Dota. I don't really like it all that much, because all of that takes away from the actual gameplay. Not to mention that it again punishes those far behind, as it can be literally impossible to complete an item when you're behind, because you need to go to the middle of the map to buy the component. Or send the courier there, which can be killed. Speaking of components: How unsatisfying is it to have to buy a component for several hundred gold that adds NOTHING to your item, but you need it, because it ""combines"" the components into the actual item? Meh...- Pathing: ♥♥♥♥ me, the pathing is atrocious...if you thought HOTS had horrible pathing, don't play DOTA 2 as everyone will get in each other's way constantly.- Gameplay and graphics: These are mostly subjective anyway, but I find the gameplay to be painfully slow and not engaging. Spending gold on teleports, killing jungle monsters for whatever reason, last hitting and denying...denying is ok, why not, but I'm used to the fluid motions of LoL champions. DOTA 2 champs on the other hand feel like clunky Warcraft 3 Heroes...even those might have been more responsive. Even following your hero is not possible apparently, at least I find no key for that.The game simply lacks fluidity and visibility.

350,"4,587.7",Recommended," November 25, 2017",33,"[ Update ]2018Recent update added ""Dota Plus"" (optional monthly subscription) replacing the old Major Battlepass system. I think it's become a little more pay to win, but only very slight. It gives you more detailed information, expanded the fight summary, and suggestions (common sense). For instance, in the picking phase and during the game such as team combination, which skill to level up first, which items to buy. Moreover, there is lifetime hero progression for each hero, you gain exp to level up each time you play and complete a hero quest as additional purpose to play. And also, now with reward system that lets you claim rewards for you favorite heroes. I think it is a good feature since if compared to the old battlepass system, it's cheaper overrall the progressions and rewards that don't expire like in the old battlepass system.[ Some thoughts ]I feel like the new hero progression for Dota Plus players encourages players to spam thier favorite heroes to get leveled up (which can be good or bad). I guess there will be more exclusive hero sets for all heroes soon. So anyway, you can save up the coins and purchase them."

The game works like this ,that there are two teams, first team is called ""Radiant"", second team is called ""Dire"" and each team will have a base, that base is called ""Ancient"", then to win this game you have to destroy there base. So basically the first one to destroy the enemy's ancient wins, but before that you must go through the enemy's towers, there's three tower on each lane, so you can't destroy their ancient if you don't destroy the three towers and you cant advance to the second tower or third tower, you must destroy the first, second and third then finally their ancient. Last thing is , each team will have five players so you and your teammate must cooperate if not you guys will lose instantly the game, then each player will have a to pick a their role. There are 10 roles. After you guys pick a roles. There will be three lanes there's ""Mid"", ""Top"", and ""Bottom"". So it can be like this 1 in the mid, 2 at the top and 2 at the bottom.10 RolesCarry - will bring victory if he levels up faster and makes gold faster.Support - will provide wards and courier, also will upgrade the courier.Lane Support - useful even without farm and can go to other lanes to help othersInitiator - will start the teamfight.Jungle - can get gold in the jungle so the other teammate can solo top/bottom.This the common role in game, if you have this team you have 50/50 chance of winningI hope you like it and I really recommend this game, so good luck and had fun :)Pls like my review"

A game with a massive learning curve that requires nothing apart from your game knowledge and good habits to excel at.Don't get into this game if you're not willing to learn a lot or sacrifice plenty of your time.Once you reach a high skill level, you understand the game at its core and you also find the right people to play with this game is the most enjoyable game you can possibly play. That is if you have the patience to get there.The community is great overall, the game is flawless. Valve is doing a great job with this one.Competitive scene is the healthiest I've seen, and I've watched countless competitive matches. So damn entertaining.Just look at this!YouTube™ Video: Alliance vs Na'Vi Grand Championship 5 of 5 English Commentary Views: 2,624,422Now what has changed ever since I written the review back in 2013?Well, the new client has been ported that offers better things on the interface and support aspect and brings in new things like a slew of Custom Games you can play apart from Dota2. This game started originally as a mod for Warcraft III and I'm happy to see it has gone full circle to such an extent that the original W3 can be made entirely in the Dota2 client.As a flagship Valve game, you can expect bright things in the future, as the competitive scene flourishes.The only answer is: Do you want to play a moba?If you like:- free games- polished games- playing with a team- playing with friends- cosmetics & spending money for them- hard games- e-sportsIf you are okay with:- spending a lot of time playing games- learning a lot of complicated things- getting yelled at by russiansThen Dota2 is a game for you."

If there's an actual problem in the match, you aren't allowed to address it or play around it without being flagged as toxic, even if you've been a big team motivator. These people are so comitted to 'positivity' they want Dota to be a safe space where any communication that's not 'well played' is reportable.I've secured almost as many commends as I have games (about 2k each), and I can tell you, it doesn't do much in the way of securing you 'better' teammates. Actually, it's the opposite. Generally I get matched with new players on my team, who don't want to learn the game, and take item suggestions as toxic communication. The enemy team isn't always new when these games happen. Often I get teams with profiles that match mine (upward of 80-120) stacking the enemy team.This system doesn't help new players, and it doesn't help people that want to get better at the game.I get the whole ""Get good"" attitude of Dota is one of the draws, but it's time for a change. I've gotten fairly good. I can adequately play just about every hero (except beast master, just retire him guys). I can play just about any role. I keep up with my high MMR friends, but it doesn't seem to matter.In order to 'have fun' in the game, as in, not get flamed, or blasted by toxic players, it's like that movie War Games, where the only way to win is to not play.I love Dota. And I think it still has a few years of life left in it. But It's going to fizzle hard, and I think we're starting to see some splitting at the seams.

Alot of time and concentration must be invested into this vast experience that can define the lives of many individuals. The training system in this game or tutorial if u must only teaches the absolute basics: such as how to move around or how to attack and use your various abilities.

Numerous times i swore i wanna quit this rage-generator and even more times i found hope that i could simply ""git gud"". It wouldn't happen. I cant win 1v5 in my skill bracket and i cant endure this mess to pass higher, so it only brings needless frustration again and again.

3,"1,244.3",Recommended," October 31, 2017",3,"Close the game, delete steam, burn your computer, welcome to DOTA! Dota (defense of the ancients) is a game with a fairly interesting history, starting life as a 5v5 competitive map mod for warcraft 3 before various team members splitting off to try and re-create the magic in stand alone games. Gameplay visually has the look of an RTS albeit with you only having one unit but mechanically it is vastly different and you will have people yelling at you if you try and play dota 2 like an RTS. There is an extensive hero roster ensuring games stay dynamic and the game receives constant balance tweaks. The multiplayer match making functions well and the recent addition of an in game mod manager for alternative game modes and maps in yet another welcome addition. For me, Dota 2 represents the most crushed I've ever felt after playing a game and also the most elated I've felt. It's just that broad of a range and when it's good it's so so good.-super fun. The feeling of turning around a game that you have slowly been loosing for an hour is great-you meet some great people, it's a game where you have to communicate a lot-it's free and the cosmetics are generally quite cool and reasonably priced (with some of the money going directly to the creators)-in game spectating-lots of variety in the mechanics, the game is like an enormously complex ball of yarn-MOBA's are an interesting emergent genre-when you get swole the game does a good job making you feel powerful-amazing art and sound design. Also really well written lore-can actually be fairly depressing. When you have been playing alongside 4 other guys for 60+ minutes and then mistake mean's that all that effort was wasted and your ""teammates"" then turn on you, well that's a pretty cruddy feeling. I also see a lot of jerks attacking other players based on some perceived lack of skill, and just a lot of general nastiness.-no way to really play a quick game-you can often loose a game down to something that happens on the other side of the map with nothing to do with you. Having a feeder on your team is frustrating.-I've kinda got to get jacked up to play properly, it demands your full attention while you're playingAs stated above I have had some of my best experiences in gaming playing dota 2. It's a game that leaves my hands shaking post game but it requires an investment of time and a bit of a thick skin. Still, brilliant game, excellently realized, definitely worth your timeReveiw #100 Woohoo Go Dan"

97,"1,241.1",Recommended," March 18, 2015",3,"Dota 2 is a 2013 multiplayer online battle arena video game and the stand-alone sequel to the Defense of the Ancients (DotA) Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos and Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne mod. Developed by Valve Corporation, Dota 2 was released as a free-to-play title for Microsoft Windows, OS X and Linux in July 2013, concluding a Windows-only public beta testing phase that began in 2011. The game is available exclusively through Valve's content-delivery platform, Steam.Dota 2 is played in discrete matches involving two teams of five players, each of which occupies a stronghold at a corner of the map. Each stronghold contains a building called the ""Ancient"", which the opposite team must destroy to win the match. Each player controls a ""Hero"" character and focuses on leveling up, collecting gold, acquiring items and fighting against the other team to achieve victory.Development of Dota 2 began in 2009, when the developer of the DotA mod, IceFrog, was hired by Valve as lead designer. Dota 2 was praised by critics for its gameplay, production quality and faithfulness to its predecessor. However, the game was criticized for its steep learning curve and inhospitable community. Dota 2 has become the most actively played game on Steam, with daily peaks of over 800,000 concurrent players."

137,"2,140.8",Recommended," December 16, 2013",3,"If riding around on a big hairy creature, bashing people with a hammer is your thing, Dota 2 has you covered. Sort of. Dota 2 offers a huge array of characters that enable players to take roles that are in their wheelhouse. Whether you like sneaking and ganking, smashing through the frontlines, or sitting back and supporting your team from a distance, there are characters that do all that and more. What immediately strikes me about Dota, to coin a hideously overused cliché, is that it's easy to learn, but difficult to master. While the game is generally forgiving, the players are much less so. As with all multiplayer games, the experience of playing with others can be a bit of a mixed bag. The most important thing to remember about Dota 2 is this: it's not about winning, it's about losing stylishly to progressively more back-breaking, marrow-sucking odds."
96,"4,487.9",Recommended," July 5, 2015",3,"This game is very, well it's great actually. It's a blast to play if you have friends and what not and it requires the balence of stratigic play and alot of patience. The patience part comes in for the other players you happen to play with honestly. If you have a full team of friends then you are practically set but if not you will never know what to expect from this game. There are the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who think they are good just because they can carry with a really nooby-no skilled hero and can get all the kills in thee world and say that you are the noob or god knows what because of your KDA ratio.There are the trolls, they do whatever it is possible to make the experience a living hell and do whatever it takes too feed the other team and get them all farmed up leaving your team to fend for the low bit of stuff they have.There are the other countries who only know the words ♥♥♥♥♥♥, noob, ♥♥♥♥ (and its variants) and any of the hero names.And of course the new players, I personally have nothing against them other than the fact 9/10 they will not take advice they will just roam and feed and buy stuff that does not work with the hero they are playing.So if you have lots of patience and a group of friends too work with go have fun!

13,388.2,Not Recommended," December 21, 2016",3,"I have decided to write this review to help keep my thoughts of the game, and how I can never, EVER, go back to it, even though you'll see hundreds of reviews say ""lol it has ruined me but I can't stop playing it xD"", I am here to argue that the updates have alienated players over time because of additions that nobody has asked for. Also so I don't recite to myself why I never play dota anymore.It's hard to mention that my love for the game started all the way back in 2014, and I tried to spend a few hours on the game per week. It was never a game that, unlike the dictation of valve, stole my money for cosmetics, rather, I just spent loose pennies on the market. But DotA was definitely a game where I enjoyed just to hop online solo and tried to make the most out of it. Granted, the tutorials were crap, in fact, they still are, but I tried my best to have fun quick, And fun I did indeed have.it is worthy to note I made a couple of friends and we use to sit in chats, discussing ideas and builds for our favorite hero, taking the joke now and then, ""You're just a filthy Slark main,"" And I genuinly believed that the game was only getting better, adding new heroes and changing others for balance.Then the map started changing, and I didn't mind because it opened up new paths. They had not even bothered to change the path detection on the ""practise last hit"" maps, which shows that they really don't steer to a newer fanbase. Then the new runes were added, which made the Bottle a core part of nearly every mid hero. This also made it so impossible to poke a hero down because they would regen back, because don't worry, whilst you got invisibility, they got a bounty rune. And I didn't mind because now there wasn't a RNG 50/50 chance. But the map wasn't why I left DotA.I would go on to mention about ""how horrible and toxic the community"" is, or ""how my language has gotten so much better because of those Russians,"" but I really didn't have any problems with this. If there's a language barrier, you've got to compromise that not everybody can meet your expectation. I have never encountered a problem with this because you don't just say in all chat ""We got a Russian, GG"" or ""♥♥♥♥ off back to EUE you Communist,"" and if you do, you're just another problem if you want to address the community. But this isn't why DotA put me off playing it.Then all of a sudden, some very exciting news, a new update that nobody asked for, DotA: Reborn. I expressed to my friends how this update was a ""horrible idea and how unnecessary it is"" but it's not like Valve would care if I wrote an E-mail saying ""I don't like it."" Naturally, I decided to download the Beta, and see what if it's like. Reminder: at face value: Bad.I loaded the DotA: Reborn. I hate it instantly. I can always see my FPS. What I saw made me give a pitiful laugh: 20FPS. I've played the game for near 400 hours and I've never encountered this problem naturally. I try to browse the menu, terrible experience. The tutorials we're now just long winded bot matches and constantly throwing text - like anybody who plays a tutorial wants to sit there and read for half a minute, JUST to understand:""You can earn xp being near the creep, and you can deny the enemy of gold by pressing A + left click on your mouse on the enemy creep which is mostly likely by your friendly creep."" (No, this is not offical text, just what it felt like.)I didn't just check the tutorial and slapped a couple of bots around, I went onto a public game. At this point, I couldn't stare at what had been a beautiful game. In order to play, I had to put things onto the lowest graphical setting. And this is the problem with DotA. I thought the art style was beautiful, but in order for that, I had to go out of my way to spend who knows how much for gaming equipment. Why would I, a person who plays casually, want to go all out as if I want to play competitive?...Oooh right... Incase you are not aware, one of the reasons why DotA 2 is popular is because of it's position in the E-sports scene, raising, literally, over a million in 1st place. How do they do this? By people buying these compendiums and other event-exclusive rewards. My theory, is that Valve is trying to entice a game, where people, who have plently of slurplus money, can enjoy and reap the rewards of the lastest arcana. Valve, unintentionally or not, have alienated people like me because they are pushing a game where all they want is money, event or not. They've updated the game to a point, where older generations, like me, is damn near impossible to find what the game once was. Perhaps it is nostalgia. Perhaps it's searching for a lost feeling. Perhaps I should demand a raise. But the game is slow and irresponsive to what it once was.I told my friends, I said ""if the game is unstable as this, I might go offline for a bit, or go elsewhere."" I don't think I've recieved a backlash from them, or perhaps there not on my list anymore. but I just held out hope for stability as I continued with the DotA is use to know.In addition, there was a time where I would be happy to exclaim to my friends ""Yeah! Download it! Sure, the file is big, but it's full of epic content that we can play; together!"" Now I never want to bring it up again.Reborn has rolled out as an offical update to Dota, and I only remember sitting in the dark as I hopelessly couldn't play the game. Perhaps it was the graphics. Perhaps it was the lag. Perhaps it was my frames. All I remember was sadness, as the game drifted away, and I unistalled it from my files. I didn't keep up with DotA updates or the pro scene. I never once mentioned it again.Months later, I got a message on steam, along the lines of ""Hey <whatever my name was then>, remember when we use to play DotA, I know you don't like it nowadays, but can we just play for old times sake?""""Fine, but I'll have to download it.""""yeah, big file, but I'm sure you'll remember the good times!""""Yes,"" so let's assume I spent 2 hours waiting, got into a party and we headed into all pick. I played a match. Instantly, I'm hit with a wave of unbalance to expect something out of CS:GO. i'm a support with no farm, and my friend, who was the carry, decided to wonder over to all the others lanes. Except mine. Lina, who has all the expensive cosmetics, easily presses R on me as I'm hopelessly behind. I say to him in steam chat ""You really need to come top to help me.""No response.As I'm hopeless to doing anything, because of the rate of the game on the lowest setting, I admit defeat, leave the game, uninstall it, again. I don't think I typed another word to them. But if it were, it'd be along the lines of ""THIS IS THE WORST GAME I'VE PLAYED THIS YEAR.""So, all of a sudden, my steam won't stop bothering me with patch 7.00, which was to ""change DotA as a whole... spooks everyone because of how sudden it is."" Well, if it changed the game, maybe just one more try...Don't get me started at how they expect others to play custom games for hours on end, yet they messed that up and didn't provide an easy port to it. Don't get me explaining how the community is in uproar at how useless the new hud is. Don't get excited that ""Monkey King"", is a new, exciting hero, yet nearly every MOBA has one. DotA, is a game, where you can only enjoy with your expensive, rich, pc with your higher-class friends, sipping wine as you throw racial slurs into the All-Chat.DotA, from my perspective, is a bad game.Congratulations on reading my story and history with DotA, I promise to anyone I USE to enjoy the game. That, was a long time ago. I now spend my time on LoL, atleast that game can run over 60 FPS without a problem."

284,"3,549.1",Recommended," August 1, 2014",3,"If Carlsberg Did Mobas --- Best Game EVEROk first off a sortof mixed review. I love and hate this game.I first started playing dota just after the international 2013. I moved into a house where the housemates were hell bent on this game and had friends over every day to play it.It was the 1st MOBA i had ever played, infact i had never even heard of the term MOBA before, (and for those who dont know it stands for Multiplayer Online Battle Arena)First of all i was LUCKY i had friends who played this, and watched and got help from them as they played before even starting the game, as when landed into the thick of it, it is quite daunting. The tutorials are BLAH... until you actually get to the main gameplay tutorials, but no mention of custom build selection??? , this is another reason why some of my friends have just given up. From my experience, if you are a keen gamer STICK WITH IT. However if you value your life then give up now because it is very addictive, stressful and fun in the same sentence.DOTA is a very tactical game, which is extremely fun, overwhelmingly addictive too and by knowing the basic fundamentals and working as a team and not being arrogant or being able to take advice you can have a great game. You dont have to be an absolute strategist to win, although it does helpThe problem with this game is the community, and that is not the communitys problem, infact i blame the creators VALVE for not putting enough restrictions in place, and the restrictions they do put in place are ridiculous.First of all you have to have a half decent machine to play this on standard settings ( i sometimes even have problems on lowest settings on this machine and my machine lives up to their MINIUMUM SPECS. That saying that the game is quite playable for the most time on their minimum specs, but it seems bugs do keep popping up that they just wont sort outAlso take the game as it is... free to play... and if anything happens just suck your gut in and relax.VALVE support absolutely sucks, so if anything goes wrong and you have any problems dont go running to valve for help because i have done this on more than 3 occasions, with a 2 day + response of just ""sorry we cannot help you with this issue"". And my last email getting the response ""We will ignore any future emails about this issue from you""Back to the community... Dont take ranked too personally. DOTA is a TEAM game, however many times you will get landed with players who cannot play as a team, don't get the essence of DOTA in the same way you do, are absolutely rude and ignorant and arrogant. My advice after lots of headaches.... sod them, you are playing because you like to play, if you suck they dont help by screaming at you, and if you are dieing too often (and not intentionally feeding) then it is their fault for not working as a team and protecting you.Also matchmaking, you will find when you get into the game servers.... english speakers take off everything except us east, west and europe west and set language preference as english. This wont stop you being annoyingly teamed with people who dont speak english, but it sure helps... for some reason people dont understand communication is fundamental for a team game and selfishly pick servers where the know they will be teamed up with people who dont speak their languages. YES I AM SPEAKING TO ALL YOU RUSSIANS WHO SELECT EVERYTHING OTHER THAN RUSSIA.Other problems are that with the report system or restrictions. Now people with low end computer who get annoying bugs ingame which randomly kick them off suffer most. However it goes for everyone on the report system. I rarely use it anymore because it does jack♥♥♥♥♥♥unless you are with a group of people you know will report the same person for the same actions. You get 3 a week no matter how much you play, which is dreadful, and you only get a report back if action is taken against someone, which seems to me it doesnt matter what they have done, if noone else reports it there is no check and they get away scott free. Unfortunately if you are in a game and the rest of your team is a party, and they dont like you for some reason... excpect a 6 game ban in low priority.Also a new bug bear that has come out is this ""Failed to load"" Scenario.. My games usualy load up, with some slow lagging problems at the start but manage to settle itself out. When the games didnt load it was a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥and you may have to search another 3 - 10 mins for a game, but that was an annoyance i could live with. Now on the odd occasion i fail to load i get penalised for half an hour from finding ANY game, except ones with bots, remember failing to load does not effect the game as the game hasnt currently started, and it is annoying but getting a ban from finding a match for 30 mins (i even got an hour at one instance) is ridiculous, taking in account that a game lasts between 30 and 60 mins on average. that means sometimes when you only have a set ammount of time to play you are screwed.[Bugs ive experienced taken out since they dont appear anymore on new laptop upgrade]Other than that this game is the most fun game i've ever played, and so rewarding so no matter how crap valve are, or no matter how annoying the game can be at times, i alway come back for more. Even if it means playing out my low priority ban matches with complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥s"

Small graphics of players' items, worst thing now. I can't understand the player's items now, so small figures. The map is changed a lot, became worse than ever. Bounty was okey but why giving 4 bounties, why are you boosting the gold and exp of people. Why did you even changed Roshan's place, what is it in your mind? Adding new items is okey, deleting or changing an item might be okey too(if you don't change a lot). You lost so many players. I can only find a match when I wait for 4-5 minutes. It will increase because players like me are going to delete dota2 and play other games.. This game was so much better."

104,"2,055.6",Recommended," October 6, 2014",3,"Honestly the most intense, competetive game I've played since back in the days of CoD:WaW! Bad example, but especially for being free and the huge following...I've drowned more time that I'd like to admit on this game. So addictive and fun when you actually get past the learning curve and start to get good. Always something to learn, and mostly every patch adds something cool or refreshing to the game i.e a new hero or changes to the map or something of the sort!Download, and enjoy kicking♥♥♥♥♥with your friends!"
75,"2,613.0",Recommended," August 22, 2014",3,"I love the game! It really gets addicting, which explains my playtime, lol. You might not like it at first, but I bet it will really turn into your close-to-everyday hobby after a while, once you have gotten the hang of it. It has a huge variety of heroes to choose from, enjoy, experiment, and master. Though there are still a few missing heroes from the original Defense of the Ancients, like Arc Warden, Winter Wyvern, and Abyssal Underlord, the constant updates on the game which balances heroes, and adds more content will still make you have fun and be strategic on the game.Hero sets, and other custom items like HUDs, Loading Screens, etc. are present in the game. Hero sets are a handful of items which customizes the whole hero. From head to toe. And I guess I don't have to explain the custom HUDs and stuff, right?There are a few yearly events to look upon on as well. Like New Bloom (Chinese New Year), Diretide (Halloween), Frostivus (Christmas), some random events like the recent Foreseer's Contract event which gives you and possibly quite a few more that I have missed since I have not played the game for long. Each of the first three events offers a new map as well as new content, as I have mentioned earlier. Map changes may also vary on future game updates.But like all other games, there are flaws, the #1 flaw would be the really bad community. Only rarely you see friendly, good players who will actually help newbies learn. Most people in the game are rather stupid in the sense that they insult people who are new to the game, blames others for their own mistakes, and those who trashtalks for no reason. There are players which does not know how to wait for someone too, causing them to receive an abandon and gets them into the low prioprity punishment pool. Gets really really annoying. No justice done, really.There are some people who ruins games too, which can be explained in one word - ""troll"". They feed the enemy team intentionally. Worst part is that, reporting them never does anything. The reports need better management. No, Valve, the low priority pool isn't that good of a punishment either. Some players just report other users with no apparent reason, and I think causing them an LP would not do any justice. At least examine the reports before taking action?Another thing is the servers. Some users has gotten problems where the server would just kick them out for no reason which yet again causes them an abandon. There are instances where the servers would actually crash due to an update during a really good game. Really. Happened to me once, was not happy. Especially when the game is already over an hour long and you were winning a hardly fought match. Seriously.This is just based on my own experiences and my opinion, you might disagree on some stuff I have uttered, but overall I like this game. It gets even better when you get to know the right people, and I think I'll give it an 8/10. I have met a lot of really good friends from this game, I hope you try it out and find your own. Have fun!"
96,"4,487.9",Recommended," July 5, 2015",3,"This game is very, well it's great actually. It's a blast to play if you have friends and what not and it requires the balence of stratigic play and alot of patience. The patience part comes in for the other players you happen to play with honestly. If you have a full team of friends then you are practically set but if not you will never know what to expect from this game. There are the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who think they are good just because they can carry with a really nooby-no skilled hero and can get all the kills in thee world and say that you are the noob or god knows what because of your KDA ratio.There are the trolls, they do whatever it is possible to make the experience a living hell and do whatever it takes too feed the other team and get them all farmed up leaving your team to fend for the low bit of stuff they have.There are the other countries who only know the words ♥♥♥♥♥♥, noob, ♥♥♥♥ (and its variants) and any of the hero names.And of course the new players, I personally have nothing against them other than the fact 9/10 they will not take advice they will just roam and feed and buy stuff that does not work with the hero they are playing.So if you have lots of patience and a group of friends too work with go have fun! If not, have fun and Welcome to the world of Dota"
252,"2,132.1",Recommended," February 22, 2015",3,"This game is a lot of fun. If you're new to this game I suggest starting off with passive bots, then easy, then medium, and after you can win a couple hard bot games then I feel you can try out public matches against other human players. Bots and human players play completely differently however. The reason to play bots at first is just to get comfortable with basic builds and to get confident with your hero's ability set. Jumping into public games without any previous MOBA experience will likely result in angry team mates and losing games. I would say this game requires a lot of practice before you really begin to understand any of the heroes. This is why using the random function is quite useful in the humans vs bots modes until you are comfortable with many of the heroes. The biggest downside I can think of to this game is even if you select ""English"" as your preferred language and choose US East and US West servers, you'll still encounter many team mates that can speak no English whatsoever. When you're ready for public matches, I suggest starting off with the Limited Heroes game mode so you don't get overwhelmed by all the heroes."

No one flames you for mistakes, in fact other players help you become better.A mix of different cultures stand united with one goal i.e. destroying the enemy ancient.You can make new friends from various countries no matter which server you play. This allows players to learn new languages which adds up to real life skill.Playing this game improves your decision-making and critical-thinking. Once again this adds up to your real life skill.Cons:Game can be a bit overwhelming for new players since all heroes (100+) are available for free. I think it would be better if only 25 heroes were available each week and players could unlock the roster with micro-transactions."

0,"1,191.0",Recommended," December 6, 2014",3,"This game requires logical thinking. It's fun when you have a team that knows what they're doing. Prefer this over League of Legends.DotA 2 = Chess.LoL= Checkers.That pretty much sums it up.Pros--Fun.-Well balanced.-Every hero is and has a counter-hero.-Meet different people.-More strategic depth.-You don't have to buy your Heroes or characters, this disables in-game advantage to people who use real money.-Wider Hero diversity. No gap closer, slow, utility spell on everyone unlike LoL. Every Hero is unique.Cons--Tutorial isn't done yet. Pretty hard for people who are new to MOBA.-The learning curve is very, very, very steep.-LoL also has outside factors affecting the game, such as runes you can unlock and equip outside of the game, to affect every match in some way. DotA doesn't have any idiocy like that. Your win or loss is completely unaffected outside of the current match you are in.This is coming from someone who hasn't played a lot of videogames. I have compared it with LoL and that is my opinion. This is affected my academics significantly. My family doesn't like me anymore because I'm addicted to this game a lot, to be honest. Also, this game needs some changes on its MMR system, because of which I had to create this account to start DotA all over again to improve my stats. I hope something would be done about it in the future, and new servers would be opened up in countries where people get terrible ping such as India.I would definitely recommend this to people who are capable of logical thinking. Decisions need to be made much faster and people who would love such games and not easy ones such as LoL should definitely give this game a try.This ruined my life. My social life is pathetic, my parents don't like me, and I'm terrible at academics as I mentioned earlier. At home, people made sure I don't play DotA 2. So, I secretly game at a gaming parlor almost everyday. I spent half or all of my college fund on DotA 2 and other games on Steam. My parents are unaware of this. Addicted so much, and I'm just in high school. Good game life.Reason - DotA 2.5 out of 5. Definitely would recommend."

3,"1,244.3",Recommended," October 31, 2017",3,"Close the game, delete steam, burn your computer, welcome to DOTA! Dota (defense of the ancients) is a game with a fairly interesting history, starting life as a 5v5 competitive map mod for warcraft 3 before various team members splitting off to try and re-create the magic in stand alone games. Gameplay visually has the look of an RTS albeit with you only having one unit but mechanically it is vastly different and you will have people yelling at you if you try and play dota 2 like an RTS. There is an extensive hero roster ensuring games stay dynamic and the game receives constant balance tweaks. The multiplayer match making functions well and the recent addition of an in game mod manager for alternative game modes and maps in yet another welcome addition. For me, Dota 2 represents the most crushed I've ever felt after playing a game and also the most elated I've felt. It's just that broad of a range and when it's good it's so so good.Good-super fun. The feeling of turning around a game that you have slowly been loosing for an hour is great-you meet some great people, it's a game where you have to communicate a lot-it's free and the cosmetics are generally quite cool and reasonably priced (with some of the money going directly to the creators)-in game spectating-lots of variety in the mechanics, the game is like an enormously complex ball of yarn-MOBA's are an interesting emergent genre-when you get swole the game does a good job making you feel powerful-amazing art and sound design. Also really well written lore-can actually be fairly depressing. When you have been playing alongside 4 other guys for 60+ minutes and then mistake mean's that all that effort was wasted and your ""teammates"" then turn on you, well that's a pretty cruddy feeling. I also see a lot of jerks attacking other players based on some perceived lack of skill, and just a lot of general nastiness.-no way to really play a quick game-you can often loose a game down to something that happens on the other side of the map with nothing to do with you. Having a feeder on your team is frustrating.-I've kinda got to get jacked up to play properly, it demands your full attention while you're playingAs stated above I have had some of my best experiences in gaming playing dota 2. It's a game that leaves my hands shaking post game but it requires an investment of time and a bit of a thick skin. Still, brilliant game, excellently realized, definitely worth your timeReveiw #100 Woohoo Go Dan"

Dota 2 is a exceptional game with a variety of characters, and a wide range of items to choose from. BUT, with the last few updates my game has done nothing but freeze and continue to kick me out of games telling me that i have lost connection to steam. I dont know why it's doing this and I dont know how to fix it but i thought you should know that with every game there are bugs. Dota 2 is no exception. I have put far too many hours into the game to give up now because I know these bugs will be fixed sooner or later. The point I'm trying to make is that no matter the bug, no matter the update I fell for a strategy game that none of my friends had played but now we all play. It is the best Steam game to get and make new friends and have a great time, and for that I will continue to play.PS- If anyone takes the time to read this Like or Dislike just so I know I didnt waste time Lol"

The patience part comes in for the other players you happen to play with honestly. If you have a full team of friends then you are practically set but if not you will never know what to expect from this game. There are the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who think they are good just because they can carry with a really nooby-no skilled hero and can get all the kills in thee world and say that you are the noob or god knows what because of your KDA ratio.There are the trolls, they do whatever it is possible to make the experience a living hell and do whatever it takes too feed the other team and get them all farmed up leaving your team to fend for the low bit of stuff they have.There are the other countries who only know the words ♥♥♥♥♥♥, noob, ♥♥♥♥ (and its variants) and any of the hero names.And of course the new players, I personally have nothing against them other than the fact 9/10 they will not take advice they will just roam and feed and buy stuff that does not work with the hero they are playing.So if you have lots of patience and a group of friends too work with go have fun!

DOTA, its predecessor, was an amazing map that I used to play with friends, DOTA 2 is just a target jokes nowadays. Boasting a lovely all Russian Matchmaking, with off-branches such as Turkey Matchmaking and Brazilian (HueHueHue) Matchmaking. If you wish to play DOTA 2, all I can say is go ahead. It's an amazing game that deserves so much more, a one man's story. It's you, and them, your team's just a meat shield.

This game will literally kick you when you're down,♥♥♥♥♥♥on you, and then continue to make you give your own father fellatio. Dota is not a game for the faint at heart and one should only attempt to play it if ready to lose; but losing the match isn't all you'll lose! When playing with friends you will find yourself constantly hating each other as you or your friend(s) ♥♥♥♥ up. You will latch onto that hate and it will consume you. If you can survive the hate and keep coming back though, you will soon emerge into a world of new found misery and sometimes joy, as you begin to learn the basics. You will start to win, while you remain to lose at the same time. Dota 2 is a game where the player never truly wins. The player is never truly good, they're only slightly better each and every time; and every time will be different, no matter how many hours you pour into the masochistic game, that is -- Dota 2."

If you have a full team of friends then you are practically set but if not you will never know what to expect from this game. There are the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who think they are good just because they can carry with a really nooby-no skilled hero and can get all the kills in thee world and say that you are the noob or god knows what because of your KDA ratio.There are the trolls, they do whatever it is possible to make the experience a living hell and do whatever it takes too feed the other team and get them all farmed up leaving your team to fend for the low bit of stuff they have.There are the other countries who only know the words ♥♥♥♥♥♥, noob, ♥♥♥♥ (and its variants) and any of the hero names.And of course the new players, I personally have nothing against them other than the fact 9/10 they will not take advice they will just roam and feed and buy stuff that does not work with the hero they are playing.So if you have lots of patience and a group of friends too work with go have fun!

75,"2,613.0",Recommended," August 22, 2014",3,"I love the game! It really gets addicting, which explains my playtime, lol. You might not like it at first, but I bet it will really turn into your close-to-everyday hobby after a while, once you have gotten the hang of it. It has a huge variety of heroes to choose from, enjoy, experiment, and master. Though there are still a few missing heroes from the original Defense of the Ancients, like Arc Warden, Winter Wyvern, and Abyssal Underlord, the constant updates on the game which balances heroes, and adds more content will still make you have fun and be strategic on the game.Hero sets, and other custom items like HUDs, Loading Screens, etc. are present in the game. Hero sets are a handful of items which customizes the whole hero. From head to toe. And I guess I don't have to explain the custom HUDs and stuff, right?There are a few yearly events to look upon on as well. Like New Bloom (Chinese New Year), Diretide (Halloween), Frostivus (Christmas), some random events like the recent Foreseer's Contract event which gives you and possibly quite a few more that I have missed since I have not played the game for long. Each of the first three events offers a new map as well as new content, as I have mentioned earlier. Map changes may also vary on future game updates.But like all other games, there are flaws, the #1 flaw would be the really bad community. Only rarely you see friendly, good players who will actually help newbies learn. Most people in the game are rather stupid in the sense that they insult people who are new to the game, blames others for their own mistakes, and those who trashtalks for no reason. There are players which does not know how to wait for someone too, causing them to receive an abandon and gets them into the low prioprity punishment pool. Gets really really annoying. No justice done, really.There are some people who ruins games too, which can be explained in one word - ""troll"". They feed the enemy team intentionally. Worst part is that, reporting them never does anything. The reports need better management. No, Valve, the low priority pool isn't that good of a punishment either. Some players just report other users with no apparent reason, and I think causing them an LP would not do any justice. At least examine the reports before taking action?Another thing is the servers. Some users has gotten problems where the server would just kick them out for no reason which yet again causes them an abandon. There are instances where the servers would actually crash due to an update during a really good game. Really. Happened to me once, was not happy. Especially when the game is already over an hour long and you were winning a hardly fought match. Seriously.This is just based on my own experiences and my opinion, you might disagree on some stuff I have uttered, but overall I like this game. It gets even better when you get to know the right people, and I think I'll give it an 8/10. I have met a lot of really good friends from this game, I hope you try it out and find your own.

After playing quite a bit of LoL and not getting hooked to it I didn't expect too much in Dota 2 but after much playing I can safely say that I played anything for this long and not get bored of it. Simply put, Dota is an exhilarating experience and Valve couldn't put any more of an amazing effort into a game like this. The only troubles you'll probably find are what heroes, abilities and items are ""broken"" in whatever patch you play but don't fear this won't always be the case as Valve seems to balance (and unbalance) the game in every patch. The only other problem is seemingly arrogant (and annoying) players mostly of the Russian and Spanish language but that is not a fault on Valve just the community and that doesn't change me giving this game a 9.5/10"

It is true that you will meet a lot of toxic people in this game, the thing is you can choose not to be one, and if everyone keep himself of being one we can have a toxic-free community.It's a game that needs lots of patience if you want to keep winning. Patience and teamwork is the key. Stop the blame game and the chat fights that cause most of the losses and try to enjoy every single match you get to play with or without friends.Be the teammate you want to have in your team in every single match. If you can't, just stay away from it cause you ruin it it for the others.Make Dota 2 great again."
203,"2,526.1",Recommended," July 24, 2013",3,So is dota 2 a good game well in most aspects its great the look and the feel of the game is one of the best that i have experienced though my years of gaming. Now if you are coming from LoL or another MOBA then you will be in for a rough ride many skills thansfer from on game to another i would say that the only skill that transfers to dota 2 is your reflex as dota is a very hard game if you already play a MOBA of some sort as you will expect many things that don't happen so i suggest going in to dota blind so don't expect anything from other MOBA's as it won't really help you a whole lot. One of the many thing i love about dota is the fact that all hero's are free unlike SMITE and LOL which is really nice. Now to end this review because i suck at english.

26,"1,931.1",Not Recommended," March 20, 2015",3,"Defense Of The Ancients, or DOTA for short is an MMO RTS RPG game with about 100+ characters to choose from i n each match, which average out to be 30 - 45 minutes each. This is not your average FPS, Racing, or Open World game that takes about an hour to get into. Alot of time and concentration must be invested into this vast experience that can define the lives of many individuals. The training system in this game or tutorial if u must only teaches the absolute basics: such as how to move around or how to attack and use your various abilities. This proves only to be the tip of the iceberg as alot more depth and detail is in store for a new playeror a ""scrub/newb"" (as many DOTA community players would call them)Anyways this wasnt much of a review as it was a warning. Dont get into this game and go play online if u havent the faintest idea of how the game is played. Please consult many reviews and play practice matches with AI before going into an actual game with other players, becoz DOTA is a team game, and if one link of the chain falls loose, the whole thing collapses into ruin, not to mention that you'll also♥♥♥♥♥♥the hell out of alot of people by doing this XD."

As for now, all my experience is filled to the edge by absolutely disgusting community. Most players i end up playing with dont ever care about teamwork, about 1/4 just don't even know, what they are doing, what their heros are supposed to do, which ends up in an absolutely screwed-up match, bringing lots of anger and despair when you realize, that you cant simply win by yourself and your team for various reasons cant or doesnt want to assist you. Numerous times i swore i wanna quit this rage-generator and even more times i found hope that i could simply ""git gud"". It wouldn't happen. I cant win 1v5 in my skill bracket and i cant endure this mess to pass higher, so it only brings needless frustration again and again. Before matchmaking gets more organized, better oriented to play proper matches, before players are gonna become more determined to get better, i dont think i'm gonna be able to have more positive than negative thoughts about the game.

33,"7,444.7",Recommended," April 15, 2017",3,"Original Review:Dota2's gaming experience is deteriorting because of the excessive amount of rage feed/throws, wish something can be done about the report and MMR system.Feb 2018Valve finally made its move against griefers, havent seen an intentional feeder in 2 weeks. To be honest this is making me feel a bit uneasy. I am rather used to having feeders on my team every now and then. Was that so hard to do? 6months ban deterence should have come a lot sooner. Took 7 TIs for these guys to realize this game doesnt actually need 12 pucking couriers at the same time, or 5 lp games is just not enough to keep cancerous players at bay. Not long ago you can still get duos in solo queues who most of the times give 0 puck about the result of the game.Conclusion: UX feedback = approximately 0.You can still abuse the ping (poor networking condition) detection system by disconnecting players from both sides to annull the game.Finally, a piece of advice, if you want to gain MMR, you should1. play with people above your rank.2. watch replays or high rank games.3. learn to work with people you despise.4. learn to play good support. This role isnt that hard to play.5. stay calm and rational, when you play with players like Aui Monkeys MP etc, you just feel confident winning no matter how far behind.Dont forget why you play this game"

Feeders, Flamers and other kinds of anti-mates in your team, and the complete other team teaming up on a single player, telling you ""teamplay"" and ""fair-play"". The game is fun with friends, sometimes even alone but the youll notice the non-existent balance in this game. There will always be people laying the most over powered characters in the game (for example Phantom Assassin, Ursa and Riki) and guys insulting you for no reason.Aside from the community a very fun game, still kinda hard in the beginning, you have to learn to play some heroes and the effects of some items, but once youre in it, its a very fun game"
33,"7,444.7",Recommended," April 15, 2017",3,"Original Review:Dota2's gaming experience is deteriorting because of the excessive amount of rage feed/throws, wish something can be done about the report and MMR system.Feb 2018Valve finally made its move against griefers, havent seen an intentional feeder in 2 weeks. To be honest this is making me feel a bit uneasy. I am rather used to having feeders on my team every now and then. Was that so hard to do? 6months ban deterence should have come a lot sooner. Took 7 TIs for these guys to realize this game doesnt actually need 12 pucking couriers at the same time, or 5 lp games is just not enough to keep cancerous players at bay. Not long ago you can still get duos in solo queues who most of the times give 0 puck about the result of the game.Conclusion: UX feedback = approximately 0.You can still abuse the ping (poor networking condition) detection system by disconnecting players from both sides to annull the game.Finally, a piece of advice, if you want to gain MMR, you should1. play with people above your rank.2. watch replays or high rank games.3. learn to work with people you despise.4. learn to play good support. This role isnt that hard to play.5. stay calm and rational, when you play with players like Aui Monkeys MP etc, you just feel confident winning no matter how far behind.Dont forget why you play this game"

I stopped making silly mistakes and I got vastly better at not feeding the enemy team. For the most part, everyone I've met was very helpful and nice, there have sometimes the jerk however. As I continue to play DOTA2 more and more, I'm sure I'll continue to improve. I recommend this game for all. :)"
189,802.1,Recommended," August 14, 2014",3,"I remember when I begun my very first journey in playing this game. It was around the early part of my first trimester during my Junior year in high school. A very close friend of mine who I regard as a younger brother presented to me the idea of playing DotA 2. In order to strengthen our bonds and to give myself something else to do in my spare time I willingly decided that it would be a good idea to play. My first game went like this: if Hell could be virtually contained, then DotA 2 surely is the closest thing one can get to gates of Hell. Fortunately, there is hope for those who enter: not continuing to play. My first game was played as Nyx Assassin, a hero that I picked PURELY out of his latter namesake in my juvenile adoration and understanding of the stealthy playstyle in the days of my adolescent youth. What had begun as an attempt to become closer to my friend became a gnashing, foaming, teeth-grinding session of psychological torment that flayed away my ideas of what is good and what is bad in this world.My descent into this game only proved my avarice for failure as the level of suck I displayed went well beyond the expectations of a five year old attempting to play any video game with alluring colors and noises. Creeps mocked me, the courier was an ally I seldom knew, gold was a luxury to obtain, the jungle was a nightmarish land of prison strongmen that held me down when their amusement at my attempt to challenge their authority would finally cease, and those that played amongst regarded me as an abomination of wicked biology that combined nearly every terrible epidemic of human history finally fused with a bubbling carcenogentic tumor that only lived to spread its filth across the playerbase, further soiling what little health was there to maintain. Depression quickly ensued...and I fell to the depths of despair. ""Forever bad,"" I would declare to myself...""Forever bad.""Years later...I have become what most dread. A vindictive young man whose only desire in solo public matchmaking is to preserve and defend the dregs of my cancer by picking supports and buying wards and couriers only to see a swift decrease in awareness and reckless use of the courier, who meets its end by the hand of a five-death squad that originally intended to end the life of the useless carry that fell victim to the folly of buying boots first and declared my incompetency for not providing him with shared tangos.DotA 2 is a curse, my friend. Do not fall victim as many others have. Please...reconsider...I beseech thee...re...consider..."

245,"2,165.2",Recommended," November 24, 2016",3,"(This review is for SEA Servers in general, and it doesn't follow a format)My Opinion:This game has been a big part of my life, and it really satisfied my competitive nature but as time goes on, it just doesn't feel quite like it used to. I used to get really into this game, getting relatively good and playing almost daily just because I want to. Now it feels like a chore to play, what with all the selfish and toxic players who thinks their ""better"" at the game, and those who just don't understand the mechanics of the game. I get it, it's not easy understanding which items to get and what skills to take first. I mean I still haven't fully grasped the itemization aspect of this game, but I do understand the core mechanics of this game. And the communication in this game is close to zero, the closest you get to communication is ""Ward Pls"" or ""Y no ward!!??!?"" or ""Fail Mid"", even in the so called 'ranked' mode where you're supposedly teamed up with players of your skill. I guess it's just me but I see players like these in paid games too so I don't know.All that being said though, the game's core is actually great if you're into real competitive MOBA. It requires both skill and item management as well as game sense. If you get left behind on exp and gold you will get snowballed, so you have to know when and where to farm those. The skills for heroes are mostly single target except for some that you have to aimyourself (and pray it hits the enemy). The thing that makes DOTA different (based on my MOBA experiences) are the items which could turn the tides of the battle in an instant. For instance, if the enemy team has stuns, just buy a Black King Bar and it gives you invulnerability for 10 seconds which is plenty of time. So in addition to hero counters, you can have items that enhance your abilities and team's ability to fight.This game also offers every single content it has (except for cosmetics and things alike), all the heroes, items and modes are free so you can experience the full game right off the bat. Also this is also one of the games with the most expensive cosmetics going up to thousands of dollars which just blows my mind.I guess what makes me slowly move away from this game is the community. I admit I am not the best player and I make tons of mistakes, but the players I'm teamed up with are just whiny blamers that are contributing nothing to the match instead of actually come up with a way to turn the tides. This is the MAIN problem for 90% of the total hours I put on this game and it's still happening now (and most likely forever). So I usually find some friends to play with so at least the flaming is controlled (sometimes it goes out of hand but hey you can't expect everyone to be at your level) and we can think of a way to turn the tides.TL;DRIt's a solid competitive MOBA game. The core mechanic is simple, kill enemies, get towers, get the final tower, win game. But it is difficult to master the heroes and itemization aspect of the game, hero counters and item counters. Give it a try, it's free and who knows, maybe you might be amazing at it. Just keep in mind that if you are serious getting into the game, get a couple of good friends/teammates and play in a party. And for those who just want to play casually, just play vs bots and try out the heroes first, then gradually move to unranked match. Trust me. I've endured 2000+ hours of all kinds of players."

312,"5,727.5",Recommended," November 23, 2017",3,"DotA 2 is quite like life. You're going to make mistakes. You're going to be put on the spot for those mistakes. At times your allies will feel like your enemies. At times you will feel like you have friends in enemies. You'll meet people you don't understand at all. You'll once in a rare time, meet someone who you get along with superbly. You'll have moments where you lose faith in humanity, then you will have those that restore said faith. You're going to suffer through it for long periods of time. You're going to enjoy it for even shorter periods of time. Yet, you push onward with hopes, goals and dreams.Many of us wonder why we still play this game or even put ourselves through it all. As someone once said, ""DotA is a blessing and a curse"". That quote is quite spot on for this game, but it doesn't tell you that it's more of a curse than a blessing. Why do we keep playing you ask? Perhaps it is because we are human. Perhaps it is because we enjoy challenging ourselves. For even if you play DotA 2 for thousands of hours on end, every match you play has a different player in it. Their playstyle is different. Maybe they're more skilled than the last person you saw playing a specific hero. Maybe they're more skilled. Maybe they did something completely unorthodox and reminded you of the fact that no hero is meant to be a specific way. Perhaps it is this variety that keeps us going. In the moments where you have a victory that you have fought long and hard for, or, you manage to meet some splendid folk in your match, whether on your team or the enemy's, you realize very briefly, why you enjoy or will enjoy this game.So, yes, my fellow people. Every bad and good thing you will see or hear about this game is true. It will eat your time, your hope, your relationships even. It can consume you. You will need great strength to succeed and enjoy this game in the form of forgiving, thanking, working hard without recognition, resilience to corruption and so forth. The journey is worth it, if you are able to do this. The lore for this game is fantastic and so is its history. For this reason alone, I can claim that it is one of the best MOBAs you will play.As valve themselves have claimed, ""What does a hero truly need?""That is up to you. You decide what path you will take, not only in your matches, but in every choice you make along your journey. Will you be an Offlaner? Will you be a Support? Will you be a Carry/Core? Will you focus on Utility or Crowd Control? Will you become Corrupt or will you be Strong, not only for yourself but for your allies?There is much more to say about the the world of DotA 2. The rest you can discover on your own. Good luck to all of you. Make the community stronger and better. We all, this work of art included, deserve to be pushed to our full potential and enjoy ourselves."

The bad thing is when you play, if you die once or make one mistake, people start criticizing you as if you're in a real battle and their life depends on it. Here's a good example: There are 3 lanes, with 5 members on each team. Sometimes you are the only one on your team guarding a certain lane. 3 or 4 people on the other team jump out of nowhere and instantly kill you (even when you are playing it safe and right, it just happens). This happens a few times. Your teammates are nowhere to be found. But they are quick to start telling everyone to report you and how bad you suck. So if you decide to back off to where you are letting the other team destroy your towers, because the other team is good at coordinating ninja gang ambushes, then they get mad and say to report you. So now you have a weak character from the other team leveling up and you dying a few times, and realize the other team will destroy me if I go near any of them. So I'll just not do anything and stay away from the action so I don't feed the other team and so I don't have my teammates belittle me. Then guess what happens. Report him (me). Why should I want to play a game where everyone tells me I'm no good and wants to report me? They just talk all of this crap, and 50% of the time they are losing and dying just as bad as you. And your teammates can see all of your items, so if you buy something they don't want you to buy, or don't buy something they tell you to, they go on a never ending nag fest until you do. So they control the coins I earned...right. I'm not 16 anymore, I can't sit down and play this game for 12 hours a day, 8 days a week. So I won't know every single move for the 100+ characters, or have the same knowledge as those people that do all the time. I do not enjoy it one bit. I uninstalled this game before for this reason. Didn't play it for half a year. Now I just played it for 1 night and I'm sick of it again. Try Paragon. It's a cross-platform 3rd person 5v5 MOBA. Much better experience. You can find a match in less than a minute. Highly recommend that game.

Well... read ahead then my dear no-lifer (says the one that spends time writing game reviews in Steam)!So... where should I start? Of course... from the start! A friend of mine invited me to play this ""Super badass game"" with him and after days and weeks of pleads I finally bent to his will. Entered the game, all felt fine. He was a pro player and guided me through it. I am also a sharp person that never does anything if he's unprepared so I read a few tons of guides from DotA legends and watched plenty of tournament videos before my first game. I started high above all the newbies and my lerning curve was quite fluent. This means I rarely got to deal with raging idiots, though rarely is not the same as never. Even I that played at a higher level than my matches got raged at from time to time. Imagine how a normal player felt... brainless, super confident brats keep yelling at everyone they don't like (even if he is playing well) that he is terrible and should uninstall the game. Heck, the best guide ever writen for the game starts with a description on how to mute players and how to shield your psych... So yeah, nail number one in DotAs coffin: Yeah, there are some nice guys that survived but their numbers are rapidly dwindling and honestly... even the kids at LoL are nicer these days!I can keep this up for quite a bit but I realise readers are dropping off from the review like mosquitoes near ""Raid"" with every line I add so lets cut it here and shoot the word: The game is duying and unless it gets a restart it will keep degrading.

218,219.2,Recommended," May 17, 2016",69,"Product received for freeDota 2 is hard, but there's a huge reward for those who commit. On the surface, the game is a like-for-like reproduction of the genre-creating (and still updated) Defense of the Ancients modification for Warcraft III, now transferred into Valve's Source engine. The game's punishing design is sometimes enough to drive you up the wall, but it's worth sticking the hours in: success in Dota 2 is about learning to effectively juggle both the broad strokes and finer details.If you're not aware of the basics of the burgeoning MOBA genre, two teams of five players spawn on corners of a map.Each team needs to work together with the goal of ultimately destroying a central structure--in Dota 2's case, the Ancient--in the opposing team's base. With most games lasting around the 40-minute mark, and occasionally edging past an hour, watching the enemy fortress dramatically crumble and sink to the ground feels like an exhilarating payoff.Aiding these two teams, named the Radiant and the Dire, are waves of AI assistants, called creeps. Batches of creeps spawn at 30-second intervals and charge merrily up the map's three pathways. In the clumps of remaining land lies a jungle, where numerous AI opponents spawn, offering lucrative benefits to players who take them on successfully. Finally, and in a bid to stop both teams from simply marching into one another's base, each team gets three powerful towers on each lane that easily shred through enemy players at the start of the game.Your individual ability to control and affect the rhythm of the game comes from how well you handle your hero. You mostly control a single unit in Dota 2, though there are exceptions: some heroes can summon controllable allies, such as bears, gargoyle babies, or wolves; one exceptionally versatile hero can split into three; and one item lets you take control of certain creeps. For each rule in Dota 2's impressive house-of-cards design, there's usually at least one character who completely ignores it, or finds a way around it via one of 130-odd items available from the in-match shop. For instance, try negating magic attacks with the black king bar, returning damage with the blade mail, or pounding out two ultimate abilities in quick succession with a refresher orb.The aim for most players is to accumulate as much gold and experience as possible, with income being delivered mostly by scoring the killing blow on enemy creeps and players. It's almost always easier to gang up on stray enemies as a group, which is why it's rarely a good idea to run about on your own. Then it's a case of splashing all your hard-earned money on some ultra-powerful items from the shop, while levelling up your base stats and abilities, and then clobbering the enemy team into submission via a few five-versus-five team fights. Rarely does it feel that simple, however.At the time of writing, 102 of the original Dota's 112 heroes have made their way into the sequel. Each hero has a handful of unique abilities and generally works best in a specific role, such as supporting other players as Omniknight, roaming around the map looking for opportunistic kills as Spirit Breaker, or evolving throughout the course of the game into an all-powerful vehicle of carnage and destruction as Phantom Assassin.There's only one map, unlike in many other MOBA titles, although Valve has not ruled out the addition of more over time, and has previously offered game-changing modes with seasonal events at Halloween and Christmas. But Dota 2's single sprawling map sets itself apart from the competition by being larger, more intricate, and packed with greater detail than the rest of the genre. Unlike in League of Legends, the jungle area is riddled with far more tangling pathways, the lanes feature additional shops selling exclusive items, and savvy players are given more opportunities to use the environment to hide, flee, and ambush their opponents.There are multiple layers of additional information that become increasingly relevant as you invest more time in the game. How do you effectively divide your forces? When should your team attempt to vanquish Roshan, the map's most powerful creep? What are runes? What's the significance of the fact that creeps get slightly stronger every seven and a half minutes?Often the game's dizzying scale is seen as off-putting or simply too complex, but the truth of Dota is that it can be entertaining as a new player to just sit down and let all those extraneous factors play out around you. Getting down to the brass tacks of the game with a group of like-minded friends is a lot of fun: start by buying your characters' recommended items, try your best not to get caught out of position, and get into the habit of buying observer wards. And watch out for Riki.As you'd expect from Valve, this is a beautifully presented game, with the Half-Life and Portal maker running victory laps around its competition in terms of UI, voice acting, and showing how to deftly add real personality to its characters. Only recently has the developer turned its attention to gently easing new players into the proceedings, however, and even now, mastering the basics feels like learning to swim by jumping in at the deep end. Efforts are being made to remedy this, though: right now there are a couple of tutorial levels, some well-designed AI bots, and a newbie playlist that restricts hero selection to just 20 of the most frequently picked characters. And with community-created hero guides now built directly into the game itself, Dota 2 is much easier to get started with than it has been in the past.Play a match every evening for a couple of weeks, and you start to see how Dota 2's wealth of disparate systems and mechanics combine into their own harmony, and you begin to understand how there are hundreds of elements that affect the game. Dota 2 is a tense war of accumulation and attrition. The biggest problem, which is coincidentally where the real excitement of the game lies, comes from struggling to process and interpret dozens upon dozens of mitigating circumstances while simultaneously trying to keep your cool.It is a complicated and exhausting game, and for the first few weeks, it's challenging just keeping up with the general rhythm of a match. But invest enough time into Dota 2, and you develop an almost unconscious ability to keep up with the game--performing actions such as sending the slightly fiddly in-game courier over to the faraway ""secret"" shop to get some rare items, for instance. After a couple of hundred hours of Dota 2, what once felt like spinning plates just happens automatically.While Dota 2 has transferred the core of the original Dota into a cleaner, modern engine, the fact remains that losing is uniquely painful. Death in Dota 2 not only gives your opponent money, but robs you of some of your own and leaves you waiting up to a minute to respawn. By the time you've trudged back across the game's massive map--or spent money on a teleportation scroll--your opponent is now stronger and richer. Die two or three times in quick succession, which is easily done, and a match of Dota becomes a painful experience where you spend the next half hour getting bullied by an increasingly superior enemy. Other games in the genre have tried to mitigate this punishment, but Dota 2 positively revels in its complexities. The rich just get richer.Give it a go!"

655,"3,671.2",Recommended," February 7, 2014",6,"Is Dota 2 better than League of Legends? Not better, but something different. Both games have many similarities but also some differences in the way of playing. Hardcore fans of the original Wacraft 3-Modifkation Defense of the Ancients definitely feel at home because Dota 2 is practically only a technical remake of its predecessor. But even those who have over the years played League of Legends tired and looking for a new challenge in the genre, will find pleasure in the game. Genre newbies may take a look of course, especially since Dota 2 is Free-2Play. Beginners should expect frustration moments when it comes to first games against human opponents but despite the solid tutorials. Only if some experienced players come equal to each other, unfolds Dota 2 its full potential fun.For me, DotA 2 is the best MOBA and with his multitude of heroes and revised engine, significantly better than the outdated League of Legends.In addition, I think that DotA (in work with Steam) will become more and more players with the time.CAUTION: Makes you addicted to more.97/100"

They may work where they want, but they don't seem to realise that their ego musn't be the ONLY reason to do it. Time to switch to Overdroch(watch), LoL and Black Squad, and give my wallet directly to them instead of VolvO."

Yes i have the greed of drops no lying but this one is just kickass :D Different heroes their abilities and the items. <3 Heroes range from funny to creepy :D . Okay for those who will start new there are a few things. Just don't ignore the tutorial it's boring at first but really important. and do ask you friends while in game which item is good for which hero and go for easy heroes at first like Rikki or Razor, don't wish to make lots of kills at first just hang around your friends and towers and defend, it's generally a helping community, Start making friends when you understand the game better to make a team for when you have to play ranked matches. People do say go after the recommended items and it's right for when you start playing first but after that every item has an detailed explanation just go through them and with your gut feeling because it doesn't matter what skills the heroes have what matters is how you use their skills and no one knows it better than you yourself.Edit : I was a noob back then, still in the learning curve. Learn to play with the recommended built and spent ample amount of time in practice against bots to know more about the heroes, creating items and lanes, your picks have great impact on winning a game so learn about heroes and their counters. Don't just join a game without enough practice and ruin match for others if you are new to the game."

Everything is too small, the store is so barebones that I wasn't able to locate anything and had to search for items by spelling.

If you are new to the game DO NOT USE THE BUILDS YOU SEE PROS USE. They build SITUATIONALLY. The builds they use are not good for every situation. At all.Also if you do not take criticism well, Dota2 is not for you. The worst player on your team will blame you for everything that goes wrong.

Graphics are great, mechanics are great, and it is a fun time overall besides the general rudeness of other. There generally are very few bugs with the game and it generally runs very smoothly.If you are new I strongly recommend doing training before anything else, and playing against bots until you are fairly confident in yourself. It takes time for you to fully understand Dota, and no, you can not jump.

26,"1,936.5",Not Recommended," September 18, 2017",35,"Title: I played this game actively for 13 years.If you want a short review: play it only if you can tolerant of the broken match making system. Only if you are okay to lose due to your teammate's feeding/afk/attitude 40% of all the matches you plays. 80% of the time you will meet at least 1 toxic player in either your team or enermy team which influence the fairness of the game by their personal emotional abuse.If you want a full review from a 13 years-experience in-depth review to help you to decide whether to stay in Dota 2 or not, read on.I came across Dota Allstar (what it used to be called) on Warcraft3 somewhere between 2004- early 2005 on v5.84 where one healing salve cost 400gold, looks back from now it seems very stupid but back then 400gold for 400hp seem reasonable somehow. Back then there was no proper online platform for players (later it comes and Garena). I am one of the players who witness the birth of MOBA esport and Dota Allstar to Dota 2 in the past decade from the very beginning. I loved it, followed it, worshiped it, defended it when its challenged and most likely im the guy who argued with you on 9gag, youtube and reddit regarding the superiority of dota over LoL. 13 years of a loyal and active follower and now i am calmly and disappointedly quitting and disrecommending this game. The reason why i dont recommend this game now is mainly due to the lack of depth of this game at the current state. Yes i said it, Dota 2 lack of depth, obviously this game gonna take you a long time to have a fair understanding of all heros and items. The lack of depth i refers to as it will come to a stage where you will only have a very limited possible ways to enjoy the game. You can only enjoy dota2 either blaming yourself for not being good enough or accept the flaws in the system and ignores it, or even you can somehow take a free game or a troll game from enermy as motivation to keep playing. Basically the system now simply cant allows you truely/fairly enjoy this as a MULTIPLAYER game. Sure you might somehow enjoy it as a single player PC game in general but for a standard of a MULTIPLAYER game, this game simply has very limited reason allow you to enjoy playing it. And it certainly not gonna be a career for 99% of you too.Lets start with public/normal game, the nature of this game mode itself cant be changed. You either accept the imbalance player skills range among the 10 players in there or be angry over the same reason. Public/normal game = unbalance, end of story. You simply cant enjoy a game not because of the game itself but the player within it just having too wide skill range. And the point is, if it is a FPS game like King of the kill or PubG, you can actually out skill everybody, however this is a teamplay game, you cant win with only yourself being very high skill.Secondly, MMR games. MMR games eliminates the problem of unbalance skill, however due to the high seriousness of this game mode treated by players. Players in MMR games generally acting unnecessary serious, agressive, and judgemental. Which results to what commonly described as ""toxic"". And the main reason i quit after 13 years is because the rate of these players occur increased rapidly in the last 2 years. I guess it has direct correlation with The International events and the age of Dota 2 where it comes to a time when a large older group of player (any group older than currently newest joined player) advanced to a stage where they stop advancing for a while, hence they have a little higher non-critcal-game-changing-skill than the same ranked players but due to the nature of the internet intangibly interactions, subconsciously when you dont personally know your teammate, you will act rudely and judgemental when your teammate made a mistake in a high pressure environment and their mistake is highly related to your match result as well since you all are in a team. Player who dead first in a team fight engagement who is watching the fight, have much higher emotional reasons to ""flame"" their teammate's real-time decision making when things dont turn out in their favor, is part of the toxic attitude problem too.This problem is very difficult to solve since the Dev need to change the player attitude towards the game. Some simple example of how ONE toxic player could ruined the game for other 9 players whom each of them invested more than 30 minutes: fighting for middle lane = start feeding. Talking disrespectfully/arguing on teammate's mistake = start feeding or abandon or afk. These two factors are VERY common for me despite i am having high behaviour score: 9681 (assuming it works). No exaggeration but 4 in 5 games of mine in the last 1 - 1.5 years had at least some degree of toxic player at least 1 to 4 directly engaged with each other which ruined the game by influencing the game's progress with their significant personal emotional intervention.Thirdly, this problem is not that critical right now but in a long run will eventually kill the game. This refer as the problem of limited gamestyle. YES as famously said by professional player BIGDADDY: ""In dota, everything can work!"". However, any game above 4k MMR games fixed to a maximum 5 game style cycle. Hero pool of all 10 players became very limited for the purpose to maximize win rate. Results to a repeating game play style that fixed by the first 3 - 6 picked heros.Therefore, i said Dota 2 lack of depth in terms of the possible way to enjoy the game once you understand all the heros and items. Pub game = unbalance, MMR game = toxic. 2 possible way you can somewhat enjoy the game 1: you ignore all the flaws in system, painfully fighting your way in MMR and pub game, putting your time against the odd of having all 4 good teammates or even enermy if you are a honorable person. Or only play non-mainstream gamemode like random ability where very limited people queue for, or simply just enjoy arcade games which is almost unplayable due to lack of player in some server.Normally i think this is enough for a in-depth review, however considering i am quitting this game after such long dedication. I am gonna give some possible solution and my ideal game state where everybody can enjoy this game in many ways. These points gonna be simple, no in-depth explanation will be provided, experienced players should have a better understanding than new comers.- toxic player should have been punished a lot harder with their understanding of the exact reason. eg: once confirmed, 24 hours up to 7 days on LP should be implemented depending on the behaviour.- to solve limited gameplay style, largely modify heros to enlarge flexibility and variability on hero combination and uniqueness. Also increase game uncertainty on winning condition (make comback more frequent and quicker while maintaining current match time)- decrease the teamwork requirement (increase individualism)- make servers for popular top 10-20 arcade games and systematically manage them- add real-time/in-matching kicking function by system when an obvious negative behaviour is detected, eg: intentionally feeding- bring back the switch player option (helps to continue the game once players were kicked or left the game, at least helps some game where even number of player disconnected due to varies reasons)I know some of these suggestions required huge human & programming input and time, eg: smarter-punishment system, more flexible and variable game style (required much more intelligent/creative designs), servers for popular arcade, a real-time systematic kicking function. However with all the money Valve has made from Dota 2, i think it is 100% doable.After all, they are a for-profit company. As for a for-profit game, we can only push our luck since the drive is money.Thats why it makes me miss the good old days, when the drive is purely the joy that we will eventually have.24/11/2004 - 18/09/2017"

With a multitude of playable characters and none of them behind a paywall, your initial games can be overwhelming. The number of different systems is also intense, from Shops, Side Shops, Secret Shops, Lanes, Jungle farming, creep spawning/stacking, etc.. It can be too much.Thankfully the revamped tutorial actually helps in this aspect, letting new players gain a grasp of what's going on.Not to mention the numerous arcade games to help players gain an understanding of various systems without risking time in actual games.I highly recommend Dota."

Dota 2 is a game about Teamwork, being on your own and not talking or not being a team player will get you nowhere and you'll sure as hell get reported.Overall Dota 2 is a great game but you will get more and more angry from losing games and people being idiots/noobs. If were going to play Dota 2, I would highly recommend you get a friend or 2 to play with you.Quick tip: If you want to get better at playing Dota 2, Watch professional Dota 2 matches and learn the items and Heroes in the game. is the best bet."

But if you persevere, Dota 2 becomes one of the most rewarding and tense team-based multiplayer experiences anywhere in gaming. A fantastic free-to-play model.Dota 2 has become notorious even among its MOBA peers for its difficulty – and that’s totally justified. It’s a double-edged sword that leads to both a terrifying introduction and a world-class game at the highest levels.You should not expect to have fun your first day playing... or even your first week, maybe months. Dota 2 is a deeply layered construct of systems, and to survive you need to understand every single one and how they interact with one another. Everything from learning to work as a member of a coordinated team to the counter-intuitive practice of killing your own AI units to deny the enemy experience points and gold they’d get from doing it themselves, and understanding the effects of hundreds of abilities like Bloodseeker’s Rupture (which deals huge damage with every step you take) is a big barrier to entry. Even figuring out which of the 108 heroes fits you best is a time-consuming challenge.Your learning has just begun when you've settled on what roles, heroes, and builds suit you best – you also have to adapt based on what other players choose. If the other team plays a Riki, you need to compensate with an emphasis on detection. Go up against Bloodseeker and his hideously powerful Rupture will force you to carry around a Town Portal Scroll to get home.Shop System:Only cosmetic enhancements, almost all of which are created by the community. Tournament goodies (such as tickets for viewing live events) are for sale. There’s not a single paid on the in-game balance, and that’s great!In short words:Dota 2 pits two teams of five players against each other. mix of strategy and RPG, skill management and tactical gameplay.108 heroes, each with their own style and combat abilities.most heroes have 4 skills that can be increased in power by levelling up by killing enemys.there are over 120 items to choose from within each game, each with their own ways to power up your stats and active abilities.creeps that charge down the game's three lanes, and the player controlled heroes on the opposite team.There’s a huge time investment before you can enjoy a game. it creates a playing field where skill and teamplay is top priority.the best DotA game. many heroes, items and a great balance.Thanks for reading!

Or, you could take it seriously and get a ranking (MMR). Then when you get bored of that you can even try out some of the MANY mods there are, which require a good PC to run but its definately worth it. This game is hard to be good at, but you dont need to be good to have fun. Anyway, this game has taken countless hours of my life and i dont regret one second of it.Constant updates and changes keep the game interesting and fresh, adding to its allready insanely high replay value.Be sure to get into watching competitive games if your liking the game!Definately reconmend this game."

It has a replay which helps you to review your strengths and weaknesses aswell as your team plays.You are able to enjoy the skins of heroes along with other commodities given by the system.It has a report button which you should definitely use for people who treats other players wrong.And every step of the game helps you become the greatest player you become.Reasons why I somehow hate it:Time consumingWanna be professional players acting as warlords(degrades other players if they do a dumb move)Overall, the game is one of the enjoyable part in my teenage life"

68,"8,569.2",Recommended," January 17, 2015",4,"Dota has taught me a lot of things, you can only be good at something if you set your mind on it,learn from mistakes, be aware of your surroundings, trust your instinct, use common sense, trusting on your team to always have your back, believing in your capabilities, always try to be better than you were yesterday.After all, I recommend this game to everyone who wants to experience pain, suffering, and torment because at the end, you will come to a sudden realization that things are always bound to get better."
90,755.3,Not Recommended," March 28, 2013",4,"Four and a half years ago I wrote a negative review on this game, which can be viewed here.[pastebin.com] Pretty much everything I wrote in the review still applies, and in fact, much of what I said has been vindicated by the course the game has gone in my absence. But I figured that with all the changes dota's gone through, that I should give it a go experience the differences firsthand.As I alluded to in my first review, IceFrog, or whoever really makes the updates for Dota, is pretty much insane, and will change things constantly for seemingly no reason. I was more correct about this than I could have ever imagined, as the game has undergone a massive amount of changes since I left, and I don't think a single one of them, aside from the addition of new heroes, has actually made the game better. If anything, it's probably gotten worse.The short and true of it is this: When I played dota, the thing I most enjoyed was the fact that my every move made a difference towards the outcome of a match, and thinking of the many heroes in non -conventional ways (item builds, lane choices, etc) could result in anything from astonished amazement and victory, to unbelivably swift loss. The idea that my unconventional method of play could mean victory or defeat is what drove me to keep playing, and keep trying new things. That sort of decision making dota to me. Mask of Madness + Armlet Wisp is a triumph of dota. Fountain hooking is a triumph of dota.The thing I liked least about dota, besides the community, was the distinct lack of clarity towards the apparent importance of any given moment. In any other team game, even if my team gets massively stomped, I can pretty much always say with total certainty we lost a game. Similarly I can see we achieved victory if we do win. This is not the case with dota. The bulk of your time in each match flooded with white noise, this constant need to ask ""what the hell just happened?"" makes losses seem like even more like an incredible waste of your time when they are, in fact, 40+ minutes. When I played this game, I remember having so many days where I felt that the time I alloted to playing it was a complete waste of time. I could have used that time for literally anything else, and it would have been more productive.What I noticed almost immediately upon booting up dota again was that the thing I liked best about dota has gotten muddled and infrequent, and the thing I like least about dota has become pretty much perpetual. Recent updates to this game have added terrible gameplay elements like the bounty runes which force players to be in a specific spot at a specific time or they will be at a disadvantage. I hated this even back when it was just bounty runes in the river, now this kind of design is --tome of knowledge, bounty runes seperated from river runes, shrines.........oh my god, shrines. Unbelievably bad design there--the addition of free mana/health restores on the map makes it so that you pretty much always have to assume that the enemy team has full health and mana, which makes , most of which involves you getting hit by things that don't allow you to play the game, is constant, but actually people is harder and doesn't actually mean anything. Why is the laning phase even still a thing if it's impossible to kill people by attrition and everyone can just EXP in the shop? I lost faith in this game a long time ago, but holy crap. We're reaching TF2 levels of bad changes and depth decline.You'd think that talents--the ability to choose from two options once every 10 levels or so--would make my little speech about carving your own build even more fun. As any HotS player can tell you this is a lie, a trap--the ability to choose from two different options doesn't allow you to carve a meaningful identity, it's just a singular choice which tends to have a very obtuse and hard to parse impact on the game. This is why I say the white noise problem has gotten worse--cast range and cooldowns, two aspects of dota that you used to be able to change, are very commonly increased by talents, meaning you no longer have any ability to determine just how long a time period you to exploit an opening after a hero uses their ultimate, or how far away you need to stand to dodge it, etc. Then there's the classic obstructive stats--what does ""+15 Strength"" do? I know I get health, and maybe damage, but how much? Nevermind movement speed--there's so much free movement now that pretty much everyone is a miniature Bloodseeker, all the time.On the bright side, if you like teamfights, you're in for a pleasant surprise, as the game has pretty much devolved into being nothing but teamfights since laning and farming no longer matter and everyone is constantly at full health and mana with nothing on cooldown. But at some point you're gonna have to ask yourself: if that's what you want, why aren't you just playing Overwatch."

But if you persevere, Dota 2 becomes one of the most rewarding and tense team-based multiplayer experiences anywhere in gaming. A fantastic free-to-play model.Dota 2 has become notorious even among its MOBA peers for its difficulty – and that’s totally justified. It’s a double-edged sword that leads to both a terrifying introduction and a world-class game at the highest levels.You should not expect to have fun your first day playing... or even your first week, maybe months. Dota 2 is a deeply layered construct of systems, and to survive you need to understand every single one and how they interact with one another. Everything from learning to work as a member of a coordinated team to the counter-intuitive practice of killing your own AI units to deny the enemy experience points and gold they’d get from doing it themselves, and understanding the effects of hundreds of abilities like Bloodseeker’s Rupture (which deals huge damage with every step you take) is a big barrier to entry. Even figuring out which of the 108 heroes fits you best is a time-consuming challenge.Your learning has just begun when you've settled on what roles, heroes, and builds suit you best – you also have to adapt based on what other players choose. If the other team plays a Riki, you need to compensate with an emphasis on detection. Go up against Bloodseeker and his hideously powerful Rupture will force you to carry around a Town Portal Scroll to get home.Shop System:Only cosmetic enhancements, almost all of which are created by the community. Tournament goodies (such as tickets for viewing live events) are for sale. There’s not a single paid on the in-game balance, and that’s great!In short words:Dota 2 pits two teams of five players against each other. mix of strategy and RPG, skill management and tactical gameplay.108 heroes, each with their own style and combat abilities.most heroes have 4 skills that can be increased in power by levelling up by killing enemys.there are over 120 items to choose from within each game, each with their own ways to power up your stats and active abilities.creeps that charge down the game's three lanes, and the player controlled heroes on the opposite team.There’s a huge time investment before you can enjoy a game. it creates a playing field where skill and teamplay is top priority.the best DotA game. many heroes, items and a great balance.Thanks for reading!

5,"8,559.1",Recommended," July 20, 2014",4,"Dota 2 is complicated, exhausting, and sometimes cruel, but its many complexities form an incredibly satisfying and exciting multiplayer game.Deserves its intimidating reputation, and it probably won’t suit you if you’re looking to play casually. There’s a huge time investment before you can even enjoy a game, let alone feel competent at it. But once you start to learn its secrets, there’s a wild and exciting variety of play here that’s unmatched, even by its peers. It’s a challenge of knowledge as well as reflexes, and success is a rush. The fact that it’s completely and totally free to play in the way we wish all free-to-play games could be isn’t just one of the most generous propositions anywhere in gaming, it creates a level playing field where skill and cooperation is paramount. May the best team win."

One hour long game later, game could go either way, you nearly win and you lose? 1 hour of your life COMPLETELY WASTED!Don't even get me started on Ranked Matchmaking! You can't get anywhere with that. Raising your MMR. I can respect winning the odd game and losing the odd game. But the MMR loss to gain is INSANE! You could win 2 games in a row, with like 40-50 mmr gained. And lose it in just 1 game! How the heck are you supposed to climb it. These numbers might as well have been pulled out of a hat!

With a multitude of playable characters and none of them behind a paywall, your initial games can be overwhelming. The number of different systems is also intense, from Shops, Side Shops, Secret Shops, Lanes, Jungle farming, creep spawning/stacking, etc.. It can be too much.Thankfully the revamped tutorial actually helps in this aspect, letting new players gain a grasp of what's going on.Not to mention the numerous arcade games to help players gain an understanding of various systems without risking time in actual games.I highly recommend Dota."

The only requirement is that you should know the roles of the heroes and the items that they use, mostly by reading the dota 2 wiki [dota2.gamepedia.com] or watching videos of experienced players like from Youtube or Twitch. In order to enjoy the full potential of the game you should form a team with family or friends instead random people if that's possible. Free to play, with amazing graphics, music, sounds, voice acting and reqular updates, pretty balanced and with a big hero pool to choose from and more heroes to come in future. Also, like other Valve games, cosmetic items make their presence, giving you the ability to customize your heroes, by buying them (optionally) in order to support the community contributors and creators, or simply finding them from ingame free drops and trading with other players, or you can even create your own.10/10 would defend my Ancient again (and destroy my enemie's)."
335,741.2,Recommended," October 4, 2014",4,"Dota 2 is most likly the the best MOBA game out there, the unique artstyle of the game makes it the best with also the Heroes being very intresting and also there is no need to unlock Heroes *cough* League. *cough*But yea, if you want to play Dota 2 you will need to mentally prepare your self for a lot of hate and a lot of angry Russians saying to just uninstall Dota 2 and to never play it again. Dota 2 is a game about Teamwork, being on your own and not talking or not being a team player will get you nowhere and you'll sure as hell get reported.Overall Dota 2 is a great game but you will get more and more angry from losing games and people being idiots/noobs. If were going to play Dota 2, I would highly recommend you get a friend or 2 to play with you.Quick tip: If you want to get better at playing Dota 2, Watch professional Dota 2 matches and learn the items and Heroes in the game. is the best bet."

Most of the negative reviews come from players who have been playing this game over 1k hours and positive reviews come from people who have less than 300hours.After 2k hours of gameplay I gotta say with deep regret this last update (7.00) ruined the game. The HUD itself is poorly implemented. A lot of crucial features are missing. Since 2009 till today Dota has been about adding new heroes with new abilities, challenging old and very well crafted strategies, improving the experience over and over again. Sadly, after 7.0, the game has lost its learning curve, there are tons of ways to make money, to stay safe, to regain mana or xp. Classic heroes have been turned into something completely different, abilities are now a deformed and unbalanced version of what they were. It took YEARS to get a proper balanced between heroes but all that feedback, experience, knowledge is GONE. Dota 2 is now a crippled version of what it used to be, arguably similar to other MOBAS out there. And don't even get me started on kids...7.00 has turned the game into a playground for 12 year olds. Why? The short answer, this a new game and an easier version of what it used to be.Edit:Furthermore,New players don't really care for this game. They don't give two ogre magi sh*ts about it. Like their way of thinking is "" YES!! I don't suck anymore and everyone is as lost as I'am so woohoo great game!"" We on the other hand have spent THOUSANDS of hours playing it. In some cases mastering heroes and techniques but screw us right? Players who made this game into what it is today...I don't know who is rsponsable for this but to you sir or lady ""screw you too"" You have made a huge bargain with 7.00 Hard dedicated players who have invested not only hours but money into this game will leave, there are a ton of mobas out there. And I feel awful for saying this becuase for years I've stayed with dota and never even thought about trying LoL, HON, Heroes of the storm...the list goes on. So lets see how much casual players and 10 yearolds spent into this game after 7.00.Allow me to make a prediction, you'll realize you've made a huge mistake and give the community what they want maybe in a ""classic"" dota version of the game or you'll realize it too late and its byebye for sure.You are gonna end up charging money for heroes. I can see it now $20 for a ""Classic hero pack"" .... **SMH**Casual players and 12 year olds have ruined this game for good.R.I.P DOTA 2"

115,"1,793.2",Not Recommended," December 20, 2016",16,"If you are reading reviews do yourself a favor, check the number of hours of people who are reviewing the game within the last month, you'll start to see a pattern. Most of the negative reviews come from players who have been playing this game over 1k hours and positive reviews come from people who have less than 300hours.After 2k hours of gameplay I gotta say with deep regret this last update (7.00) ruined the game. The HUD itself is poorly implemented. A lot of crucial features are missing. Since 2009 till today Dota has been about adding new heroes with new abilities, challenging old and very well crafted strategies, improving the experience over and over again. Sadly, after 7.0, the game has lost its learning curve, there are tons of ways to make money, to stay safe, to regain mana or xp. Classic heroes have been turned into something completely different, abilities are now a deformed and unbalanced version of what they were. It took YEARS to get a proper balanced between heroes but all that feedback, experience, knowledge is GONE. Dota 2 is now a crippled version of what it used to be, arguably similar to other MOBAS out there. And don't even get me started on kids...7.00 has turned the game into a playground for 12 year olds. Why? The short answer, this a new game and an easier version of what it used to be.Edit:Furthermore,New players don't really care for this game. They don't give two ogre magi sh*ts about it. Like their way of thinking is "" YES!! I don't suck anymore and everyone is as lost as I'am so woohoo great game!"" We on the other hand have spent THOUSANDS of hours playing it. In some cases mastering heroes and techniques but screw us right? Players who made this game into what it is today...I don't know who is rsponsable for this but to you sir or lady ""screw you too"" You have made a huge bargain with 7.00 Hard dedicated players who have invested not only hours but money into this game will leave, there are a ton of mobas out there. And I feel awful for saying this becuase for years I've stayed with dota and never even thought about trying LoL, HON, Heroes of the storm...the list goes on. So lets see how much casual players and 10 yearolds spent into this game after 7.00.Allow me to make a prediction, you'll realize you've made a huge mistake and give the community what they want maybe in a ""classic"" dota version of the game or you'll realize it too late and its byebye for sure.You are gonna end up charging money for heroes. I can see it now $20 for a ""Classic hero pack"" .... **SMH**Casual players and 12 year olds have ruined this game for good.R.I.P DOTA 2"

111,93.9,Not Recommended," September 2, 2017",4,"Suggestion to Valve for new players: Suggest but don't restrict on what heros can be played. I love CM but it happens to not be in the restricted hero pool. Instead I can only ban and select a few heros that I really don't like playing. If new players want to ignore the suggestions, then that's their choice, but don't restrict mine.As for this game as a newer player on US West: Way too many non-english speakers that love to flame and claim elitist status but then fail to communicate to someone even when notified of newer players. I don't think thats going to change, and as a result I don't think the new player experience will ever improve until a player tortures themself to learn.Summary: If you're new to dota either find friends, torture yourself to play many matches until you find players you can play with. Or don't play dota, it's not very accessible and horribly explained."
323,356.1,Not Recommended," September 6, 2017",7,"After approximately 80 hours of gameplay (As of writing this review) I feel it is time I did a proper review of this game. Now, Dota 2 is a good game. It is fun to play, although it has a steep learning curve, it is a good game, and one I hope that I will spend many more hours to come playing. But I cannot, with good consciousness, recommend this game. Why? Well.....I have never seen a community as toxic as the one in this game, it is beyond proportions. I have played League of Legends, Heroes of Newerth, SMITE, Heroes of the Storm etc. etc. I have never experienced anything like this. For example, I was just in a match the other day. I warned my team in advance I was new to the game. I got a decent score for a newbie like me (5/6/4). But no no no no, apparently it was my fault our team lost and BAM. I got reported by three players as well as verbaly abused in-game.Now, I'm not saying that this should stop you from playing the game. Unless you are 12 years old, you should have enough mental strength to handle someone trashing you online x)What I am saying though, is that while Dota 2 is a great game, you might want to consider if you want to spend energy on dealing with the annoying community, instead of being able to focus on the gameplay and have fun. I will leave the choice to you.So sorry Valve (Not that I feel I owe you guys much these days anyways....), it's not on your part, but no... I cannot and will not recommend Dota 2."

It took all of the insane difficulty and learning curve and just made it fun and memorable, with different objectives, maps, and mercenaries to spice it up. In the end I had fun and made friends and funny moments, so it was worth my time.This, however, is not. Don't bother with this game until valve actually starts giving us something good, because when you pay your whole annual salary on digital skins or a pay to win style card game you're basically telling Valve ""I don't care what you do I'll give you money anyways""Gameplay wise the game is still a let down. The characters are horrendously unbalanced and the learning curve is so steep you might as well just watch other people play.Obviously the community is terrible, that much goes without saying, but the real point of saying that is because multiplayer games are fun because of the moments and friends you make, and competitive is a waste of time unless you're going to tournaments.

Unintentionally valve have came up with a brilliant tool to comprehend the angry sort of russian language for example ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Before trying a michael thomas or rossetta stone course consider dota for your soviet language learning experience.'Thanks, and have fun' ~Gabe NewellNow to be serious...Dota is extremely difficult to get your head around. To start, if you are new to moba's, you will be lost and somewhat overwhelmed by the gameplay. But as you advance in skill level and playing against rivals similar levels to you, you then realise how fun the game is. You will get raged at and you will fail, but that is whole point of improving. Dota is brilliant."

8,776.1,Not Recommended," December 15, 2016",4,"This game was very fun. This is the Game i used to play everyday because DOTA is the cure for my stress. But unfortunately, I lost interest in the game because of the new update 7.00. Here are some reasons:The new map is very confusing. The fountains in the Jungle are reasonable but the fountains in the base are not. Clashing in bases will be much more harder than usual. I honestly dont like the new rune places because it is (too) confusing and irrelevant. It should've been the way it was before, in the river. I have no concerns with Roshan. Everything else are new and different and it is not something i like getting used to. Map is very complex that's why it is a big NO.New HUD and Interface is very similar to LOL and I actually don't like it either. HUD is too small I almost can't read what is written on the skills or texts. I admit, the Interface is quite good-looking (ish) but it's not about that. it's about how clear the gamers can see on the screen and I believe that things are complex now and it seems so hard to interpret. Backpacks are good and very helpful but other than that, HUD and Interface is a big NO too.The new Talent tree is what i hate the most. Actually, the new aghanims upgrade on certain heroes are very unlikely too. Those aghs on certain heroes made the game very unbalanced because of the OP-ness on certain heroes. Just like what other gamers use to say, ""Game is broken"". I also believe that the talent tree is VERY irrelevant. Other talents are OP that's why the old ""stat upgrade"" is better.Honestly, I know that these things are probably for testing and I know that there are tons of bugs and things that needs to be fixed that's why I hope Icefrog/Valve would fix it asap. Those new features like talent trees, The new aghanims on certain heroes, Monkey King, (Sun Wukong) HUD and Interface and other things can still be fixed. Because things need to be balanced. Otherwise, people would dislike the game and DOTA will be lost forever. The Game is very good but for now, I dont recommend it. Game should be better than this or it should be like the old way with few improvements."

There’s a huge time investment before you can even enjoy a game, let alone feel competent at it. But once you start to learn its secrets, there’s a wild and exciting variety of play here that’s unmatched, even by its peers. It’s a challenge of knowledge as well as reflexes, and success is a rush. The fact that it’s completely and totally free to play in the way we wish all free-to-play games could be isn’t just one of the most generous propositions anywhere in gaming, it creates a level playing field where skill and cooperation is paramount.

15,"4,207.3",Recommended," September 8, 2017",329,"Reviewing a game negatively because you grew up as an entitled young yuppie who feels like half-life 3 should be personally released for you is just pathetic. I have never felt like writing a review but this is just stupid. So I have over 3000 hours on this game, and since I really don't care if anyone plays this or not, I'll give this review objectively and honestly.-Heroes are interesting, unique from each other, and fun to play.-The balance is very good, if you can play well you can do well with any heroes. You can carry with support, and support with carries, and many heroes are conducive in some way to any kind of playstyle, and it can be good. Some are more difficult than others, but is possible if you are good.-Casual game modes (unranked), competitive (ranked), and many different types of game modes.-The coding is very good, tight controls, wonderful graphics, efficient server-side (rarely lags), UI is brilliant, simple to understand but very deep-Interesting game mechanics, unnumerable strategies-IceFrog (creator and lead of game) follows stats closely and fixes any issues very quickly and scientifically. Has emotion involvement in the game, and it is palpable-Intense or relaxing as you want to make it-Very addicting to play, always a hero you will find very rewarding-All heroes are OP in their own way, which balances it out, makes them interesting-The report function is very intelligent and well-thought out, so if u are solo placed with 4 others, they can't all ban you and have you go to low-priority-The anti-hack coding is very, very good, and I have NEVER in my maybe 2.5k games played experienced a blatant hacker, neither on my team or on the other. It's a very, very positive experience in this aspect.-Don't ever have to pay a penny and have all heroes available and all modes.-Weekly tournaments that change your profile and let everyone know you have won (very intimidating in ranked games for opponents).So the negatives--There's are a lot of children who throw temper-tantrums because they don't get their way, or feel you made a mistake, etc. If you don't immediately mute them and just enjoy the game, you will get angry, tilt, and it will be reflected in the game. Once I learned that, the game became much more enjoyable. Often once they realize you don't care or that they are muted, they will just play, because let's be honest, no-one likes to lose, even trolls. However, realize that occasionally there will be nothing you can do and there will be that one guy who constantly runs up mid and dies 40 times on purpose. And you will have wasted 40 minutes of your time, doomed to lose from the start. The least satisfying and most infuriating experience in my gaming life.-Players paid to boost are not prevelant, but do exist, and will♥♥♥♥♥♥you-Peruvians, for some reason, are very vocal and over-bearing on the US servers. Apparently Peruvians get 3rd best connections to US east/west and are everywhere. Without stereotyping, in my own experience, their culture is simply ingratiating to most Americans. It's an aggressive,♥♥♥♥♥♥talking culture inherently, a cultural difference. Just like Koreans are almost always reserved and humble (always exceptions to any rule), so Peruvians are almost always the opposite of that. Sometimes you will be put on teams where nobody speaks English (however, in-game chat wheels translate your commands to other languages).-Game is a sadistic grind to achieve MMR. Will play an hour to get 15-30 mmr, could lose it next game in an hour long gank fest, and now you're back to where you've started, feeling like you just wasted your evening in the sense of MMR.-Must actively seek to learn optimized builds for heroes and recognize enemies spells to be more than moderately successful. This takes time, practice, and perhaps research, so the game can be a time-sink.TLDR: Gameplay is fun as♥♥♥♥♥♥ balanced, and rewarding. Use the mute button and you'll negate most of the negative experiences. Feeders happen occasionally, very frustrating, many Peruvians, need to put some time to be good.Caution: game is addicting and at times infuriating, but always satisfying when you out-skill opponents, and when you have a fun team game shines like the North Star in a dark sky of games."

210,"4,747.3",Recommended," November 8, 2013",15,"I started playing Dota 2 around 2 years ago, at that time it was still at Beta and I would never have expected that this game would greatly affect my life. When I started I did not have any experience and much expectation of the game, due to the genre - it was all new to me, however before trying out the game it took my friends awhile to get into the game because I did not like the fact the game was still at Beta and at that time I was detesting its predecessor “DotA” due to the fact the gameplay was confusing which it turned me off and also the graphics was years outdated without even trying the game out. I was able to give its successor a chance when a friend of mine introduced the ESports scene within the game community of the genre. I was hooked due to I never have expected that a type of sport has been running for almost a decade which it has been under my radar. I personally was not a fan for Sports in general although after hearing about ESports is completely change my perspective on both of the game and sports.ESports is a term for organized video game competitions, especially between professional. It is known as competitive gaming, professional gaming and cyber sport. The most common video game genres associated with electronic sports are real-time strategy, fighting, first-person shooter, and multiplayer online battle arena. Generally “Dota 2” would fall under the MOBA genre due to it consists of session-based online multiplayer matches, in which two teams of five players attempt to destroy their opponents' fortified strongholds known as Ancients. Each player controls a ""Hero"" character and, over the course of an individual game, focuses on improving their Hero's abilities, acquiring items, and fighting against the other team.“Welcome to Dota, You Suck”, is a well-known proverb within the DotA Community, which is aimed at new player. In fact is the truth, especially for new to the genre, for the first dozen hours or so, you will be showered with too much information and an often unforgiving community of extremely competitive players. On the other hand if you persevere, Dota 2 becomes one of the most rewarding and tense team-based multiplayer experiences anywhere in gaming. It's an achievement owed to uncompromising depth and complex gameplay, being a free-to-play, and the great features developer Valve has built up around it.That said, you should not expect to have fun on your first day playing... or even your first week. It is due to the unforgiving players within your team which expects you to do your job flawlessly although it is impossible even pro players can make a mistake, however there’s a method of this insanity. In order survive in Dota 2 you need to understand every single hero and mechanics and how they interact with one another. Everything from learning to work as a member of a coordinated team to the counter-intuitive practice of killing your own AI units to deny the enemy experience points and gold they’d get from doing it themselves, and understanding the effects of hundreds of complex abilities.There are 102 Dota 2 heroes (and counting) each consist of different abilities and mechanics and serves different roles from each other. For example Riki, is an melee Agility hero in which when he acquire his ultimate at level 6 he becomes permanent invisible, which is an obvious choice for most of new player. However there are various ways to counter an invisble heroes, this can be done by purchasing either a “Dust of Apperance, “Sentry Wards” or “Gem of true sight”, anyone can purschase these item during a game, making the game more balanced. In addition some heroes has an ability to track an invis heroes for a short period of time.In conclusion, DOTA 2 is fun and challenging and deeply rewarding unlike other games, and despite its vast popularity it still feels like a secret waiting to be discovered. It has clear visuals and more balance gameplay unlike League of Legends and has an incredible longevity"

210,"4,747.3",Recommended," November 8, 2013",15,"I started playing Dota 2 around 2 years ago, at that time it was still at Beta and I would never have expected that this game would greatly affect my life. When I started I did not have any experience and much expectation of the game, due to the genre - it was all new to me, however before trying out the game it took my friends awhile to get into the game because I did not like the fact the game was still at Beta and at that time I was detesting its predecessor “DotA” due to the fact the gameplay was confusing which it turned me off and also the graphics was years outdated without even trying the game out. I was able to give its successor a chance when a friend of mine introduced the ESports scene within the game community of the genre. I was hooked due to I never have expected that a type of sport has been running for almost a decade which it has been under my radar. I personally was not a fan for Sports in general although after hearing about ESports is completely change my perspective on both of the game and sports.ESports is a term for organized video game competitions, especially between professional. It is known as competitive gaming, professional gaming and cyber sport. The most common video game genres associated with electronic sports are real-time strategy, fighting, first-person shooter, and multiplayer online battle arena. Generally “Dota 2” would fall under the MOBA genre due to it consists of session-based online multiplayer matches, in which two teams of five players attempt to destroy their opponents' fortified strongholds known as Ancients. Each player controls a ""Hero"" character and, over the course of an individual game, focuses on improving their Hero's abilities, acquiring items, and fighting against the other team.“Welcome to Dota, You Suck”, is a well-known proverb within the DotA Community, which is aimed at new player. In fact is the truth, especially for new to the genre, for the first dozen hours or so, you will be showered with too much information and an often unforgiving community of extremely competitive players. On the other hand if you persevere, Dota 2 becomes one of the most rewarding and tense team-based multiplayer experiences anywhere in gaming. It's an achievement owed to uncompromising depth and complex gameplay, being a free-to-play, and the great features developer Valve has built up around it.That said, you should not expect to have fun on your first day playing... or even your first week. It is due to the unforgiving players within your team which expects you to do your job flawlessly although it is impossible even pro players can make a mistake, however there’s a method of this insanity. In order survive in Dota 2 you need to understand every single hero and mechanics and how they interact with one another. Everything from learning to work as a member of a coordinated team to the counter-intuitive practice of killing your own AI units to deny the enemy experience points and gold they’d get from doing it themselves, and understanding the effects of hundreds of complex abilities.There are 102 Dota 2 heroes (and counting) each consist of different abilities and mechanics and serves different roles from each other. For example Riki, is an melee Agility hero in which when he acquire his ultimate at level 6 he becomes permanent invisible, which is an obvious choice for most of new player. However there are various ways to counter an invisble heroes, this can be done by purchasing either a “Dust of Apperance, “Sentry Wards” or “Gem of true sight”, anyone can purschase these item during a game, making the game more balanced. In addition some heroes has an ability to track an invis heroes for a short period of time.In conclusion, DOTA 2 is fun and challenging and deeply rewarding unlike other games, and despite its vast popularity it still feels like a secret waiting to be discovered. It has clear visuals and more balance gameplay unlike League of Legends and has an incredible longevity"

308,"1,314.8",Recommended," February 16, 2015",5,"Defence of the Ancients 2 (DOTA2) is a MOBA game, where you are on 1 map, defending your dear ancient, and trying to break other team's ancient.Choose from more than 100 diffrent heroes with unique skills and playstyles, a hero you're going to controll and win the game. Every hero counters someone else. You may not notice it firstly but when you got into Dota 2 you'll start understanding that even the most ""OVERPOWERED"" hero RIKI (sarcasm ofcourse) can be countered with items worth of 200 and 180 gold.Choose your role: Do you like supporting? pick a hero that helps his team win the game. Do you like being Godlike at the end of the match and win 1v5? then you're a Carry. Supports and Carries are only 2 roles, but who are you? are you a jungling Support? are you a late / hard / semi Carry? or you are a Nuker? an Iniciator? well you'll decide that.Learn your hero: have a hero that fits you very well (or even TOO WELL) and use him to his 100%. Learn when to use your abillities, on who, and when.Know your enemy: in Dota 2, you'll need to think like the enemy. What would you do in this situation? where would you be? what items would you make? what items should I make to counter enemy's items?Know your weaknesses and your enemie's: Know which hero you need to pick in order to make your enemie's pick useless? (let's take a huge problem in low lvls, heros with invisibility will give you hard time. so why not take a hero that could make his invisibility useless?)That is Dota 2.-----------------------------------------------Now my opinion: this game is great for people who like to think fast in diffrent situations. Right now, it's the best MOBA game on the market. It's a lot better than LoL (by one reason: all heroes are free.) and a lot better than HoN and other clones of Dota 1.The only con about this game is the community. If you're Russian, you'll be threatened like an animal just because you are a Russian. A lot of people cry on the forums about simple things such as Drop rates, Low Priority and other nationals they don't like.Pros and cons:Cons:1. Very bad community (if not the worst).2. You need some time to understand 'what goes where' , if you take Dota 2 then you need to take it seriously.3. Some heroes are a bit hard to counter, but are still countered and could be won by right choices and teamwork.Pros:1. You will not win if you just charge the enemy, you need to use your mind and outsmart the enemy by counterpicking their heroes, using your hero(s) correctly or buying certain items (with gold you get in the match, DUH).2. ALL HEROES ARE FREE. You don't need to pay a cent in order to win, a smart player who have'nt spent a dime will EASLY win a player who is donating all of his life.3. By paying, you DO NOT get any bonuses that can change the game to your side, you don't get any HP or DAMAGE boosts. You can only buy cosmetic items that make your hero look better but be played at the same skill.---------------------------------------------------My raitings:Community: 3/10 (makes me cry).Gameplay: 10/10 (is filled with a lot of 'shiny' moments).Graphics: 10/10 Looks terrible with low settings but looks GREAT with max graphics (and weather effects).Story: 10/10 A lot of heroes came from WoW, many have deep biography and interesting personalities."

That's why a lot of people keep coming back, but I'm afraid that and the microtransactions are the only thing this game has going for itself. The community is bearable at best and a rage pounding machine full of undeserved hate at worst. Valve took steps to reduce this as best at they could but I don't think it's going to be fair grounds for everybody... ever. No one is ever happy, from nerfs that occur every time, tournament miscalculations, tickets that go nowhere and yes of course, the game itself. Everybody seems focused on their own stats and performance for the wrong reasons because they don't like to be told what to do and question the cooperative nature of the game. Hence you don't mean nothing to most players while they fight you about a lane, creep, courier usage and if you so happen to make a mistake they'll turn on you as fast as adder. The whole thing... is not worth it, you'll live happier without the Rage Sandbox simulator, and it took me 4 years to come to realize just that."

54,513.2,Recommended," November 9, 2017",5,"Dota 2 is a great game - with friends.It has a very steep learning curve, and is probably one of the most difficult MOBAs that exist. However, when you finally learn how the complex mechanics work, it can be quite fun when you pull off great ability combos, and get really cool players in a match.I would recommend getting a squad of at least three friends to play Dota 2, preferrably experienced players who are not quick to anger. Firstly, this will make your team more organised and efficient. Communication really comes in handy - I still remember one time when I was solo queueing and the rest of my team were speaking a language other than english, but we still managed to win, because they were all in a party, and were able to strategise fluidly. I just followed their lead, being your typical support.Secondly, it will be a safer learning environment for new players. If you ever enter a solo match, the chances are 50-50 that you will encounter at least one salty player in that match, who will berate his/her team for any small mistakes. However, there are also many patient veterans who will give constructive feedback, rather than say things like 'uninstall game. lol.' or 'noob team, dazzle bought 0 wards this game. commend me pls'. If you are in a party and you encounter salty players, your experienced friends should be able to defend you, and point out those salty players' mistakes, like how they were just jungling the whole game, or got items that were inadequate for the situation. You would be surprised at how defensive those nasty players can be when they get caught out. A friend of mine has saved me many times in such occasions in the past. You do also have to be careful of playing with friends - another friend of mine kept screaming at every little mistake the team made, including his own, making me regret ever entering a voice call with him. Make sure you pick friends that are extremely chill to play Dota 2 with, otherwise you are in for a rough ride.Dota 2 is quite a well made game, is proactively balanced - OP characters always get nerfed eventually (except for Phantom Assassin, I always vote to ban her in ranked matchmaking). As said before, it can be very fun when you get really cool people in a match, but frustrating if you get people who do not speak your language or salty players. If you constantly get the latter, you may want to take a break from the game for a while. It can be extremely bad for your sanity and temper in the long run, as I have learnt the hard way. I took a break from Dota 2 for a few months, unable to handle the stress, until I found out that the character I main, Oracle, got a powerful new talent.Just like many others have said, this game gets addictive once you get hooked into it, and you have to be careful not to let it get a negative hold of your life, or you are in for a world of mental scarring."

Study on learning a new set of skills to further your career. You could raise money for charity. You could be an aid worker for a foreign country and help improve the lives of others. You could even just play other games, you know, those ones sitting in your backlog, pushed aside by DotA 2.But you won't.You will always return to this game. The maximum you will learn from playing this game is how to insult others in various languages (mostly these languages will consist of Russian and Peruvian.). This game will become as much a part of your life as eating or blinking. Half the time you will not even remember having played DotA 2 on a certain day. It just becomes natural to you.If you start playing this game, you will become addicted.You will also spend obscene amounts of money on cosmetics. A quick chest purchase here, a few random items on the market there, and boom. Like me you'll have spent far too much on a game which needs no money spent on it. If you start DotA 2, not only will you be subjecting yourself to a motivation-destroying hobby, but also subjecting yourself to a wallet emptying one too.This game will take away your time, money and patience for others. You will become an angry person.Basically 10/10 GOTY All years"

333,"1,121.8",Not Recommended," September 20, 2016",227,"Dota 2 is one of the most spectacular MOBA games ever. It went through a lot of changes and updates. When I start playing Defence of the Ancient it wasn't that much donation and sets. But what we see now? The amount of sets is too damn high, the creators just makin' money, you can't even define the character by some of it's stuff. Also, sin not to mention the community. It is smth terrible and disgusting, I played only 50 games out of 1100 without trash talking about me and my relatives. Just think about it, is it normal? Dota 2 literally is like narcotic, you should pass a long way to stop playing it. I wasted 1,118.4 hours in the shuffle. It is the biggest regret in my life 'till now. Take thought, does this stupid game worth your own time, money and nerves? I don't think so and that's why I don't recommend this game to any of YOU!"
2,391.0,Not Recommended," December 29, 2013",29,"Have an urge to review this game with its latest situation.We had a down time during Christmas time... and lately it seems that the player(s) were more frustating than before (closed beta, invite-only period). Also the leavers and the disconnected players are more rampant now. Which make this game more and more unenjoyable now. Noob-calling, negative not-team-players and the blame games involved, yes those kind that you have to expect when playing with total strangers. You'll be wasting 30-45 or even 60+ minutes of your life, thanks to them, losing easily. So this time around, you have to prepare yourself mentally to face those kinds. :DGood thing is that they have implemented the local lobby feature, so that you can actually play locally within your LAN. Should be a very good game worthy of having a LAN party again.I like the balance changes they put into the game, the item changes and things that make the early games more ""fun"", but...I'm putting this as a ""No"" for those who play only with a friend or two. You better play this with a full five-person-team to fully enjoy this game and the time not wasted. Or perhaps due to its current state, players similar to me might not have the reason(s) on how to fully enjoy this game. Hope Valve and the team can continue to improve on this game more."

141,"1,870.6",Not Recommended," August 29, 2017",12,"Would seem to be a wrong time to post this review as people who have played 4 FREAKIN thousand hours of A game care about another game... but I Really only care about DOTA 2... I had to quit DOTA for some time cause of my exams and such but I still spent more than $150 for the compendium and bought it b4 actually going in for a match as i just loved this game that much... but after playing a couple of matches I realised how bad this game is now... we have lost more than 450K people(not cause HL3) and how the community is becomming even more toxic then it is... but I also realised there are ways to fix this1- Don't make everthing in a game based around 1 EVENT(TI) add more events.2- Make more mini games like the DARK MOON and SILTBREAKER both of which were quite enjoyable but I can't play them with my friend who can't spend like $10 on A game as he doesn't earn. So make more mini games which are free. Alternately u can use the Community MODS by asking them to redo the game for the Mini games counter.3- Reward players. DOTA is a great game with very great mechanics but its not rewarding 1 bit for players who don't spend money. Small gifts that it used to give was very good. Also something more like a small achievement Badge which we can display would be nice. There can also be Courier, wards, skins and such we get for playing A hero and doing X things with them. Annoucers for when we hit a rampage under 100 HP can be a very satisfying thing or a gem for dieing as soon as we blink is another thing.4- As we start DOTA we recieve a tutorial which explains very little which in of itself isn't a problem but the problem comes when I go into a game of DOTA with people who have played 100 more hours which is Unfair in and of itself but the real issue is i can't tell them that as I have a chat ban and they are more toxic then the waste US produces in a year. so the Chat Ban isn't a problem but the MM Algorithm is. Making the normal MM less punishing would be a nice addition as I play normal for my free time as a causal player and play MMR when i'm not that casual. but as a causal player i would like my team to be just as or only a little more serious then me while playing as i can't handle the pressure they give.( I hope u understand my point about the MM and Playstyle i wanna provide)6- The MM finder can ask us which role we'd like to play and give us a match in which we can play that role without having the whole team playing carry against a whole team playing support.5- Add more things which are FREEE!! and more patches more heroes more modes more achivements more lore deatils more EVERTHING! i know thats alot but i think if u guys just ask then more then A million people will give u ideas and atleast 800 of them will help u implement it.6- Remove the bugs... I know that u guys are constantly teasting and removing bugs but there is still the naked hero bug from REBORN( should be 6.87?) i know that visual bugs arent a big deal as they don't affect game play.. but a friend of mine who was playing his 3-4 match got this bug and litrally said that the game isn't consistant so he won't actually play this.. And the visual bugs during replays are far too many to count...So i implore u to ask us or let us help u wherever we can... u have a good game with few good people in it... Ask us and this game will be great... remember this THE PEOPLE MAKE THE GAME.If anyone from valve acknowledges this and does even half of what i mentioned above i'll RECOOMENED this game. But for now i don't recommend playing this game.P.S I know about the DUELING FATES update comming soon... But I would like to remind u that we get this update after almost a year(9 months I know).. I also know valve annouced more tornaments next year but we don't know how they'll affect the game or any at all so my fix still applies...P.P.S I do love the idea of a DOTA card game so that isn't a issue i belive needs a fix instead i belive the card game will bring more players to DOTA if they know how to do their part of the job.P.P.P.S I HAVE NOT PLAYED HL OR ANY OF ITS FRANCISE SO I'M NOT PART OF THE SPAM NEGATIVE COMMENTS. I JUST HAPPEN TO POST MY NEGATIVE COMMENT AT THIS TIME...Also me not asking to improve the community is mainly because i'm a part of it and i'm well behaved people around me will also be but the other part of me knows that community is not nice and theres no point in complaining about it.I'll update this reveiw everytime i think about somthing which can be improved in this game according to me i.e.Update1- The small achivement has been added and we appriciate it very much."

I believe that you can never learn common sense, you are born with that talent. You should hire developers that have common sense if you want this game of yours appreciated by dota2 and non dota2 players.

The new hud looks so cluttered yet shows the half of the information the old hud showed. And all the information needed is so smal that u need to get closer to the screen to see. I used to love this game but now I spent the quarter of the time i used to play and it is getting even smaller, maybe thats a good thing.I used to buy items form the shops within seconds. I used to see my stats easily. I used to enjoy my loading screens and hud skins. I didnt have to come closer to the screen to see base damage attack speed and movement speed.Long story short the new UI sucks and made the game so unplayable and unenjoyable.

74,"6,170.2",Recommended," November 24, 2017",2,"Before deciding to read this review and/or play the game, this game has a very steep learning curve. You need to spend quite a bit of time before even having an idea of how the game functions. 4 years in and I'm still not 100% sure what happens in most games. If highly competitive/extremely good co-op/complicated strategy games appeal to you, this is THE ONE.If any of you have heard the term esports, you probably know the other big names like LoL, CS:GO and er.... yea that's about it. The reason as to why dota and (probably) these other 2 games are leagues above the likes of fifa and heartstone is simply at how well teamplay is encouraged, Dota in particular is a game where teamwork plays an absolutely crucial role, sometimes more than individual skill or advantages like hero picks, gold leads, xp leads.For the guys who have never heard of this before, think of it as a combination of chess and basketball, RTS style. You have to destroy the opponent's throne before they destroy yours. Dota like LoL and CS:GO is a 5v5 game. Like LoL and other mobas it is played on 3 lanes with the goal of killing a throne(called Ancient, hence Defense Of The Ancients). There are 115 characters to choose from, all completely free. Most of the characters have between 4 and 6 spells, with an exception having 14 spells.The hero matchups have lots of synergy and counter potential, spell interaction is a thing of beauty in this moba, as many interactions require a mind that is capable of understanding the spells in question and being able to creatively analyse what are the possibilities. And then once the combination occurs, you will learn from it and remember that. The entire game is a learning experience, you learn something new everyday. Even the pros aren't 100%. There's always this one interaction, this one combo that even pros wouldn't have thought of.The specific term for games like dota, lol, smite and other similar games is MOBA(Multiplayer Online Battle Arena). Dota 1 released on Feb 28th 2005. The dota 2 closed beta started on 17th Aug 2011 and the public release was on 9th July 2013. That's a long history of over 12 years. In fact, the only game that has lasted longer is counter-strike, with the original releasing on 8th Nov 2000. To have 2 of the 3 biggest esports under their belt and for keeping the gmae itself alive for a long time, Valve must be doing SOMETHING right that the likes of blizzard, EA and the rest aren't.As for dota 2, the advantage that it has over other esports and moba is that it is 100% free. CS:GO costs $15, LoL is free but requires you to pay for unlocking heroes unless u wanna grind em. However in dota, you get all 115(as of now) characters free of charge. The only purchases you can make are pure cosmetic ones which only change how a hero or a spell looks but doesn't improve the hero or spell itself. There is no way you can pay for an advantage. There are no excuses in this game, despite the billion excuses players make.Dota 2 values skill just like other games, but not just skill. Social skills, communication skills, leadership skills, creative thinking, objective thinking, control over one's emotions, conceptial knowledge, strategy and tactics. All of these play a role. Even if you're this amazing player with a 60% winrate wihtout communicating with your team or doing it properly, learning to communicate well with your team can bump that up to 70 or 80. And poor communication/ flaming/raging could easily drop that to 40 or 50. Dota is a game that constantly reminds you that the other 9 people in the game are human. Someone looking to truly improve will, ultimately, in the long run, choose to treat his teammates with respect without flaming even when they ♥♥♥♥ up and instead do their best to win their game from their perspective instead of just blaming a teammate. In the end, this is the realization that most of the top players come to.The game is being balanced and updated constantly and pretty well done. 12 years of keeping a game balanced and still introducing new content day by day. The updates might feel weird and some of them might make the community rage but that's mostly due to the fact that people think about all possibilities whenever an update is about to drop and the changes are sometimes unfathomable and the change could be very scary. In the end we all come to terms with it and just play the game. That's why I chose to nominate this award for the ""The No Apologies"" Award, even if the ""It Haunts My Dreams"", as I can never,ever stop thinking about it, and the ""Labor Of Love"", as the dev team is doing an amazing job of keeping the game well updated and relevant, also apply to it pretty well."

594,443.9,Recommended," August 9, 2014",2,"Who would have thought that a mod for a popular strategy game would give birth to a subgenre of strategy games that ended up as the most popular and most prestigious form of competitive PC gaming. The original DOTA was a mod for Warcraft 3. Dota 2 is the sequel where most of the original heroes made a comeback despite the game being developed by Valve themselves instead of Blizzard. Two teams of 5 competiting to bring down the enemy team's Ancient. Simple sounding, but Dota 2 is not a simple game. It is probably the most difficult and most aggressive MOBA currently.The game itself is good. Graphics are nice and most PC rigs would be able to support it nicely. It however, takes time, A LOT of time to learn to play each one of the heroes properly. When things go down to the wire, it gets really, really hairy. Only the ones who make the most of what items they have and using the right abilities at the right time would come away as the victors. And when you do win, it is one of the best feelings in the game. The heroes or champions in the game are as different as they can be from one another and each one of them has a different job to do in the in a team. Not only that, they do look awesome as well.But Dota 2 isn't perfect, far from it, actually. Mostly it has to do witht the community. You think CoD's fanbase was bad, play Dota and you'll think different. Trolls, whiners, noobs and really dumb people are common in the public matches and it is them who bring down the fun experience in the game. Also, Dota 2 is a free game so you can bet people with bad connections or bad PCs would try to play the game though and what happens is a cluster**** of annoyances as certain heroes and their abilities require precise timing.Dota 2 isn't the best game of all time (definitely not). But it is a timesink for those who'd love a challenge or want to be a part of something large in the PC gaming community. I personally spent more than 300 hours in the game as of this review and I am thinking of taking a break as Dota made me neglect my other games. But whether I quit or not, Dota 2 was fun while I still played it, despite experiencing plenty crappy moments."

Now in Dota 2 there are many Ganking Heroes in the game like; Pudge with his Hook, Sand King with his ulti+Blink Dagger, e.t.c....

126,"5,964.6",Recommended," May 22, 2013",2,"Dota came from a custom game in warcraft 3 and has evolved into a lifestyle. As one of the biggest games in E-sports in the world the 5 on 5 team battles are never the same. Fun to play and fun to watch this game has literally thousands of hours of value. Valve supplies seasonal activities and special game modes as well as relatively consistant updates containing purchaseable cosmetic items add value to this already quality game. Ice Frog, the games original designer in warcraft 3, still balances, rebalances and rebuilds heroes, items, the map, and even the games physics making the game ever evolving and never stale. In addition once a year Valve holds the Dota 2 International tournement which is arguably the biggest event in e-sports averaging now over $10 million prize pools, bringing together the best players and teams in the world for an event comparable to any major sporting championship. On route to be the biggest E-sport in the world and validating E-sports as a whole, the last international being tracked/covered by ESPN, Dota 2 might be considered the most influential game in E-sports. Having said all that, Do I recommend this game? Yes, for both casual and serious gamers, Dota4Life."

OFC!But DOTA2 shouldn't be like this. Not like HS or LOL, most of dota2 heroes could play multiple positions. Like VS, ACH, LINA, AA, SD etc.But with this stupid skill recommendation system, new players will only try one skill set. Nobody will read those guide which written by other players, cuz the plus system is much more convenient.2, let's talk about ganking. We all know that some special heroes, like SB and riki, could left the lane from the first min and try early gank all the time. But under this stupid plus, you really think new players will left the guide they provide? HELL NO, cuz the PLUS told them stay in lane and get exp.My suggestion is:1, keep the hero level system, for free, or maybe charge it for a higher price, like $10 forever?2, keep the new league ticket, charge it for each month or each seasonCANCEL ALL THE GOD DAMN PLUS SERVICE PLS."

Later the game become more important and hard your choice become.Like chess no two Dota games are the same (in chess may be but in dota never :P).At pubs Dota is more like knowing your enemy and read his brain/movements, predicting what someone will do next is always fun. So, dota pubs are great place to have fun.When playing serious one in every few game will make u forget the world around you and become the hero u are playing, each movement is like u moving yourself.Dota taught us team play, trusting someone basis of the his movements (behavior) and without words .No good game can be won without a good team play, One hero makes a difference but can never wins a game alone.All gamer want a place where they can use their smartness and resourcefulness, dota is the platform."

222,268.0,Recommended," December 15, 2013",2,"Dota 2 can be tough to get into depending on personal play style, which heroes you start off trying -- took me about a week to find my primary due to the boatloads of heroes available -- and the skill of those you get paired with when you're not playing with friends. It is so very worth it, though. When you're playing a hero you're comfortable with alongside a few good allies even a loss can be exhilaratingly fun as you force your enemy to earn their victory. And of course winning certainly isn't half bad, either. While the nuances of the heroes and whom plays best against whom and where may take a while to sort out, however, the base game is simple to learn.--Runs great even on a laptop.--All heroes playable from the start with new ones added all the time.--Multiple game types provide variety. Tired of the standard ""all pick""? Try randomly assigned heroes. Or give ""least played"" mode a whirl and watch the mayhem play out as you and nine other people all try to play heroes that you don't have the first clue how to use. Prepare to see lots of ""oops"" and ""oh, so THAT's what that does"". And ""sorry"". So, so much ""sorry"".--Great graphics (especially for the genre).--Music, sound effects and voices get high marks.--Paid items have no effect on gameplay beyond the purely cosmetic.--Pretty much anything that you can buy can be earned for free (at random) from simply playing the game or can be trade for with other players.--Custom huds and announcers can be bought, randomly received after games or traded for to tailor the look and sound of your game to your tastes. What's more, they're shared during matches; If one person in the match owns a given hud or announcer then EVERY person in the match will have access to it for that game. It's not unusual to see nearly a dozen available during a game.--Special holiday game types are always a lot of fun and the developers aren't afraid to really shake things up for them, even adding new ingame items and altering hero abilities. Of course standard matches are still available during these times.--Updates, while very frequent, are usually so small that they rarely take longer than five minutes at most to complete."

I've been playing this game since before it came out (Dota 1).The mother of all MOBAs, this game has it all: a talking tree, an aviary mage, a fallen God, dragons, undead, a horseman, knights... you name it!It's punishing as ♥♥♥♥ and that's part of its charm. People mention Dark Souls when they wanna talk about a hard game, but that can barely hold a candle to Dota 2. You die, you lose gold, you're not gaining experience which means your opponents are farming and leveling much faster than you.Dota 2 is a game about you mainly. If you want to improve, you'll have to keep trying again and again. It's also a very personal game. You decide what to get, you decide what role you'll play. You may follow a guide to the letter, but ultimately your playstyle is what will determine if you win or not.The community is colorful, just like any multiplayer community. You have the good guys, the team-leaders, the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, the Russians. Dota 2 is a team game, if you're not willing to cooperate or compromise, you're not gonna do too well.If you plan on nit-picking on every single thing another player does, this game will be absolute hell for you, and for anyone unlucky enough to play with you."

I recommend moving to another moba game like league of legends, even if it's a ripoff by riot games, it has more potential and care for bugfixing. and design of new updates is fine.I decline recommending this game as a whole.

I could go on forever talking about how amazing this game is, but I simply don't have the time. So what I will say, is that you cannot have Steam, and not play, or at least try this game."

65,777.5,Recommended," April 4, 2015",2,"This is an AMAZING game.Ill run down some good things and bad thingsGood things:All heroes are free, so there isn't anything like pay 2 win or something like in Legue of Legends.All heroes are balanced, and yeah there are some really good heroes too, but that's in every game.There are a lot of different game modes, and some even where you can make your own hero!There's a mute and report button so that you can report very anoying people, since it's a full on team game.You can get free items by winning. These are fully cosmetic, but are really cool! just like in many other steam games, you can sell those items and make money! I've made a few dollars, so it's not to mutch, but just a small extra.There's a bot mode where you can train new heroes.Bad things:The players are many times anoying. (But then there's the mute and report button)There arn't a LOT of heroes, but plenty.Language detector doesn't work (wich means you will play with a lot of people that speak a differnt language than you)If you play with friends that are a higher lvl than you, you will get to play in that high lvl too, wich will be really hard.That was basicly it. I reallly like this FREE TO PLAY game, i've got 280 hours of play time in to it, but ill shurely play it a lot more"
