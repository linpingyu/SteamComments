It didn't help. You'll get your turn.I do not recommend this game until R* gets their act together.Edit:I'd like to add that buying the game for single player is absolutely worth it, but online is simply a mess.It's been 3 weeks now and R* refuses to acknowledge their error, so I stopped playing and caring. There's no point in playing online if R* can steal your legitimate money away at any time. And the irony is that legitimate players are getting hurt while cheaters are unaffected.I will never buy another R* game again and I doubt I am the only one. The way they treat their players is ghastly. Their support desk is insulting. It's all about the money, now more than ever."

Buying on sale for the single player even if you never go online.... worth it.GTA V Online.Well, where do I start. The online part of the game leaves you rattling round in public lobbies trying to grind away the cash to buy anything fun, then more stuff comes out that looks fun and you spend more time grinding for that. Commonly griefed while doing it, often hassled by modders and frequently stuck in the clouds.Of course there is stuff like the pvp arenas, all the racing types and heists that can be done without joining a crew as well.But, find a good crew..... and all that changes. With a good crew you can help each other make money, kick the griefers out of sessions, roleplay a motorcycle gang riding around in leather and the game becomes a lot better. Like most online games, finding decent people to play online with makes all the difference.Rockstar SupportNo review of GTA would be complete without a quick look at R* support. Yes the online game has a modder problem, so yes a fairly aggressive anti-cheat is welcome...... regrettably it sometimes functions like a rabid dog and bites whoever it sees.... and from late on 24th to 26th March 2018 it bit a lot.24th - A bit of code is updated, thousands of people start getting banned for 30 and accounts wiped.25th - The bans continue, thousands and thousands of bans and accounts wiped, thousands of hours of gameplay gone. No word from R* about it, support tickets relating to bans autoclosed with a polite ""f**k off reply""26th - Bit of code changed on 24th changed back, no word from R*, media gets hold of it, steam reviews tanked. No new bans28th - People still banned, no word from R*, support tickets relating to bans no longer autoclosed. So yeah, that's progress.29th - So R* has started lifting the false bans, which is great, the downside, when they log in they are getting autobanned again. The mess continues.So finally, about a week after people got banned, and unbanned and banned again everything is getting sorted out. I was lucky, I got told what was happening so I didn't log in.Now a lot of people say ""cheaters always whine about getting banned hahahahaha"", but these are people I play with every day, in a crew specifically focused on avoiding cheaters, people I trust in a crew I trust.GTA is a genuinely great game at times, frustrating at others, and a miserable piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥when you have to try dealing with R* themselves.Single player 10/10Online 5/10 rising to 8/10 with a decent crew.Support and respect for their customers 0/10, nothing, nada, f**k all."

Some people lost 150k, some lost 20+ million. This is not PC exclusive, people lost money on PS and XBOX too.I'm not saying all these people are innocent but i know i've been playing my *ss off (activity;280 hours past 2 weeks) but apperantly they don't like it when you earn too much. I still have decent amount of money, but that doesn't change the fact that they stole cash from my account out of nowhere. Too much real life parody there.I lost millions because of the business bugs, glitches. (Supplies never arrive, 75k worth of supplies produce 63k worth of product, no production even though business is active etc...)I lost millions because Import/Export bugs. (Vehicle starts burning for no reason, sometimes 15 minute delivery timer reduces itself to 2-3 minutes. When you're about to sell, a long loading screen then cars are gone or invisible,etc... )I lost hours, when you're done with a sale, sometimes you receive ""Transaction Error, price is invalid."" or ""Transaction error, too much activity in your account."" I'm sure that was suppose to be against modders. Guess what? I play legit, i get an error. In the next session a modder's dropping 50k cash every 30 seconds. What happened to my business? I lost some of my product, recieved no money. I can try selling it again and hope i won't get any errors this time.What about Rockstar Support?They're worse than Nexon.Nexon doesn't give a sh*t.Rockstar doesn't give a sh*t plus they damage your in-game experience.I sent about six tickets, i got three different responses. No, it's not because they ignore your ticket. They have a support catalog or something where they copy&paste the best answer for your question.Please take a look at these responses. These are real.Response for the transaction errors. ""We're good, your connection is sh*t, go away"" response;Response for the lost Import/Export vehicles. I don't know what to think about this;Reponse for the second lost Import/Export vehicles. Now, there're a lot of scumbag youtube ""content creators"" out there. They give people tips on ""How to get free cash from Rockstar Support"" you know, clickbait bullsh*t.Now, i get this treatment because of that.This is Rockstar Support for you.I've had similar issues last year, but they actually helped back then, sent me the money i lost and stuff. I don't know what changed this year.""Oh, you've played 1800 hours, you got your money's worth."" That's not how it works. That playtime includes loading screens, connection errors and my no-life grinding... They make truckloads of money from Shark Cards and they keep releasing new content. But with every new update, the game gets more outrageous and exploitative.Shark Card prices weren't enough. OpenIV scandal, ridiculous drip feeding content and now this.DLCs in this game are NOT free unless you play (grind) 5-6 hours a day.The fandoms on Rockstar forums are pathetic.This game is not worth it, even for single player. They still haven't released a single thing for the single player.Do not support this corporate nonsense.I'd say it's a shame because the game is really good but nope, i have nothing good to say.Stay away from this company.Update: Now they constantly change vehicle stats, can you guess why? They released a supercar that costs 2.4 million. It was faster than anything else in it's class, but for a week. It's third now. Again, more exploitative behaviour from Rockstar..If you have any doubts, read the review comments."

So even when they ban people fo no reason: tough luck.Not to mention, do you know what I'll find when I log on a month later, all of my hard work reset back to nothing?

I can honestly say with full confidence this game is the epitome of every disease you can think of. The online mode is where this game really shines (or WOULD shine) other than the blockbuster-like story in single player mode, and crazy Trevor of course. But see, that's just the problem..... everybody plays the online mode, but it's so terrible, the community is toxic as f*ck, and the loading screens... for f*cks sake. Hold on, Let me create this list of bullsh*t for you real quick:1. Loading screens take forever.2. One of the most toxic communities I've ever seen, literally feels like you're playing with 9 year old kids. Not even joking.3. Bored players who will constantly f*ck with you and ruin your fun so that you can't get anything done.4. Everything is EXPENSIVE as all hell and it's extremely time consuming to make money, and you can hardly even do that without d*ckheads constantly trying to kill you and blow up your product, which is really stupid because they don't really get much of a reward out of it at all, so it further proves that they just do it to be a d*ck.5. There are HACKERS literally EVERYWHERE in this game, and they will do crazy sh*t such as spawn a ton of money in your account for no reason (which can apparently get you banned, how f*cking ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is that?) or spawn all the players on the map onto a roof top and then blow them all up with a missile.They give ZERO f*cks, and are quite annoying.6. The f*cking loading screens X___X7. You can play a Solo session, or with your friends only.... but you're not allowed to do any actual CEO or MC club work, etc without being in a public session full of d*ckheads, which makes money making almost impossible when you got mother f*ckers flying around in jets trolling everyone, blowing your sh*t up.8. You have to constantly jump from session to session, in hopes that you'll get away from said d*ckheads and can actually get some sh*t done in peace.9. And I mean the community is so toxic, I've never seen so much hostility and name calling in a video game in my life, jesus christ.......... nobody gives a f*ck about anybody or anything in this game. I mean yeah it's GTA, but the people on here get a bit ridiculous most of the time I'll be honest.10. It doesn't matter how big your gang/ crew is, all it takes is one d*ckhead with a rocket launcher or a jet to blow up your plane or truck full of cargo worth hundreds of thousands of dollars that you wasted half your f*cking day trying to make.11. I'm sure there's a couple more things I missed on this list of bullsh*t but whatever.12. This game almost drove me to the edge of insanity. I'm 27 years old, I don't need this bullsh*t right now, I need to take a break lol.13. I'll come back to it some other time, but if you, the person reading this, plans on buying it and trying it out for the online mode...... then be prepared for all the bullsh*t I just talked about, unless of course you're just some bored 11 year old turd (or grown man for all I know) that wants to get on and troll people, then by all means go right ahead, if that makes you feel better about your life.14. Oh wait, the heists..... man f*ck heists, I'm not waiting 10 years (literally) for players that are level 587 to join the lobby only to suck a** anyways and fail the heists every single time. It's bad enough low level players do which is to be expected, but man when you're that high of a level.... c'mon now. (And yes I'm being serious, though it isn't always this bad, but it can be).15. And shark cards can gobble my balls._________________________________________________________________Other than that, this game is an awesome game and very addicting, totally worth the money, you'll have tons of fun, especially in online mode, I promise :D"

I had decided to set myself goal of earning enough money through CEO Jobs and Biker Work to buy a Super Yacht. After a few days of grinding I logged on and found I had been banned. I checked my email and found an agressively vague non-specific email telling me I had violated Rockstars EULA and I had been banned from GTAOnline for one month.At first I was fairly okay with this, it was one month, and sometimes these things happen. Then I found out that I had my character stats, profile, money and assets wiped out. So I left a ticket on Rockstar social club querying this and attemping to appeal the ban and got back a generic reply that I had violated the EULA and the ban is final.I have spent the last month sending in tickets, asking different questions trying to at the very least pinpoint what my violation of the terms of service was. I have yet to recieve anything except identical replies, all giving me the exact same vague information that I had violated the EULA and had been banned and that all bans were final. I tried calling up Rockstar technical support (which I only found the phone number for my country on Reddit - thanks to who ever posted that), and the person on the phone read me the EXACT same reply I got by email and then proceeded to hang up.At the very least Rockstar has some horrible customer service. At worst, they are deliberately obstructing and willfully ignoring the compaints of paying customers. No automated ban system is flawless, and prior to this I would have agreed that people claiming false bans are just whining cheaters. But now I believe that there is at least a minority of banned players who have been banned for no valid reason, have had hours upon hours of gameplay wiped and have no recourse to appeal the bans. There are victory stories from before Rockstar updated their ban policy mid-2016 when people had been able to appeal the bans due to false-positives, and this at least shows that the automated ban system is flawed.Let me be clear: I couldn't even find out what I did to earn the ban, let alone be given the chance to refute it.So: if you want this game for singleplayer, go for it. It's good. Story isn't as tight as GTAIV but the gameplay has improved greatly. But if you want to buy GTAV for Online only, think twice; because you may end up having hundreds of invested hours wiped out for no apparent reason, and have no way to even appeal or find out why.Some links."
262,33.9,Not Recommended," June 15, 2017",99,"Take-Two just killed the modding scene for this game dead.Open IV was the main mod that modders used to make their mods. Mods that allowed you to do fun things in the single player like spawning in jets or turning yourself into Homer Simpson and driving his car around or enabling moon gravity. I say WAS because Take-Two issued a cease and desist to the mod author. The mod author couldn't fight it, so they stopped distribution of Open IV.The likely reason Take-Two killed this mod that only affects the single player is because there are vehicles in the (god-awful microtransaction hell) online mode that aren't available in the single player. This mod is used for mods that allow you to spawn those vehicles into the single player. Take-Two dislike this because they want to push people to play the inferior online mode because that's where all the microtransactions are. The online is missing a lot of features from the single player but it's the only place you can pilot the Hydra jet, for example. Oh, you actually want to pilot the Hydra jet? You'll have to grind for cash for days or buy it for real money.It's worth noting the single player story for this game is actually great, but the sudden absence of mods is disappointing, the way Take-Two treat it's modding community is disgusting and they way they see their player base is just insulting. All because they weren't happy to have only the fourth best selling game of all time.""We are convinced that we are probably from an industry view undermonetizing on a per-user basis. There is wood to chop because I think we can do more, and we can do more without interfering with our strategy of being the most creative and our ethical approach, which is delighting consumers."" -Strauss Zelnick, Take-Two CEO.""But we're not trying to optimize the monetization of everything we do to the nth degree.

41,927.2,Not Recommended, March 12,1,"When I bought this game on Jul 6, 2015, and played it for the first time it seemed amazing. There weren't that many cheaters around, Rockstar weren't pushing their shark cards so hard yet. The amount of money needed to get something was considerate. Like top apartments were $200'000, cars cost hardly over $500'000 and you could easily get your first million simply by playing each heist just one time.Then bikers came out introducing new ways of making money with biker businesses. Which were then greately nerfed after a while. Rockstar began to push their shark cards harder and began to fight the competition they themselves made. That was the first time I noticed Rockstar being greedy and cutting players' income to make it harder for them to grind the money in game making them feel like they need to invest real $$ to get some in-game $$.After that CEO import\export with crates and stolen vehicles came out which, again, at first allowed players to earn some nice money pretty fast. And guess what happened next? Rockstar nerfed the income yet again making it hardly profitable for the players. And at the same time the prices kept growing wild. Like some cars costing over $2'000'000, apartments costing over 1 milion providing no extra features. Hardly useful mobile operation centers costing 1.5-2 million. And shark cards popping up everywhere like a real annoying advertisement in real life.Then in June 2017 Gunrunning came out which was a blast in moneymaking compared to any previous activities and remained the best way to make money in GTA Online for a while. At last I was able to keep up with crazy prices on cars, bikes, guns, and all sorts of customization in game (still taking up insane amount of time to grind though, but at least ""the price was right"")That remained the case up untill late february \ early march of 2018, when I noticed my sales shrank in half. And this time, since it happened recently, I am able to state some real numbers:For a year I was able to pay $75'000 to get a full stock of supplies for my bunker. Which then produced me an amout of guns worth of $420'000 per one sale using a single vehicle. Meaning I had a net profit of $345'000 per one single sale playing solo. And as of today the numbers shrank down to just $210'000 per sale, but I still have to pay the same $75'000 for the supplies and wait for the same amount of time for these weapons to manufacture which makes my net profit $135'000 (down from $345'000). That's $210'000 less than it used to be PER ONE SALE.The exact same thing happened to EVERY DLC activities earlier. I just can't memorize the exact diffirence in numbers for those older changes, but the effect was the same every time. I stopped doing these older missions since they became hardly profitable. And this time the gunrunning is gonna be my next abandoned facility :(Now let's move on to another huge problem of this game: CHEATERS.Rockstar made only one good attempt in fighting modders for real. JUST ONCE. When they decided to completely prohibit the use of any modification for GTA Online, which then resulted in a huge outbreak of negative reviews on Steam which spooked Rockstar to the bone. And they quickly reverted these changes completely removing such protection within a couple days. Allowing rеtаrdеd individuals to keep on griefing on other players using mods.And nothing has changed ever since.This is why I AM NOT GOING TO BUY and DO NOT RECOMEND you to buy ANY GAMES FROM ROCKSTAR in the future.Rockstar used to be a great company making masterpiece games. But they became corrupted by these filthy greedy marketologists, and began to penalize their loyal and honest players with income cuts, crazy in-game prices and long grind times while allowing cheaters and modders to thrive on, completely ruining GTA Online.ROCKSTAR, STOP BEING GREEDY AND MAKE YOUR GAME GREAT AGAIN!"

You're getting what you pay for there.If on the other hand you're looking to play GTA Online I cannot recommend the game anymore. It's fun in theory but the way Rockstar handles stuff is just awful. Not only are they completely helpless with the cheater situation in the game but their attempts to stop them actually hit legit players as well. I've earned quite a good amount of in game cash during one of their double money weeks shortly before the last major DLC hit and Rockstar in an attempt to remove cheated/modded money removed 7 million (thats the equivalent of about 80 real life bucks) from my account. In-game money I had earned through their event. I've contacted the support multiple times only to receive responses that either claimed the money was cheated or threatened to ban me.After about 5 support tickets I gave up. Rockstar Games is scamming their own customers, and that's why I can't recommend being a customer of Rockstar Games anymore. If you already have the game and still play GTA Online I'd recommend doing the following: Go online and search for a cheater willing to give you modded money, proceed to get as much modded money as possible and spend as much of it as you can. Never even think about playing the game legitimately to earn money and for god's sake don't buy shark cards.Cheers."
84,"1,231.6",Not Recommended," September 28, 2017",815,"Until the last update, I would have highly recommended this game, but sadly I would advise everyone to steer away from this game and any other future Take-Two/Rockstar game. I think theifs is the best way to describe these companies. I can confirm to those of you reading these reviews saying ""surely they wouldn't be removing in game funds that people pay $80/£60+ for?"" that it is really happening. I will split this review into two parts; Single Player and Multiplayer.SingleplayerThe story and how it plays out for single player is possibly the best out there. The story is fantasic, and there are very few missions that aren't fun to play. Also, the implementation of an in-game stock market (although not the best thing ever) is really cool to me. Pairing this with missions that allow you to manipulate this stock market, you can earn millions, even billions. But this leads to the issue of there being nothing to spend it on. Singleplayer mode for some reason does not get content from Rockstar's updates. The only way you can access them is by grinding multiplayer for days to afford the likes of one car, however we will get to that.Overall, Singleplayer is absolutely fantastic, except from the fact that after the story there is little to do unless you are interested in mods, in which case you will probably love this game for that.Oh yay, this train wreck. Okay, so I have 1,151 hours on Steam for GTA V, with around 1,000 being for multiplayer. I converted my stats from PS3 so likely have around double that. I know what I am talking about with this game. The multiplayer in this game is absolutely trash now. I was always able to look past the grind in this game, but it has gotten to the point now where money is so hard to make, and things are so expensive that it is no longer fun. At all. Rockstar and Take-Two have become money ♥♥♥♥♥s, so much so that they are taking purchased in-funds away for NO REASON and will accuse you of hacking the game. If you refuse to purchase the in-game currency (like me), then you will have to grind. Now, at least in my ways, around 1 hour of in game grinding will bring in, at most, around $300,000, and that's if youre grinding really hard, non stop, and have the most lucrative in game businesses in the game. When starting out, you will be lucky to bring in $100,000 per hour, so as you can see, it's a pretty tough grind anyway. The last update called ""Smuggler's Run"" brought some of the most expensive content in GTA Online to date, with things costing $1,500,000 upwards. I had 2.6 million removed from an in-game challenge called Criminal Mastermind that took me months to complete, getting $10,000,000 from. This was removed because it was ""modded or cheated money"". So, 6 tickets to Rockstar later, I have quite rudely been told by a robot to go ♥♥♥♥ myself and that I'm not getting it back, and that's why I've finally decided that enough is enough with this game.Something that I have always found interesting in GTA Online is that you can buy a yacht - a real calling card, with the most expensive one sitting at $10,000,000. The highest in-game currency you can purchase is $8,000,000, sitting at $100 real money. That to me has always seemed ridiculous for what is already a fairly expensive game.Also, if you want to mod singleplayer, thats fine in their eyes (not really since they shut down OpenIV, a company they supported but hey let's let bygones be bygones), but if you DARE go near their money making method and try to make things fun, you will be banned and stripped of everything you have online.This review could go on forever, about a game/company that steals from their fans and shuts down companies who they once directed their fans to, but I think it's time to sum it up. For what was for a very long time my favourite game ever, I would highly recommend that you never go near this game, even if you recieve it for free. I will never touch another Rockstar or Take-Two game, and hope that their next game flops and they learn no treat their fans better, however, if you're not giving them money, they hope you ♥♥♥♥ yourself.Update: Went on today to see if I had been refunded yet, and guess what!! I haven't.Update 2: Left another ticket to Rockstar asking HOW my money was illegitamate, stating several times that I know that it, according to them, is illegitimate but after my ticket making it to support stage 3 (presumably the highest? Has been in all support companies I know.), guess what happened? I got the same copied and pasted god damn response AGAIN. This reponse took them over a week to type."

We did some CEO missions and drove around, deciding not to bother the other players and do our own thing. I log off the game. Five minutes later i receive an email stating i have violated the EULA and my account, character, and inventory have all been reset. Years of work. Gone. I decided to give the game another chance after the same scenario had happened to my best friend before the reset was a thing, just to have it happen to me. Don't get me wrong, we had a blast driving around, grinding up enough money to finally buy the vehicles and homes we wanted, then proceed to try the new modes as they came out like the racing, CEO, adversary modes. I saw all these negative reviews on the page stating how people had been randomly banned, and when they brought this up on the forums, they were called ""liars"" and told ""Dont cheat again♥♥♥♥♥quot;. I thought they were full of♥♥♥♥♥♥until it happened to me. I have no chance of getting all i've worked for back unless i buy their damn shark cards, and even then, whos to say they wont ban me again? I can say the uninstall button worked better than the anti-cheat, as ive seen countless modders roaming around unopposed, causing hell to other players.

Also, almost everyone you meet online is just looking for a fight and/or a way to annoy you to no end.It's also excessively grindy. You don't unlock all weapons, clothing and cosmetics until lvl 100 and you're very limited when you first start.

69,460.6,Not Recommended," December 12, 2017",2,"Singleplayer is amazing. The story, characters, map. Even after playing over and over again it's still entertaining. I like it way more than the GTA 4's story.As for online - this is the reason why I don't recommend the game, because I think that most people nowadays buy the game mainly because of the online. Don't get me wrong; I used to love it, played over 400 hours of pure online, everything was awesome, I thought that this is the perfect multiplayer game, they are constantly updating it and there is a lot of stuff - which has become the problem. A year and a half ago, everything was more or less balanced, the prices were reasonable. After the Import/Export things were getting drastically different. Looked like this to me:""Hey buddy, want to enjoy the content? Well, you should get our brand new garage only for 2M.""Then Gunrunning. Again, my overall feelings:""Look at this cool update! The players will be able to get their bunkers only for 1.5M. Also, don't forget to upgrade your equipment for another 1M. Did we forget to mention that getting additional people working for you will only cost you half a million? By the way, you will time from time get raided and lose everything, unless you buy another cameras for 400K! All the raids will magically disappear! Want to modify your weapons in your Workshop? Well, too bad, you need a trailer for that, but don't worry, it's only 1 to 2 and a half millions. Do you want to train your shooting? There you go, only for 700K! Do you prefer white over black? The paint costs 105K, so... Did we mention that you can take a nap there? The key for that room costs 265K. Do you want a Gun Locker which you will probably never use? That will be 175K. You want some caddies? 85K or 120K if you want to have them larger. Don't forget to check out the new cars! Get yourself a car that shoots a couple of missiles only for 4-5M!""How I felt about Smuggler's Run:The prices of the content added were skyrocketing, if you wanted to truly enjoy the game, you had to either make money all day long if you wanted to be a fair dude that doesn't hack, which is by the way, another big problem with this game, or buy some cards that are horribly overpriced. At this point I didn't have time to play all day long, I didn't want to hack and I totally didn't want to spend twice the price of the game on some cards, so I stopped playing. Since then, I've been ignoring the game, not watching any videos and not paying attention to the updates. Sometimes, when I notice that there's an update, I come back for a couple of minutes and look how a vehicle with a couple of missiles costs over 4 millions. Now another heist update, you might think this:The reality, however, looks like this:And as a person who doesn't have that much time to play anymore, I can't enjoy the content anymore. Another problem with this game are the hackers. I finally am thrown into a lobby after 10 minutes of loading, I see that I am immediately teleported to an airport from my house with a couple of other people and I am stuck doing some rather strange animations. I always report the guy when I find out who it is, but it doesn't seem to help. I've heard some heartbreaking stories of people getting banned for no reason, this luckily hasn't happened to me yet."

65,667.7,Not Recommended," June 15, 2017",98,"This is a pretty long review, be warnedWould like to start out my review by saying I've played 358 hours of this game. I think I have a good idea of what it's like.I'd also like to list my PC specs now and what they were when I originally bought the game.CPU: Core i7 7700K (Was Core i7 6700K)GPU: MSI GTX 1070 (8GB) (Was EVGA GTX 960 (2GB))RAM: 8GB, Dual-channel DDR4 @2400MHz (Was 8GB, Dual-channel DDR4 @2133MHz)I play the game at 1080p with 'Very High' settings. (Was High-Very high settings)Singleplayer & ModsI bought this game a while back. Enjoyed the singleplayer until I finished it. Once the story was finished, the endgame was boring with nothing left to do but install mods. As of recently, Take-Two Interactive ordered a Cease and Desist for the popular modding tool OpenIV, essentially gutting the GTA modding scene. This is unfortunate because without mods the singleplayer endgame is pretty boring.OnlineGTA Online is arguably the biggest selling point of GTA V. I'd like to say I enjoy it but I don't. Everything in GTA Online is purposefully tedious for the sake of making microtransactions viable it seems. Servers are either mostly empty or full of script kiddies. On the off-chance you do get into a mostly full server, you'd better be prepared to be killed repeatedly by players who spent hundreds of dollars in real money to buy all the best weapons and vehicles. I don't have a problem with microtransactions when they're done right but I don't feel they were done right here.I feel GTA Online is a huge victim of power creep & spectacle creep.Personally I think this game looks great. I did get tired of looking at it after maybe 100 hours and installed an ENB mod. The sounds are a bit on the weak side for me. I don't know why exactly but the guns just sound dinky and weak to me. The ENB mod I installed fixed this though by replacing the sounds with (IMO) better ones. The game performs well usually with my setup (See top of review). At least 60 FPS in most cases. There has always been a sort of stuttering issue I've had with the game. After visiting many reddit and forum posts I couldn't find a solution to the problem though this issue doesn't seem to happen to everybody.I liked GTA V's story mode. Given that I was a Nintendo child, that doesn't say much. I don't have much else to say about the story. I think most people just bought GTA V for the Online anyway.GTA V is still entertaining with some mods but with the Cease and Desist for OpenIV mods may not be an option anymore. The Online experience has been mostly negative and without mods the singleplayer experience gets boring after a while. Overall I don't think I would recommend GTA V.I'd like to clarify that I do enjoy the singleplayer campaign. It can make for quite an entertaining and even sometimes immersive experience though without mods it does lose a bit of playability towards the endgame, like I mentioned. Personally I won't stop playing the game just because mods are gone but it is still a concern to me. That is all."

164,"4,871.3",Not Recommended," September 3, 2017",1,"GTA Online, the jack of all trades game which does everything quite well while staying a safe distance away from all forms of perfection. I currently have 4,617 hours of playtime logged in this game, most of it online or in the creator. Once this game made it out on PC, complete with a first person viewpoint, I felt as though my lifelong journey of discovering an entire world which I could live in and do whatever I desired was finally becoming a reality.I loved this game. LOVED this game. I've been playing since the top-down days of GTA 1, always dreaming of the time when I could experience this crazy alternate world 'from my own eyes.'However, having spent this much time in the game leaves me with one conclusion: I simply cannot recommend this game. Not to anyone, not for any reason. Not ever.See, in a game which revolves around drugs, money, murder, and any manner of illegal activities, I kind of expect to be treated like a criminal inside of the game.I do not expect to be treated like a crimial outside of the game by the sorry excuse they have for tech support.On 08/29/17, well into week 3 of some amazing double payout bonuses and mere days away from the Smuggler's Run DLC, my few friends and I were spending many long hours playing away and racking up some serious money through all of our hard work. However, Rockstar decided that it was time to run another sweep looking for people who mod, glitch, cheat, hack, or exploit their game.Apparently it found very few of these people. Instead, it found a whole bunch of us legitimate players. Then it decided to punish us all wholesale, never once telling us why or how it came to this conclusion. Better still, many of these people with modded money didn't get affected at all!First we are met with a screen during the game's loading cycle stating 'we have determined that GTA$ and/or RP details on your account were adjusted by something out of your control and we have taken action to fix it. No additional action is required from you at this time.'Now, a lot of people will try to argue that they are completely legit 'except for that one time when...' I am not one of these people. I know what the public sessions are like in this game. It's because of this that I had only ever played in closed or solo sessions until very recently, with the same one or two known and trusted friends, for most of my online time. I had never played online on a console and had never transferred an online character. I routinely took screenshots of my online bank account just in case some modder somehow managed to get through to me and mess with my hard-earned cash.To this day I have yet to see a single glitched or modded GTA dollar go into my account. I would know if it went there. I do not place myself into situations where such a thing could happen and I keep a very close eye on what happens to my game. In addition I've never modded nor glitched GTA money, myself. I've never even duped a car. Honestly, I don't even know how to do any of this stuff!Rockstar apparently could not care any less about this as they had decided to 'take action' and steal $28,553,333 of my legitimate, hard-earned money. Right out of the blue, no explanation given. 'Okay,' I think, 'their anti-cheat is confused with the double payouts we've gotten over these last few weeks. They'll figure it out, this'll get sorted out, everyone who had their legit cash removed will get it back.' There's quite a lot of us, too. Look around the forums and message boards. Tons of us. Including about ten people whom I've just stared playing with mere days ago, which happens to be most of the people that I know in this game.Sadly, this does not appear to be the case. Rockstar's support number has a doofy automated thing saying to use their support website (which many of us have already attempted to use.) Any attempt to mention this stolen money on said website will soon see the issue being flagged as being a 'cheat/exploit or banning issue.' It may or may not also have an automated response from some soulless bot stating that ""Your shared bank account in GTA Online was adjusted to remove illegitimately gained in-game money."" Then the trouble ticket will be closed. End of story, slap across the face. 'You cheated, we corrected it, get lost.'Like Hell! Not ONCE have I EVER done anything in this game to cheat. I HATE cheating. Had any modded money been dropped onto me I would have told them about it in a heartbeat. But Rockstar simply does not care about how legitimate we are. They are always in the right, we as players are always in the wrong. I'll probably never see that money back but that doesn't mean I'm going to stop sending them trouble tickets about it. I'm currently sitting at number four. They will keep hearing from me until they either fix their error or ban me.Nowhere has there been any official word from them about this. No 'we recognize that there was an issue' or 'we are currently looking into the matter.' Nope, we're all dirty cheaters, go screw off somewhere else. As if it wasn't bad enough that they find any way they can to deplete our online bank accounts through normal play, now they're outright stealing it from a lot of us!All of the other rampant bugs in this game, both new and old, I could come to overlook (and there are quite a few of them!) The increasingly forced public session play, the psychotic AI drivers, the ridiculous AI buffs, being called a '♥♥♥♥♥ucker' by the NPC's hundreds of times during play (Rockstar must have a fascination with this word combination,) the list goes on. I won't even get into the mess that is story mode.This matter, however... Now that I know who I am dealing with I am done purchasing anything with Rockstar's name on it. Take 2 is in significant danger as well since their name is now associated with this title. This kind of treatment of their playerbase is beyond unacceptable. I can't even fathom how much of my time had been lost due to this, though if you consider that their most expensive Shark Card weighs in at $100 USD and gives you 8 million credits then they just stole nearly $357 USD from me because of this nonsense and there isn't anything in the world I can do about it. (Except for sending them a bunch of trouble tickets and writing a negative review on Steam. Power to the consumer, gorramit.)I had worked my butt off in this game for every dollar which I had saved and spent. I played it smart, made intelligent purchases, played the game the way it was meant to be played and did everything that I could do to protect myself and my belongings. As it turns out someone did manage to mess up my account in the end, just not how I would have expected.Grand Theft Auto receives two middle fingers way, way up. If you've managed to avoid purchasing this game so far, congratulations! Stay far, far away from it and its rampant toxicity. If you already have purchased this and happened to experience a similar situation then I strongly encourage you all to join me in avoiding any of their games from this point forward while continuing to contact them through any means possible until they fix their broken crap and give us back our hard-earned money.Seriously, go sit on a cactus Rockstar."
41,"1,141.0",Not Recommended," May 26, 2017",176,"This game...I've played it a ton, and I've had fun, I've met nice people as well.This would be an absolute favorite if only it wasn't for the community. It seems like every session has those pesky hackers/modders or whatever and nearly everyone in freeroam is just hostile for no apparent reason. I'm fine with fights in the game as long as it's for a valid reason, but I just can't understand people who shoot everything they see.Getting money in online is a problem as well, it's just grindy. You know, unless some modder decides to drop everyone money which has a chance to ban people anyway. About the bans as well, I haven't experienced it myself, but I've heard that a lot of people are getting banned for no reason at all, and Rockstar won't even give them a reason for it. Their support won't even help with removing a ban because their system is just great and never makes mistakes and whatnot. Yeah, right.Then what's actually good about the game. Well, for starters, the graphics are amazing and the storyline is quite enjoyable. The game also has a wide selection of vehicles, including a ton of cars and customization for them, helicopters, boats, planes and some military vehicles like tanks and jet fighters, which we'll probably be getting more of in an upcoming DLC (the DLC itself is free to download). You can also buy a yacht in online for the low-low price of 6 million dollars and up, but it can't be controlled other than paying to move it to a preset location.Overall I like the game. I've played it for hundreds of hours, which should prove that I've enjoyed playing it. The only real flaw is, yet again, the community. I just can't bring myself to give the game a positive rating with the modder situation, there are so many of them, and they'll never completely disappear but at the moment the situation is very bad. I'll probably keep playing though, so don't be too surprised if you see that I've played it lately.Edit:Apparently Take Two has now made modding illegal. On the good side of things, people probably won't be getting teleported into the ocean or blown up by some random force. But this also means that the only way to get money is to just grind.Every heist finale on hard is just over three million dollars in total, which is just barely enough to get a Hydra, a VTOL capable jet fighter. There are multiple vehicles which are even more expensive than the Hydra. Well, it would be enough if it was actually possible to get 100% cuts for heists, but the maximum cut for one person is 70%.The yachts I mentioned previously can cost upwards of $10 million with the most expensive things. That's just one ""vehicle"" out of the hundreds that the game has to offer, and with the newest update there's just more expensive stuff that requires more grinding to get.In conclusion, the game is now a big grindfest and the only way to help the situation (that I can think of) is making the payouts larger. Seriously, the final heist which requires a lot of setting up and the finale is very hard when you're playing with randoms, you'll probably get 300k for doing the whole heist. 300k is pretty much nothing, buying everything in the new DLC would cost upwards of $30 million.Another edit:Rockstar's customer support is unbelievably crap.They've just removed the money I've earned legitimately and will not even read the ticket I sent them. Instead they've just sent another automated reply and immediately closed the ticket.Other people have gotten the exact same response which I got as well, I think that proves it's an automated system just fine.Another thing, the support site keeps throwing errors at me even though the tickets are apparently going through. Fix your stuff, Rockstar.Edit #3:I just got an email from Rockstar saying that my account was ""used in violation of our Terms of Service and/or EULA"" and that my account was completely wiped and suspended for 30 days. Remember what I said about their anti-cheat? Yeah. It's obviously working as intended.Another ban wave seems to be going on which is why I was banned as well. I got shortly unbanned and my character is now back to normal. From what I've seen, Rockstar's anti-cheat is flagging everyone who plays in online as modders which is why a lot of people are getting banned.tl;dr: The online part of the game is a big grindfest, we need to get more money for doing stuff, their customer support sucks and people get banned without any reason given for it."

This was the final culmination in the online section of the game, which has been for a while a micro-transaction hell-hole of hackers, cheaters, and people with wallets so big they can afford the £100+ needed to buy everything you could possibly want in a game you bought for £60. The micro-transactions have now made the online near enough unplayable. If you want to win races, you need a car that can only really be gained by purchasing in game currency. If not, you have a very, very long and repetitive grind ahead. It's ridiculous. If paying £60 for the game three times.... Xbox 360 and One, and for PC, isn't giving the company enough money, they ask for £50 every time you might fancy having a new appartment... Or clubhouse, office or warehouse for the latest DLC packages which are now clearly for nothing other than financial gain. I can not recommend buying the game if you want to play single-player as a modded version, and only play the online mode if you are either a:stupidly wealthy, or b: lacking in anything else to do other than vegetate over a grind for not enough money to progress."

I have had alot of good times either racing friends or wacking some random pedestrian with a baseball bat.But, as you may have heard (and if you havent heard you must have been living under a rock because jesus the steam reviews have lit up like a christmas tree). Take Two Interactive, the parent company for rockstar games, has sent a cease and desist to a certain mod called OpenIV. This mod is the backbone of at least half the mods for GTAV, essentially meaning TakeTwo has killed modding in one fell swoop.So, let me ask this Take Two Interactive. Was it not enough to sell three different versions of your game? Was it not enough to shove shark cards down our throat by making online an unbearable grind to the top? Was it not enough to release almost no content for single player forcing modders to take action? Was it not enough to have your game be best selling in steam almost. Every.

I bought GTA5 for PS3 as soon as it came out, I waited for you to launch multiplayer, I waited for you to fix multiplayer and I've watched the multiplayer become a money grabbing scheme full of micro transactions that make you spend ludicrous amounts of money just to get somewhere in the game. (8,000,000 won't even buy you 2% of the multiplayer content, and that's a $100 of actual money). I have never bought a single shark card from you and I never plan to. I've spent hundreds of hours on your game. I've even put up with you canceling single player dlcs and even firing the man, the legend, Leslie Benzies. But now you have taken it way too far. The ONLY reason I bought your game for the PC was so that I could mod it. I wanted to add some more depth to the single player part of GTA5. I could care less about modding online, I just wanted to get some visual graphical improvements and create single player skits using the Rockstar Editor (which you already f*cked up with your limited range camera...). But now since Take Two has made Open IV (a modding tool that was used for 10 years) illegal just so that you can try and get the few remaining people that enjoy single player with mods to try to switch to your sh*tty multiplayer so you can earn some more money. I have never seen a company more greedy for money. If I could refund this game and the countless hours of my life that I spent on this game I would do so in a heartbeat"

90,396.2,Not Recommended," August 30, 2016",1,"Let me start at the beginning in order to accurately describe this atrocity that has happened to me a few months ago. Just now decided to write a review after seeing the same thing has happened to so many others.I bought GTAV on September 17th, 2013. I waited in the pre-order line at gamestop because I was so damn hyped for this game. I was only intending to play it on console until the PC version came out. At this point I had no clue that there was going to be character swaps from console to PC. I obtain level 72 on console. Loving the game, couldn't be happier (except if the radio stations were better).PC version release date is announced sometime in January 2015. I immediately pre-order it in order to get the bonus money that was available as a pre-order incentive. Upon release I transfer my character from console to PC and recieve my pre-order money. I was so thrilled to finally be playing this great game on PC. In the last year I put in 390 hours online in this game and achieved level 136 if I recall correctly. Countless hours of heist grinding, job grinding, lots of shark cards bought. Sitting at something like 11million dollars. 2 houses, 2 garages. Everything I could ever want in the game. I had things that weren't even obtainable anymore. I was thrilled with where the game was going. Then.... I get bored; So I quit playing for 2 months.A friend asks me, ""Hey come play GTA with me let's wreck some kids"". Sure why not. I get on for about an hour and we do just that, wreck some kids. I log off for the night and log in the next day to a 10 day ban. I was beyond baffled. How could I be banned when I didn't do anything? Surely rockstar support can help me. So I call in an attempt to figure out what is going on. I get fed a rehearsed line about bans being the result of online modding etc etc. I ask for a supervisor, the supervisor says the same thing. I ask for his supervisor. He says there is no one above him available and I was unable to appeal my ban. His reasons are as follows.He neglects to tell me that the system was going to take all of my money and I would have to start over. Grinding countless heists/jobs or buy a large sum shark card (which is ultimately what they wanted me to do).I come back around 12 days later and play for a few hours. Nothing out of the ordinary happens. I then got off for the night. The following day I got back on and was banned again. This time for 30 days. I think to myself ""No &*%#ing way, this isn't possible"". I call and get the same rehearsed line from both the first and second level of support (always ask for a supervisor). Except this time something was different. This time I was being allowed to appeal my ban. I thought for sure I would be exonerated of these allegations. I was told that I must have been hacking if their skynet system banned me. That there is nothing they can do and that ""evidence of illicit activity"" was found on my account. So I ask them to check again and they do. Same result.At this point I start thinking ahead. ""What happens when I get back from this 30 day ban?"". ""I'm just going to be banned again for the same false reason?""They reply, ""that shouldn't happen sir"". I reply, ""Shoulda coulda woulda. It's happened twice now so what makes next time any different. No variables have changed. If I record all of my gameplay from now on will that protect me? If I am indeed banned upon return to your game can I use the footage as proof of my innocence?""""Yes"", I was told. Not maybe, not ""we're not sure"". I was toldSo I did just that. I recorded all of my gameplay. Unfortunately ""all"" only ended up being roughly 2 hours the night I was unbanned after the 30 day ban because I was immediately banned permanently after logging off for that night.This is starting to get a little longer than I expected so I'll cut it short. I tried to appeal the permament ban. I thought ""I have video that I didn't do anything, surely this time it will be different.... they will have to unban me"".I'll just end my review here and link my evidence. The videos of my gameplay and their final reply to me in my appeal where I linked them the videos.Edit: According to various sources (denied by Rockstar when I called them today) I was banned for MSI Afterburner/RivaTuner. This would make sense to me now that I think about it. However my review remains unchanged because they are doing absolutely nothing to fix the issue. I was told that I am not allowed to appeal my permanent ban because their system is flawless and does not falsely ban people for any reason. The support supervisor (Kyle) even acknowledged that he had heard of the MSI/Riva complaint but that it was ""false"". So yeah I'm still in the same place I started. Still will never support another Rockstar game for as long as I live."

If you value your time and sanity, make sure to skip this gameComing from a last gen console I had legitimatley earned $5million (Heists, missions, sharkcards). I moved to PC to play the new content and get new updates, and along with it I got a $1.25million Sharkcard. I spend some money here and there, and ultimatly I'm left at $3million and I decided to get back on the grind.One day I join a random lobby after finishing a mission, and the lobby happened to have a hacker who was giving away money, and put $30million into my account. Couldn't do anything about it. I contacted Rockstar Support about this and they basically said ""whatever, just keep it"". I didnt spend much from it, and put it into my second character so I could go back to trying to be legit.A couple of updates later, Rockstar removes all of my money. That includes my Sharkcard and my legitmatly earned money. I contacted Rockstar Support again and they said that they found all the money in my account to be fraudulent and removed it all. I tried pursuing it further to get my $20 sharkcard back at least but I was threatened with being banned for ""false reports"".Okay, so whatever I'll just sell some cars I don't use, and use the businesses I have to make money again. Come around to the new Smugglers Update, and I have $2million legit from my businesses, ready for whatever boat-motorcycle-plane they have for this update. Keep in mind that I was grinding this money for a good while now and spent a lot of time working for it having to deal with public lobby bs and griefers.I update the game, and what do you know - Rockstar removed my money again for being ""illegitimatley earned"".Now I'm again at $0, with Rockstar Support being Rockstar Bot Support, I have not gotten any responses or any sight of help. In total I spent about $150 on the game (from console and PC with Shakrcards) just to be treated like scum of the earth. I'm done playing the game.

145,"1,740.1",Not Recommended," November 9, 2017",1,"The CEO of Take 2, GTA's publisher talking about how he will force microtransactions into every single one of their games, they want more the $60+ that we all pay for the game but hundreds over the course of your play time regardless of the game.Educate yourself, read how bad these people are know your enemy as a gamer, as a consumer, is: https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/309190/TakeTwo_plans_to_only_release_games_with_recurrent_consumer_spending_hooks.phpSingle player, still good, as with most if not all GTA titles thus far, playing 3 different characters is both at times tiring and fun. One of the 3 is the least interesting, that being Franklin, his character was the least fleshed out yet was made out to be the glue to the group. The gameplay is mostly better and for it's time it looked great though not visually not as impressive, there are however still instances where the world lives and you just sit back and watch.By now you already know what the story is about, you do heists, which compared to PD2, are quite well done and make you feel like you're actually getting something out of it after you've planned for several set-up missions. Your characters level up their traits so the now bog standard RPG elements are built into the game, for better or for worse which means at times a lot of grinding in order to get better which again is forced and boring in any game. All in all the story is worth it so long as you find the game on sale, NEVER pay full price for this title as it is simply not worth $60 for a 4 year old game, period.Now the online aspect of GTA5, where to start.... well it WAS a fair sandbox where you could enjoy getting killed by random a-holes in the server but now you can get that same feeling while you're flying, riding in a tank, anywhere you go you will be harried by other players in Freeroam. It was a horrible design choice and I will never understand what they ultimately thought would happen. That's just the crappy overworld, joining matches is a chore if you can even find anything then have fun with the infinite number of game modes that Rockstar keeps shoving out of the door to keep people playing because you'll never find a game mode beyond it's initial introduction. By the way that’s if you aren’t killed by the countless modders that have been a problem since day 1 of the PC release but does Rockstar do anything? No they go after the victims rather then the offenders.On the subject of stability or how good of a port GTA5 is over all, it is pretty good but it also isn't, the load times are insane, even having the game on an SSD it can take at times an unlimited amount of time to load/connect to an offline lobby. While the game runs fairly well Rockstar clearly did not make sure that stability and reliability was mirrored during loading and connecting to a lobby. Sorry but a 4 year old game if it's well optimized should not take 5+ minutes to load on an SSD or any hard drive for that matter, period.How they treat their paying customers and loyal player base is also shameful, their support staff, if you can call them that, do nothing but read from prefabricated responses and treats you like you caused the issue to happen. They constantly suggest over the top things to fix completely separate issues, like uninstall our 50+ gigabyte game and reinstall it in order to fix a connection problem. Not to mention the countless false positives for account bans and account wipes, which means that even a straight as an arrow player can and will get banned or have all of their cash wiped entirely from their character just because their “state of the art trusted anti-cheat” system flagged your account. They constantly blame the victim rather then the cause and their support staff are instructed not to speak to anyone regarding bans or said money wipes. They have constantly denied any and all wrong doing on every account even when given mountains of evidence they are staunch in their “belief” that you are the problem and not their system.Making money, which is the only way to really get anywhere in the game, because it's not like I want to play the game that I bought, no I want to literally work for hours at a time grinding missions, heists, game modes, etc. Just to get anywhere in the game. If you don't grind for cash or pay for in game money you will suffer, the poor are indeed the lesser class in GTA Online with no real way to gain serious money if they can't find the means or the tools. You can't get the tools if you don’t have the money and if you don’t have the tools you can't make the money. It's a horrible circle and it does not make a fun game to just enjoy, because you can't because it's work, you're quite literally working within the game universe. If you own a business, you're doing work, if you're trying to make money via heists (which is no longer the best way to make money these days, anymore anyway) you work and grind for DAYS on end. With the amount of time that I spent working in GTA Online, comparing their own pricing for Shark Cards I would have spent thousands of dollars to give you some perspective and I still don't own everything, not even close. Everything in Online is now priced so that it all but forces you to buy Shark Cards which Rockstar's fee to pay microtransactions. The best part about them now is that they are totally worthless, with each update that Rockstar releases the items get more and more expensive to the point where even the $100 Shark Card for $8 million, won't even buy you a car or two, where as before when the game was first out you'd be hard pressed to spend all $8 million. It is done on purpose and now that Take 2's CEO has consistently come out to the public and investor meetings and stated that he treats customers by how they spend on his games. That should tell you what kind of horrible person and horrible company Take 2 and Rockstar have turned into.Their CEO is on record comparing paying human customers to minnows, dolphins and whales, these dehumanizing categories put gamers into their spending habits, if you spend very little and simply grind for days on end for your cash well you’re a minnow, if you buy money constantly then you’re a whale. These are the people running Take 2 and Rockstar, these are the people saying making games is too expensive, the “people” who compare human beings to aquatic creatures based on their spending habits.Do yourself and your fellow gamers some respect and avoid this title, educate yourself on how badly Take 2 and Rockstar have been treating their own paying customers for the past 4 years and realize that it will NEVER go back to the way it was. Take 2 and Rockstar will never be the same again, and when this microtransaction bubble bursts, because it will, Take 2 and Rockstar will be gone because they've now made sure that if their ideas fail their companies fail. It's better to please your investors then your actual customers, the ones who make your fame possible. Spend your money on another more deserving company, please."

148,156.2,Not Recommended," November 17, 2017",175,"I hate to have to give this game a negative. I really do, flat out makes me tired of it having to do so. It's a fun game, great map, wonderful level of detail, amazing amount of things to do. The single player story is awesome and if you plan on buying it for the single player I would recommend it. Played it during the PS3-era and really enjoyed it. Even online at the time it was fun.But on to headache of why I have to give this a negative. Shark-Cards. Paying real money to get yourself in-game currency. I think it's trashed this game significantly. I get it, yea Rockstar you somehow need to make money to keep this game active and for the free DLC you've been providing thats available for all players.First off. The price of these Shark-Cards and how much you get out of them. $100 for 8 million. Come on. Really? That buys you 2-3 top-tier vehicles tops because you have everything inflated in the market making it practically a grind nightmare. Hell, the Megalagon gets you halfway to a Yacht that's priced at 16 million. Literally, $200 worth of Shark-Cards for a single Yacht that you can't even drive around. From what I hear the things practically pointless and all you can do on it is change your clothes and sleep. Like if Rockstar did this the standard way and sold their DLC it would literally be priced at a couple or even several hundred dollars in their world. Or hell, $200 for a single thing that serves you literally no purpose. And I’m scared to even look up how amount of in-game currency I have to even get in order to buy every vehicle that's released in these DLC’s. Literally a massive grind nightmare.Which leads to my 2nd point on Shark-Cards. Like, lets say I magically have the money to afford and waste on a couple thousand dollars worth of Shark-Cards (Rockstars Wet Dream). Than what? As a 90's gamer what in the hell is the point of doing anything like player missions, heists, cargo missions, etc if I already have everything provided cause I paid real cash for it. Maybe have fun doing them all once with really nice stuff, but that isn't really all that long to do and you have absolutely nothing to strive for in-game cause you already have everything...Thirdly, Rockstar will do anything to this game and at all cost to get you to buy a Shark-Card. Raise prices of new vehicles and really just about everything they add. Lower payouts on missions not to mention long cool-off times so you’re not making so much so fast.. Increase costs of practically everything and make sure that it remains high for you, and I’ll continue on that and why I mentioned it. Their whole world revolves on whatever it takes to getting you to buy a friggin Shark Card. It, just sucks frankly.Now on to the CEO work. Ugh. This system that they have going on here, just doesn’t work. Nobody in their right mind is going to be your associate or bodyguard with these payouts. Nobody. Maybe if you can trick a scrub into working for you a bit before they realize they can make more money doing their own thing. Seriously, it isn’t worth it. There's absolutely no incentive for people to work for you… but against you. Now that's when a bigger grind nightmare happens because every player in session is bound to screw you up. Like Special-Cargo for example, all it takes is one player in a fancy Hydra and its over. You’ve lost tens if not hundreds of thousands on all this cargo that didn’t make you jack in the end. Which leads to people especially us PC gamers to resource monitor the hell out of a full public session and play it absolutely alone. And that sucks too. To fill a 111 crate warehouse would take you days worth of gameplay if done alone and hell a week’s worth doing one crate at a time to give you the better profit margin. Like what is this Rockstar? A job? Its supposed to be a game. Not everybody has that amount of free time like I do sadly. But if you have $20 to spend on a Shark Card it will give you close to the amount you’d make… and that gives you really nothing that's going to help you grind. Vehicle cargo literally blows me away. Never have I felt so ripped off in a video game making on average 75k profit selling… a supercar that markets for close to 3 million. I’m sorry. What? And what you have to go through to source a car with NPC’s left, right and helicopters shooting and crashing into you to make sure the repair costs rack up.You’ll have a similar story doing VIP work. I find it so dumb. That the only thing worth doing in all that is cocaine and that accounts for a small margin of what else you can do. And their payouts literally are not worth the cost.So thankfully I saw right through those shark cards and never bought one. Infact I’m proud I never gave Rockstar that satisfaction. For the sake of GTA6 and the future of GTA Online I have to give this a negative review. This turn the Gaming Industry has taken the past few years is just depressing. It's definitely not what it used to be. But hell Rockstar may never read this or even consider a thing if they did cause it's all about profit and statistics now. Guess I’ve made my point."

However, I now have to make my review negative for the following reasons.I've had my current character for over two years. In those two years I reached level 100 and I have so much stuff like multiple properties, a yacht, a business, a biker gang, etc. Not once have I modded GTA Online, but that didn't stop them from banning me.I recently logged on to find out that my account was suspended until next month, and that when my account became available again, I would have to start over. My first thought was that this is some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. I didn't hack, I worked my way for a long time to get my character to where it was now and I lose it all because Rockstar can't tell the difference between a modder and a regular user.My second thought is that ""this is why people hack"". Rockstar makes everything in GTA Online super expensive. It's over $1mil for a damn tug boat, a really ugly tug boat. I can buy a nice super car for a quarter of that price, any car would be better that a slow♥♥♥♥♥tug boat.

But nothing to be worried about.When I started the multiplayer, everything appeared to work just fine. It looks more like a loadingscreen simulator but there is still plenty of fun to be had. The sheer amount of stuff to do is amazing and with some friends you can have hundreds of hours of fun. But then everything changed when Rockstar attacked..Now I cannot find a single game without hackers, modders or whatever the ♥♥♥♥ you call them. When I still had a low-level character, I met a few hackers and they were generally nice people. They played along in heists and missions and just did their own thing and had fun by themselves without bothering the other players.But now it seems they have turned extremely hostile. Blowing up your vehicles, dropping you from high altitudes, spawning a tsunami of cars on your head, putting people in lift cabins, going on a rampage while being invulnerable to attacks.. It's just ridiculous, unfair and extremely childish.Rockstar has failed miserably in removing these hackers from their game. They are banning more innocent players than hackers with their new automated system.Yesterday (7th of May, 2017), for example, out of the blue a hacker gave me 17 million dollars. You may think 'Allright! More money to spend! finally I can buy that Yacht and modified car I've been working my♥♥♥♥♥off to obtain!'But you'd be wrong. I IMMEDIATELY left that game so the amount I got wouldn't be rising even further.Why? Because Rockstar is now also punishing players who OBTAIN money from hackers, whether it was obtained voluntarily or not. Now I am terrified of Rockstar's ""Banning machine of Death"" and affraid to play the game again for fear that my level 112 character will be reset and all of my work will be gone without any hope of getting it back.Hackers, you're not trolls.

273,"2,456.5",Not Recommended," August 5, 2017",1,"I made the mistake of purchasing this game for PC. I waited, and was excited. I took the numerous delays that this port experienced with stride. Upon playing this game for an amount of time that has left me disgusted and embarrased, I can really only say one thing to summarize: the hacking is terrible, and the game grinding is worse.Every so often, I return to this game asking myself ""Why did I stop playing again?"" The answer comes in less than 10 minutes of playing in a public lobby, when a hacker will do any of the following: teleport me over the ocean, blow me up, blow my vehicle up but make it seem as though I blew it up (so you have to pay a premium to get it back), kill me from across the map, teleport me the the ceiling for a free fall with no parachute, take money from my in game account, spam blow me up in a constant cycle of death, sticking a firepit onto my character so that he will burn to death constantly (the firepit never goes away unless you restart the game itself), or simply crash my game entirely.Oh wait, my GOSH, they did address the hacking. No more OpenIV Liberty City for GTA V. Those dastardly spawns of Satan within OpenIV are surely more of a threat than actual in-game hackers that have ruined countless gaming experiences, right? Wait a minute here....something seems a little fishy...Perhaps Rockstar, or TakeTwo for that matter, likes in-game hackers more than OpenIV for one simple reason: OpenIV stands to cut into possible revenue for TakeTwo (why play Online where there is money to be made by Rockstar when I can play in a Liberty City mod for freeeee); while hackers take players' money, which opens up the potential for more time spent in-game to earn the money back, or the possible purchase of a Shark Card. Seems simple enough for me.On to the other bone I have to pick (oh Rockstar, why have you left so many for me to chew on?): in-game prices. ""Free DLC"" is a blantant lie. It's free if you have no life in order to play the game constantly for the medicore payouts that you get for completing ""high paying, high risk work"" that is required to pay for all of this ""free content"". However, if you have other priorities in life that exceed making bank as a major criminal in this world of photons and hacking, then your best bet of experiencing any kind of new content is to look up the myriad of videos that are posted by the deplorable YouTubers of the GTA community (you know the ones), and you will surely have your fill of this content. Or you can ask one of the numerous hackers in this game to simply spawn you some of the new content. Have I mentioned that there are hackers galore in this game, by the way?Honestly though, just look at the prices for Shark Cards, and then look at the prices for in game content. Your question as to why a flying bike that shoots homing missile was added, has been dutifully answered.This game has left me beyond disappointed in the end, and quite the sour taste in my mouth. My disgusting amount of hours in-game speak for themselves: I enjoyed it at one point, but the constant grinding for a game with little reward, hardly any payout for in-game work, the exorbitant prices for any new content, and the experience ruining hacking has left me with little desire to ever play the game again.

Online is a piece of misused, over exaggerated, deceptive cow and moose hybrid of excrement. I say this because of all the bull.First, CEO MC and the new gunrunning mission can't even be done without jet grievers and boys without a male reproductive system blowing up your 25 mph truck your forced to drive to deliver whatever type of cargo.Second, the complete despicable scams of shark cards. No joke Rockstar has begged us to by their sharkcards to the point they probably would give us a BJ for them. The shark cards ruined GTA online as a whole. Honestly these shark cards can go gobble on a turkey's balls.Thirdly everything is to expensive for the amount of money you make. GTA has basically become Clash of Clans with the amount of grinding you have to do for the amount of money you get which is smaller than Kim Jong Un's special member.Now onto the modding spectrumI can estimate at least 800+ hours of my 1,218 hours playing have been on modding.I bought the PC version just to mod and I'm sure most of the other people have to. Then Take Two Interactive wants to shave everyone's pubes all the sudden by making modding ILLEGAL.At least don't make it down right illegal cause we all know it ain't you inbred, pubescent, dilapidated, rehabilitated, lust for money more than Eve lusted for the apple, selfish company.I already have been♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥at Rockstar for the longest time with the sharkcards and overpricing of things then they do THIS? People at openIV spent so much time working on their software to make OUR experience as a community better and Rockstar nor Take Two have no consideration for us?It just appals me to see that as soon as a company gets enough power and trust by the faithful and loyal gamers, they think they can do anything to squeeze a little more money out of the cow's nipple but no. DO NOT let these communist pigs win. Boycott GTA Online or if you still want to play it DO NOT and I repeat DO NOT buy anything. It might be hard to buy nothing but you must so we can show Rockstar that just because we aren't rich people, that doesn't make us peasants with no power.So do you stand with me, the modding community, and GTA as a whole, or are you gonna be a fat communist pig and join Rockstar's and Take Two's giant circle jerk???? Cause I know I ain't Ima show Rockstar how to really jerk after I slap them with my two scents"

It's good. Statistically my favourite game. GTA Online is a Pay-To-Win-Cheater-Fest 4000 with flow-breakingly long loading into heists everytime there's a load screen, which is all the time, but single player is a lot of fun plus it has all the replayability that all the other GTA games do but with sweet graphics, great compatability, and an awesome 3-character gameplay system. Add modding into the mix and the replayability is endless, and you can fine-tune your rampage experience into something more realistic and fun, or bizarre and wacky...Los Santos is your playground.THAT BEING SAID....Grand Theft Auto V Single Player (with mods) was my favorite video game ever. Vanilla GTA V is okay but thanks to the modding community it fleshed out into the game it was always supposed to be. Rockstar laid a great foundation for videogamers and creative minds alike to produce a game with limitless entertainment.This recent C&D on the developers of OpenIV by Take Two is upsetting beyond words.

You can only report individual hackers and not a hacked session. Most of the time you won't know who is hacking the session. And be warned, this GTA online hacking problem is not over exaggerated. It is unbelievably rampant. It's literally in nearly all sessions. Wanna do the new CEO or biker missions, prepare to have a modder take control of your vehicle and kill you, making the hours of work you did be for nothing. You really need to prepare yourself for the reality that you will do hours of work and have it completely ruined by modders. This will guarantee-ably happen to you if you play GTA online.

It was released in September 2013 for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, in November 2014 for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, and in April 2015 for Microsoft Windows. It is the first main entry in the Grand Theft Auto series since 2008's Grand Theft Auto IV. Set within the fictional state of San Andreas, based on Southern California, the single-player story follows three criminals and their efforts to commit heists while under pressure from a government agency.

79,650.3,Not Recommended, March 23,37,"This is a game that seems fun when you first look at it. You can play through a story by yourself or play online with friends. I rarely touched the story mode, since I was in it for the online gameplay. I had friends to play with and I convinced two of my friends to buy it because they wanted to play it with me.I was on my best behavior in the game. I tended to play with just my friends in public sessions, because so much of the community is toxic waste. This is worsened by the game having absolutely garbage PvP. You start off without good armor (and the best armor is still trash), low health, and weak weapons. If you have noone to play with early on, this game is brutal. You will be destroyed by people with either more time and progress in the game, people with more real life money, and/or the endless supply of modders godmodding, trapping, and killing people. This problem tends to not end even when you get better weapons, armor, and vehicles, because no matter what, explosive bullets will forever be broken as all hell. A Hydra (the game's version of the Harrior) with explosive bullets will destory ANYTHING. Armored vehicles are nothing against a barrage. Even the tankiest vehicles (including tanks) will be destroyed within a few seconds or less, thus it is really pointless to try and make money outside of heists if you don't know the trick to empty out sessions. Also, whenever I encountered a modder, I would do my best to report them in hopes that it would help stop the rampant modding that happens.I really did have fun playing, but Rockstar decided that I shouldn't be allowed to have fun. Without any explaination nor reason, I was banned from GTA Online with nearly 500 hours of time and effort invested in the game gone to waste. I try to contact Rockstar, because surely I can prove I'm innocent and maybe, just maybe I could get everything back and enjoy this game with my friends again.Nope. Rockstar Support is just a pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥ They automatically closed my ticket where I asked them to review my gameplay and tell me what I did wrong. I am still confident that if they did that, instead of relying on their garbage automated system (which the rampant modding clearly shows how badly it fails to work), they would see that no violation occurred, but they are too busy rolling in their money to give a care about the consumer.Stay far, far away from Rockstar and anything they make. This is a company that deserves nothing but bankruptcy. They will take your money, time, and energy, then punch you in the stomach without warning nor reason while walking away with everything you put into the game. Please, for the love of all that is good, put your money elsewhere. Never spend a single cent on Rockstar. I hope that their actions one day give them the consequences they deserve.EDIT: I have been unbanned and my progress was kept as-is, however, I'm not going easy on Rockstar. The way they handled the situation (not publically admitting an issue and having no communication with users on social media) was poor and I was not even notified my ban was removed! While I will return to the game once I know the false-positive issue is completely resolved, my trust is something that has to be earned. If Rockstar goes above and beyond with how they treat us, their customers, then I will be more than happy to give them a positive review and sing of their praise. Until then, I will continue to warn people of how they treat customers."

I thoroughly enjoyed the single player campaign, I played online mostly and had a a character legitimately over level 100 and with a nice sum of money set aside. I even supported the game further with the very occasional shark card. I was there for the DNS glitch that caused 9 billion dollar bounties to occur, and I was there when they cut literally everyone's funds to 500,000 as a ""fix""But one day I was playing and some guy joins the server, forcibly teleports myself and a handful of others to him, freezes us, and makes bags of money rain from the sky.Don't get me wrong, I'm not stupid, I know people hack and people give out money. I've seen countless people ask for them and praise them etc. I've generally ignored them, but this guy didn't give me much of a choice.Regardless once I figured out what was happening I left the server. I didn't want the money in my bank so I blew it customizing street cars and blowing them up.A couple hours later I was temporarily banned and my character was reset. I lost all of my cars, including old ones with rare paint jobs that could only be obtained by an exploit that had been patched, not to mention the majority of that 700 hours I'd put into having a character I liked.Rockstar punished me for something that was thrust upon me. My ingame wallet was♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and they decided to blame the victim.There was no way for me to voice my displeasure to Rockstar. No appeals process for them to hear my case, check the evidence, and see my innocence.That was several months ago. I uninstalled the game and let it go.I'm only writing this now so that others can see what they're getting into.Yes, as I've said, this game is incredibly fun and contains hours upon hours of content. From an objective standpoint, its very good value for money and the free, regular, DLC is a nice touch.What ruins all of that is the way Rockstar treats its customers. There's no consistency, and no compassion. I know people in real life that have been taking free money for ages and they've never had any trouble. Yet it happens to me once, without my consent, and I get temp banned and lose literally everything.What motivation is there to play legitimately then? If people who do can lose everything in an instant with no way to appeal the decision, and those who don't can get away with it indefinitely.Hell you actually get a bonus for playing illegitimately because those people can just make new accounts and hack their way back to wealth and experience.Rockstar, if you actually end up reading this, please start treating your customers with some compassion.

Hackers putting $2 billion bounties on people randomly... there was nothing more exciting than seeing every dot on the map suddenly turn and start chasing the bountiful bounty... So much money, though. Many would eventually split the massive amount of glitched money around the other players on the map. Hell-- Not like I even needed the $30 billion that would pile up on me.But, that would only land many player in ""virtual jail"", if even just receiving said glitched money. Even a phone call to Rockstar support wouldn't change this. I tell ya, being treated like a pseudo-criminal is one thing, but for the very people I PAID for the experience, to treat an honest and faithful customer of many years like a REAL criminal.... Absolutely DISGUSTING.Yes, I am bitter. May always be, at this rate. If the game could've just merited a little more attention OFFLINE (a.k.a. where I don't have to fear the Rockstar Police), then I might feel a bit more off-base with a ""Not Recommended"" review. However, this game is only getting development with the Online portion. And that is quite literally a ""Pay-to-play"" structure. Gameplay Online is severely reliant upon having the GTA$ to afford nearly every aspect of the game. Even other players can easily cost you money without even being cheaters.

214,278.1,Not Recommended," February 6, 2017",1,"We had fun in GTA Online before my friend got banned out of nowhere.Yeah, the public playerbase was pretty bad, and the business model was scummy, but truth be told, my overall experience was great.Playing mostly on private servers, my group of friends and I built characters from nothing together. As we made money, playing stupidly-fun minigames and going on deathmatch rampages, we created our characters’ lore. Buying new outfits, houses, and cars, we created the personalities and relationships between our characters. From the first convenience store robberies we committed to the “hard mode” heists we tried over and over to beat, everything we did spawned stories of our virtual lives.After 140+ hours of glorious, stupid fun, we took about a month’s hiatus. We played a few other group-based games, such as ESO and Don’t Starve Together, but we ended up feeling inclined to reunite our virtual characters in GTA Online. After this time away, we were ready to have some more fun, reuniting in a game that brought us all closer together as a group.That was until one of us logged on, saw that they had been suspended for 30 days, and read that their character had been completely reset.Why was our friend banned? Who knows. Based on what I’ve read (and we’ve been studying into it for hours in hopes of getting our friend's character back), there’s no hope. Rockstar’s employed some sort of algorithm that ends up banning both guilty hackers and innocent players alike out of nowhere, with no distinction. I’m not going to lie, when we went onto public servers we frequently met hackers. The issue is that my friend wasn’t one of them.“You have violated the EULA,” the suspension email states, “this decision is final.”Rockstar, you know how to make a really good game - Red Dead Redemption and both Grand Theft Auto 4 & 5 were excellent in single-player - but I can’t support this blatant lack of care for supporting your online players. 60 dollars and 140+ hours just went down the drain, because your robot randomly banned our friend, you won’t say why, and none of your “support” staff (if they even exist) care to respond to any players in the same situation.I won’t support this bafflingly unprofessional treatment of GTA Online’s playerbase.=====Basically, single player is great. Online can be as well, but good luck not getting suspended or banned out of nowhere, for no reason. You won’t know why you were banned. You won’t get support. You’ll lose time and money. And Rockstar won’t even care."

I didn't buy a shark card. I didn't hack. I didn't exploit. I grinded for several hours using the methlab to get 6 million dollars legitimately. I was going for 10 million so I could buy a yacht. Stupid investment, I know, but I really wanted that damn boat.And I woke up one morning, and got a message that said that Rockstar noticed an ""anomalous cashflow pattern"" in my account, and they had ""adjusted it accordingly"" All my money, except for about $2000, was gone.I got in contact with a customer service rep on the forums, and she informed me that the server reported that I was earning way too much money way too quickly to be playing legitimately, and told me that if I wanted my money back, I should just buy a shark card. She refused to give me back my money, refused to transfer me to a superior, and warned me that if I didn't drop the issue, I would be banned for cheating.Admittedly, at this point I started testing her, so she left the chat, and when I tried to contact another customer service rep, I was unable to, because, as expected, I was permanently banned from the Rockstar forums. I also received a 2-month ban from GTA Online.I know the singleplayer's good. I know the game is polished, and I know that I'm not the best player out there. This isn't about any of that. This is about a large game company using microtransactions to effectively hold hours worth of hard work for ransom.Rockstar has gone down the path of EA and Ubisoft in how much they treat their customers like dirt, and I don't want to just stand by and watch helplessly.

175,493.2,Not Recommended, February 10,663,"I will never buy another Rockstar game again, I simply can't because they don't give me any other option.Last year I got banned from online play. No, I'm not a cheater or hacker, which is why I'm writing this negative review.What I assume happened is the following;I hadn't played GTA since launch, but came across the ""LSPD"" mod on youtube. It's a mod that allows you to play as police singleplayer. I installed GTA and the mod and had a couple days of fun. I'm sure I accidentally pressed Online play with the mod loaded once, but killed the game right away.Then I uninstalled GTA via steam, and didn't play for -months-. The Christmas holidays came around, I had some spare time and installed GTA again. I played Online for an hour and got a 30day ban.I initially had no idea why, and no idea to find out, as there's zero response from support about bannings other than an automated response saying all bans are final. And to be honest I didn't care too much as I had only played for an hour, and didn't feel invested. I considered GTA5 Online to simply be broken. I uninstalled GTA again via steam and didn't think about it.But a couple weeks later my brother said he had gotten GTA5 during the steam christmas sales. So we waited for my 30day ban to be over, and had a week of fun playing the game. But then exactly 7 days to the dot after the 30 day ban was over, I got a permaban. I assume I got flagged for another ban the second I logged in again and simply had some kind of 7 day cooldown timer. Or perhaps they have/had a weekly (un)banwave I was ""lucky"" enough to play in between.Again I tried to contact support, again no response but the automated one.I tried asking for help on the forums, but there I got called a lying cheater, and actually harrassed by people, so gave up on that quickly.While googling for answers, I came across the LSPD mod again, which reminded me I had tried it before. I had a eureka moment, searched my computer, and came across some residual LSPD files from MONTHS, and a couple of full game reinstalls ago. I tried to contact support again, but still no human response. I gave up.Forward to now.After getting constantly reminded on Youtube about GTA5 videos of clearly modded ONLINE play, I'm still♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥I got banned for what I can only assume were some residual files from a mod that didn't affect my online game at all.And let's not forget, anyone who has ever played GTA5 Online, knows it's FULLLLL of REAL hackers/cheaters constantly messing up everyone's game by teleporting them around, killing whole servers, even dropping hacked money ontop of you.So I figured I'd see if Rockstar support had gotten any better since last year.To my surprise there's now a ""I don't want to get banned"", support request option. I'm pretty sure that wasn't there last year, so I at least got my hopes up on finally figuring out WHY I got banned.What's a better purpose for the ""I don't want to get banned"" support request than someone who doesn't know why he was banned and wants to prevent it from happening again. But no, just another automated message saying all bans are final and cannot be appealed, even though I wasn't asking for an appeal. My second support request, stating my first request wasn't a ban appeal but an inquiry with information about my first ban because ""I don't want to get banned, again"", got the same automated message saying all bans are final.Listen, don't get me wrong. If the anticheat system detected those residual files as malicious, I totally deserved the first ban.BUT.- I reinstalled the game several times. Technically I didn't do anything to the new installs, it did that to itself by not cleaning the folders it uses and not protecting itself from outside influences on a fresh install.- I had no way of figuring out why I got banned the first time, so no way to prevent it from happening again. I'm still only guessing it were those files. The only victims of not letting people know why they are getting banned by an ""anticheat"" system, are people who have no idea why the anticheat singled them out because they weren't actually cheating. I mean, mister l33th4xx0r can hack as much as he wants till his first ban, and then has a good idea what to do to not let it happen again.- Support is nonexistant, not for ""I want you guys to have a look at my ban"", nor ""Can you at least help me to not get banned again"", despite having a specific ticket request option for it.- Again, both youtube and the game itself are FULL of real actual hackers/cheaters, and people using non malicious mods online seemingly for long periods of time with no risk, or even sense of wrongdoing, of getting banned during online play.I think it's simple;GTA5 has so many players, but also so many real hackers/cheaters, that they ban such an enormous amount of people every week, with thousands of them making false ban appeals, that they can't search, and perhaps don't care, to look for those few who deserve a second opinion because the banning is perhaps the result of an over zealous anticheat program on their side.So I simply cannot buy another Rockstar game again, nor recommend it to anyone else. If I can't get support to at least figure out why I got banned, it may happen again in the future, and it may happen to you."

Instead we got a lackluster main story that does a total 360 and ends with nothing having changed for any of the characters and boring or just poorly-written plotlines. Then GTA Online happened. Instead of being like GTA IV Online with more to do and fun game modes and being able to ♥♥♥♥ around, it follows an awful MMO-styled design method where the work is repetitive and boring, the pay is awful, and everything is insanely expensive so you are forced to either grind the same high-paying work over and over, or pay real life money for in-game cash so you can actually enjoy your $60 game.And that's not even including Take Two's absolutely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ stance on modding. Instead of keeping their policy of keeping mods in single-player, they have issued a (completely unfounded and unlawful) Cease and Desist to the OpenIV team, who have designed and maintained the key modding tool for the game. Without it, mods are nigh impossible to make/install/update. So on top of the game itself being lackluster and designed to sap money from its playerbase, now modding is essentially banned so that players are unable to get new, fresh content and gameplay in their singleplayer experience, and instead are forced to wait for content updates to come that they must grind/pay real money for.This game is the embodiment of everything that is wrong with the game industry today. Basically zero focus on singleplayer experiences, multiplayer designed with microtransactions in mind, and absolutely backwards views and stances towards modding.

98,714.6,Not Recommended," September 30, 2017",298,"Okay so, after having put in some nearly 600 hours in the game I feel its time to make a review.Graphics wise on PC, the game is pretty solid if you have the hardware required. You can see it wasn't just a straight port from consoles. The attention to detail in sounds, dialogs and everything is quite astonishing! The singleplayer story is interesting, though some characters mainly Trevor just feel kind of... forced. That is excuseable however since everything is in order and with quite some polishing put into it. There's plenty to do singleplayer wise, altough until now there is no word as to singleplayer DLC's like the episodic DLC's for GTA IV.The bad thing when it comes to singleplayer is mods. Not too long ago, the developers decided that modding this game is bad, and that you should feel bad if you mod it, pretty much killing the entire modding comunity from day to night. That has generate some huge backlash (take a look at other reviews).Now let's get to the rotten core of this review, the multiplayer aspect of the game. Now, you have to understand, when the game was just released on PC, the first week of online play was quite nice, barring server issues but even those weren't that much of a problem and most of the issues started to rise later on and most of them are still very much unadressed up until now.The first big issue is the amount of hackers in game. It was worse, but it's still quite bad. Often times you will find yourself in a lobby where you get exploded out of nowhere. Or have an UFO and other things spawned on top of your head pretty much preventing you from doing anything. You may also find that the streets and roads have turned to quick sand meaning you'll end up driving a few feet and your car will get dragged back to the starting point over and over and over again. That won't happen if you're on foot though. Shortly after you will get sniped by someone on the other side of the map as they also simultaneously snipe everyone else. You will also occasionaly be teleported to other places or face people with machine guns that are fed with rocket belts.Other than the issues mentioned above with hackers, the main issue is hackers dropping tons of money out of the sky on top of you, most of the time also preventing you from avoiding these pickups and turning you into a millionaire by accident. On any other world this would be a good thing but it is not in GTA Online, as Rockstar has been known to occasionally ban players who receive hacked money. They don't really seem to worry much about you getting hacked XP points though, or so the community has pointed out. As of the latest hacked money wipe a lot of people who earned quite a few bucks legitimately with the double money events also had their legitimate gains wiped out with the Smuggler's run update that added hangars and a variety of helicopters and planes.Speaking of the online DLC, here's the really crippling issue, that seems to outweight the bugs, hackers and everything else with online. While the online aspect of the game is free to play and you can build your own fortune from the ground up, there are ""soft pay walls"" that will likely lock you out of the DLC content in online as it is quite frankly, extremely expensive. The most recent DLCs, Smuggler's Run and Gun Running are a very good example of one such thing, with most of the content requiring a few millions for you to purchase a hangar and the vehicles you want. If you happen to want cold war era bomber tough luck because it will cost you over 5 millions to buy it, + a few more depending on the hangar of your choice.With the gun running DLC, it's the same issue. You will need to buy a bunker in order to research the upgrades for your vehicles. Want an APC with missile launchers? You'll have to buy the bunker then research it. But here's the thing, you CANNOT choose the type of research to perform so if you're unlucky, it'll be the last thing on your list. Of course you can boost these research projects at a cost of about 220,000 each, and if you boost them all it'll cost you a whopping 11 millions in online currency. Then you will also need to buy a mobile command center WITH a vehicle workshop and then buy the APC, and then spend the money to add the missile turret to it. Oh, and it doesn't lock on aircraft.Now you may be thinking that making a few millions in this game isn't so bad... Well... it is. It really is. When you think about a tough grind, you might think of World of Tanks and it is quite a grind indeed, but it's not as bad as GTA Online's. The regular jobs you get from contacts... Sure, do them so you can get a good amount of RP, but don't trust them to net you any significant amount of money. Heists can be interesting if you're the leader, where you'll take most of the payday after the heist finale. But they're much harder and it is very difficult to find a team that will not troll you, will not act as idiots and will not generally just give you a VERY bad time.There are other options such as exporting cars once you buy the car garage, but don't exepct it to be as easy since you have to source the car, pay for the repair on it if it gets damaged, then pay for the mods if you want to sell it at a high value and then whatever damage it sustains from your warehouse to the delivery point, comes out of your commission. Oh, and expect plenty of military helicopters and jets to try and succesfully bomb your while you're delivering the car, causing you to lose money on it.You can get around this grind if you can shell out money for the shark cards. The ones that give you any real amount of money that you'd be able to actually spend on things you might like are more expensive than the game itself. And with each online DLC, odds are you'd need AT LEAST 2 or maybe 3 of that one specific card. One DLC comes to mind where the total amount of vehicles and other assets you could purchase totals in the 33,000,000 for all the content, so unless you plan on making GTA Online your full time job, you will likely not see most of the online content. The exception being if you were lucky enough to be playing it when it was released on the PS3 and Xbox 360 and where around when the ""moneypocalypse"" happened and you're pretty much an in game billionaire.And by the way, the online DLC content that comes from time to time, does not get put in the singleplayer portion of the game and you'd only be able to access with mods, which are not okay according to GTA V developers.Edit - 25/10/2017: As of recently, rockstar has announced there will be no singleplayer DLC for GTA V. Also, corrected some bad spelling and non-sensical sentences in this review.TL;DR The singleplayer portion of the game isn't bad, but don't expect any singleplayer DLC soon. The online portion is riddled with connection problems, hackers, trolls and is somewhat toxic. The DLC content for online does not get put on singleplayer and is safely tucked away behind a soft paywall (which is actually a VERY thick paywall). The only real way to get significant online currency is buying shark cards that are pretty expensive and you'd need several with each DLC to be able to access all the content."

59,441.2,Not Recommended," December 12, 2017",635,"When it comes to the campaign you are gonna enjoy it because it is really good, but the main reason for people coming to play this game is GTA Online for sure and I can tell you that it's current state is terrible ! Why ? I have 400 hours on PC, plus another 400 on ps3 when it came out, so I'm gonna try to be as clear as possible.GTA Online is about making money by playing missions, heists, doing jobs like stealing cars and selling them, sell cocain from Cocain lab, selling weapons from bunker where they are made etc., and you can spend that money on cool cars, luxury appartements, weapons, private jets, helicopters, war vehicles etc. Sounds cool right ? Well there is a problem.At beggining when the game came out the prices for these things were reasonable, but now in the last couple of new updates and with Import/Export things, the prices are just awful. They keep getting higher and higher and it has become so much harder to buy cool things that you want and in that way, they are trying to make you buy their ""Shark Cards"" which is really not worth, even the 75$ card that gives you 8.000.000 $ is not enough, you are gonna need more than that to buy things here, because when you buy something, you still have to costumize it if you want it to look and be better which also really costs. If you wanna get the money normally, you can either repeat the heists or do the Import/Export jobs since those ways are best for making money, but they still don't give you the money that you really deserve nowadays and for Import/Export jobs, it really takes a lot of time to get the money that you need, even friends that help you can't get the deserving money. For example, I still didn't even manage to sell the weapons from the bunker cause it really takes a lot of time for them to be ready for sale and btw, the only way to get the stock ready for sale, for either weapons, drogs, weed, whatever, is to be active in session, ONLY ! The stocks can't get full while you are for example playing heists or some missions or car races with your friends. And when I want to sell a product, for example two cars with my friend, I will get 200.000$ while my friend is only gonna get 20.000$ ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t ! That's how Rockstar is trying to keep their players playing here, by spending thousands of hours repeating the same things that are really NOT worth and they try to make you buy their ♥♥♥♥ing ""Shark Cards"" and even that is still not worth your money at all ! Please for the love of GOD, don't fall in to a trap thinking that buying shark cards is gonna help you. This really shows how Rockstar became greedy. You think "" Yes ! There is new content coming and like every, it's FREE ! "", but when you see how expensive the content is, you just get really disappointed. Here is the best example of it, when the first heists came out, you only had to buy an appartement which had a specific room for that and the cheapest one was about 250.000 $ which was not that hard to get and now you can play 5 heists, but with these new ones that just came out, you have to buy a facility to play the heists and the facilities cost from 1.500.000 $ ???? ♥♥♥♥ THAT ! It's faster to get bankrupt here, then to be rich, SO WHAT'S THE POINT !If you wanna play this game because of the campaign, go for it and I suggest you to get it on sale, but if you wanna enjoy GTA Online, you will maybe like it at beggining like I did when it came out, but that was when prices were reasonable and when you figure out how expensive new content has become, not to mention hackers and unfair bans, you will see how horrible GTA Online really is. Yes, you can also ♥♥♥♥ around with your friends and race, but it's really not worth your time if you are gonna be doing only that, even for that you need money, especially if you wanna have fun with cool things."

260,159.6,Not Recommended," August 4, 2017",552,"Single PlayerThe Single Player is beyond one of the most enjoyable campaigns I have ever played. The story is good and the characters are diverse. It's also a lot of fun to use Native Trainer/Open IV/ etc. to mod and break the game sometimes. I've had loads of fun playing the fun and story driven missions. The first person view isn't the best camera angle you want to use but it's very considerate for Rockstar to add a feature like that into the game. The playtime is astronomically long and the only bad thing I can say about he single player is that the controls on Keyboard/Mouse are really hard to use while in combat or just freeroaming. So I definitely recommend you use a controller.MultiplayerSwitching my Characters from PS4 to PC was painless. I was lucky to be able to transfer my account without any errors. But Online is just as bad as it was on console. Most of the missions I played were very unsatisfying and gave low rewards. Everything is just so damn expensive! I'm very disappointed in Rockstar for implementing this terrible economy and having you to buy Shark cards to get the things you want. The shark cards are a rip off, $20 in real life money for 1 million dollars in game money is a terrible deal. The apartments don't give that much purpose either (Except for storing cars which you can buy a stand alone garage for much less). The heists are very frustrating. If you're doing it with trusted friends then it won't be so bad (Besides the super long mission). But if you're playing solo it might be a rough time for you. If one player screws up a part of the plan the whole mission restarts. I just wish Rockstar would make the missions a lot more pleasant and fulfilling. The Online portion of the game is not that great and very stressful. I wish Rockstar would listen to the community and take into consideration of the Communities Reviews and Complaints."
103,128.4,Not Recommended," December 13, 2017",491,"TL;Dr Microtransaction Paywalls prohibit any reasonable access to the game. Some items in the game are priced higher than the game it self if you look at Shark Card prices for reference. seems to be the only thing Rockstar enforces aside from spammed reports from players on griefers is Permabanning anyone that attempts to get around their ridiculous pay walls to ""Free Updates""Heres the deal, this game is fun, its funny, well made, the reason I DO NOT RECOMMEND is because of the detestable microtransactions. For example, this game was on sale for $29.99 at the time I write this. The new update that adds ""The Ultimate Heist"" adds a Delorean that flies and shoots rockets and what not. In the scale of shark cards. that single vehicle is worth $50 sitting at 4mil GTA$ while an 8mil shark card costs $100 usually. throw in the fact you have to buy a ""Facility"" before you can even buy the car, add 1.6-4.5mil on top of the value depending on what you choose in the way of ""Facilities"". Congratulations, that SINGLE vehicle in the game now costs about $70. MORE THAN THE PRICE OF THIS GAME WHEN IT WAS BRAND NEW! lets add to that fact with the ""Gunrunners update"" going as cheaply as we can just to get started. spend about 1.2 mil on the bunker, no upgrades. spend another 1.2mil on the ""Mobile Operations Center"" which is what actually makes the cool features of the bunker functional. OH♥♥♥♥♥♥ BUT WAIT! to even buy one of these bunkers or facilities, you need an Office, a Motorcycle club, etc. Something that lets you actually own any of the money making businesses. so the Delorean actually costs closer to 80-90 bucks, I digress, To get even the first bit of the cool stuff in any of these ""Free Updates"" you have to A.) Grind for days. (I've made about 1.5Mil in the past week, with three businesses and a basic bunker, supplemented with a ton of the 2x Rp 2x $ Motor Wars game mode) or B.) Spend easily 450 dollars to get the rest of the content in the game supplemented by weeks of grinding for the smaller stuff. OR C.) Find a hacker to give you money, which brings me to my last pointRockstar doesn't ban anyone for anything, even hackers, UNLESS THEY BYPASS THEIR MICROTRANSACTIONS! I know a lot of those old reviews say ""Hurr Durr I got banned for this"" thats probably because they were being a♥♥♥♥♥♥to every one in the game and got reported a dozen times a day for griefing, OR they didn't mention a hacker just gave them like 25 mil and they started spending it really quickly. that triggers a autoban system from what I can tell.Im done with rockstar until they make it reasonable or enjoyable to play their game. I like a challenge and earning items in a game, but my 103 hours in GTA Online has yielded 11.4mil about $135 worth of in game currency. Tonight I met a hacker. and in the span of 10 minutes bumped my balance to 126 mil($1350ish in shark cards). I didn't even do anything with it. Got signed out of my account and now I can't log in. ♥♥♥♥ you Rockstar. I didn't even ask for the damn money."
175,741.9,Not Recommended," May 12, 2016",1,"So I don’t really write reviews, I’m too lazy or just don’t have the time in my life.But for this game I’m willing to bother, mainly because of the ATROCITIES that this game possesses. Single player is great sure, but online is such a bigger part of this game now, most people play it just for that mode. But I’m sure you’ve seen other reviews saying: “modders have ruined it!” and “online is no fun cos of hackors!”.Well that’s because it’s true. All of it.Allow me to put this as realistically as possible.I have amassed a total of 420 hours on GTAV. Didn’t play the campaign, I had already done that when it first arrived on console. No, these hours are mainly online play. I’ve grinded mission after mission to earn the cash. I’ve spent hours buying, customizing and completing challenges. I now have a profile that has all the levelled unlocks, cars and guns you could ever want, making it a very hard earned profile.HOWEVER, I have now lost most (if not all) of my desire to switch this game on, and I’m sure you have a pretty good idea of why that is. Nether the less, I shall give you an example of a typical session of online play if you were to enter the game today (which let’s face it, is the main reason why we play it).Enter my first match. > begin attempt to have fun. > Player arrives on a bike and kills me to death. > very well, I shall retaliate by firing a rocket at his bike. > Rocket hits. > But wait, the player didn’t die. > Then quickly learn from further attempts and other players that he is using God-mode > I then attempt to use the player menu to ‘vote to kick’ him, as others were attempting to do the same thing > Turns out he has used a mod that removes his name from the player list, making it impossible to kick him out of the match. > I then call him out for using Mods (with restraint to call him many, many things) > At this point he proceeds to delete my car and spawn 100,000 things on my head, making my game crash to desktop (and probably anyone else who was near-by in game).Now after lots and lots of match surfing, I can quite confidently state the following with applied calculation and experience:So to give you an evaluation:Prepare to have unfair play, have your things deleted, and get crashed to desktop by modder’s whenever you challenge their actions, because Rockstar will never regulate and control this issue.You can enjoy being invincible, gank on players then delete everyone’s things, and if they call you out you can just crash everyone, because you are a big man and Rockstar will never regulate or control this issue. Then they’ll write negative reviews, losing the game its popularity to a point where it just becomes garbage. Then you’ll have it all to yourself, and your mission to alienate everyone from online play will be complete.To quote another game (that I would recommend more tbh):“Well done Stanley, everyone thinks you’re very powerful.”P.S - The second biggest issue is the micro-transactions, and rockstar's ever vigilant attempt to take in-game money from you in order to force you into buying shark cards with real money. but that needs a whole review in itself to detail that issue (which i really dont have the time in my life for).My only hope is that enough people will see this review and get it to the bench, so that maybe some people will decide not to ruin this game with bad modder/hacker behaviour.Rockstar did a ban wave and disabled the ability to use console (apparently), soo... yay?Wonder if my moaning review had some sort of effect, anyway im going to leave this here just as a principle.Well here we are again. Rockstar have dropped the ball and now modder/hackers/whatever you wanna call them, have returned. Its worse than ever now. Back to the drawing board...."

You can then go look at the recent dlc's and see a price of 10x the first vehicles.-Hackers are everywhere and none are really getting detected and banned. Atleast not enough for the game to be playable without hackers everywhere.-They recently banned modding in singleplayer in hopes of making SP players go to MP instead. (Allegedly it was to stop hackers in MP, even though this ain't how it works.) So now the only thing that's getting updated with new stuff is the MP part.-Some of all the stuff you can do to make money can't be done without being in a session with other players, which means you're kinda FORCED to be with hackers and rich people with big jets.

147,201.3,Not Recommended," June 16, 2017",28,"First, I'd like to say I bought this game three times. Once for PS3 on release, then PS4, and again here on Steam when I finally decided to build a gaming PC. This should be a testament to the overall quality of this game's single player alone as I have no real interest in the multiplayer component due to Rockstar's and Take Two's business model and their priorities. However, that said, I have had this game's Social Club render itself defunct for no reason multiple times every week. No matter how many times I reinstall the game and the Social Club, it eventually re-breaks for no reason within the week. While this doesn't impact the quality of the game itself when it works, it very clearly shows how inept Rockstar is at making sure this sort of issue doesn't happen (150 AAA games installed on my PC and one has this issue: GTA5).The music is on-point and fits the game and the story very well and each of the three main characters are all well-written. The story, while good, feels a bit all over the place at first but I genuinely feel it is due to how much the story seems to just rush. What I mean by that is that it seems like things just keep escalating and escalating for the main characters, rushing from one crazy event to another to another. While it was enjoyable the entire way through, that pacing of the story made it feel a little disjointed for me at times despite making perfect sense. The ending was also a bit lackluster and felt rushed in a bad way to me. An arbitrary A, B, and C choice with one being a very obvious ""right choice"". Two choices lead to less satisfying endings and the other leads to an ending that is very clearly a ""tie up loose ends"" mission both literally and narratively. You kill all of the antagonists you run into in the game in a mission that simply screams ""we had to wrap it up somehow"". That said, it should be noted I've beaten the main story four times. While it has some very glaring flaws narratively, it's still a fun time.Now on to the multiplayer... The reason I'm not into it is actually not due to me being primarily a single-player-focused gamer but also because of how the entire thing is set up. I played Red Dead Redemptions Free Roam multiplayer for hours upon hours and enjoyed it despite it being fairly empty. GTA Online? It's even emptier than Red Dead Redemption. In order to have any fun whatsoever, you need to make in-game money. You do this by playing deathmatches, heists, races, and various other game modes. The problem is that the payouts are so incredibly low that you will need to grind for countless hundreds of hours to get enough money to keep up with the updates (and this game, while fun, is nowhere near good enough to warrant that type of dedication). The reason for this is so they can get you to spend literally hundreds of dollars on microtransactions. In fact, when GTAO launched, the payouts were actually reasonable and balanced only to be nerfed to insane degrees just to make their Shark Card sales not only more enticing but make it damn near the only way to legitimately have fun in this game.This turns people to script mods that give them hundreds of millions of in-game money to circumvent this unethical business model. Many modders, however, go further by making themselves invincible, invisible, can insta-kill anyone, and do anything you can think of to ruin your fun. In response, Take Two put an end to OpenIV, which is literally only used for single-player mods (like graphics mods that don't even work on multiplayer). Eventually, Take Two reversed that decision and began allowing OpenIV to be used again for Single Player modding.However, just a couple short months later has Take 2 and R* stripping a very large number of players of their in-game currency. They started up an event where warehouse missions, which are the best way to make money in the game (despite still being abysmally lower than they should be) yielded twice as much money. People grinded those things from the event's start to finish. When the Smugglers Run DLC hits? A large number of them see ALL of their money whiped. Everyone who contacts R* about this then just gets sent automated, cookie-cutter responses from their automated system and then ignored. Seriously, and then people wonder why this game has such a severe problem with modders online. Maybe it's because R* actively goes out of its way to screw EVERYONE and, as a result, gives everyone a valid reason to say ""♥♥♥♥ your microtransactions, I'm going to pay a modder $15 for $100M rather than pay R* $1,250 for $100M"". Then there's the fact that the only bug fixes R* does are GTAO money glitches (there are still many bugs left over from the PS3/360 release) and how R* never began work on the three expansions they claimed GTA5's single player was going to get because GTAO padding their wallets was more important.It's very easy for me to say that I can recommend GTA5's single player, but I cannot in good concience recommend GTAO. If I rated the two parts seperately, the single player is a solid 8/10 with the multiplayer being a 4/10 (6/10 when with friends) at the very most even when you ignore the ethics behind R* and Take Two's decisions."
375,162.6,Not Recommended," June 18, 2017",28,"Over 50 new vehicles along with tons of other content have been added in updates since the game released on PC, but none of it is available in singleplayer. The only way to access this content is via online multiplayer, where you have to slowly grind for ingame money or pay real money for pricey ""shark cards"". Many of the cars cost over a million ingame dollars before you even customise them, and $100 of real money only gets you 8 million ingame dollars. This is on top of the game still costing $60 years after release and rarely ever going on sale.Previously it was possible to enjoy update content in singleplayer through the use of mods, however the game's publisher has recently begun cracking down on singleplayer mods and threatening legal action against the creators of said mods.The best part of GTA to me has always been the extensive freedom to experiment with lots of cars and weapons and other neat toys in an expansive sandbox world, and all these restrictions are unprecedented for the series. All development focus now seems to be on monetizing the online multiplayer, and I am fearful for the future of this series. At this point I cannot recommend the game to anyone who doesn't have limitless disposeable income to get around the MMO-style grind, since massive amounts of the game's content is unavailable in singleplayer for seemingly no other reason than incetivizing multiplayer microtransactions."

You get punished for killing and destroying players and their vehicle in MP. Price inflation because of the microtransaction is a constant issue and the game without paying is grindy as all get out.There is no online mode that allows you to mess with the the game. You can't for example have fun going on a rampage, because the game actively punishes you, both for setting you to be aggressive and also monetarily. Everything costs money. Weapons are locked behind a ranking system plus a cost, so when you are new and try to get into online, you will probably get killed by people that already have those unlocked with no recourse. Armored vehicles that cannot be destroyed without explosives will be the bane of your existance.And of course they tried to kill off the modding community.

The greatness shines in the singleplayer with its amazing and flamboyant narrative, good character development, and well-written dialogue. I would certainly recommend buying the game purely for the story mode - at a discount of course. I don't think it's worth the $59.99 price tag as it is. If you're a fan of a good crime narrative, GTA V is definitely the game for you.Perhaps the weakest element of GTA V is the online mode. Most of the reviews here are complaining about the modders, hackers, false bans, and griefing players who ruin the experience for other players, which is quite true. However, let's dive into the more fundamental elements of the online mode's overall design structure. This review will be mainly about the online experience, as Rockstar continues to update the game's online sessions with new adversary modes and DLC today. If you're buying the game solely for the online experience, exercise caution.DESIGN : In a nutshell, GTA V's online design is nothing short of awful. The menus are incredibly cluttered with lists upon lists of jobs (mission, races, stunt races) to do, and some of them don't show up. If you want to do a mission, you'll need to scroll through menus of needless tabs just to get to your specific mission unless you bookmark it. If you want to do missions with your friends, you'll need to go through multiple loading screens to start them. Loading back to free-roam takes a few minutes.Matchmaking is some of the worst I've seen in an online experience; it can take anywhere from one to fifteen minutes to gather a group of 2-4 players together to do any mission. When the game actually does pair you up with someone else - assuming you don't have many friends who play the game - it is with literally any player with any skill level. The game will sometimes pair a high-level player with most of the weapons and rewards unlocked with a low-level player with most of the weapons locked, often causing the job to fail due to player inexperience. Invites sometimes don't reach your friends, glitches with menus occur, and there are still many gamebreaking bugs that prevent the online mode from being a decent experience.If you're a fresh player just joining GTA V Online, good luck - most of the weapons are locked behind a level requirement. It will take you weeks to months to gain enough reputation to get the weapon you want - rocket launchers, grenade launchers, explosives, etc. Rockstar can also dish out permanent bans regardless of behavior, and you cannot appeal them. In summary, don't anger Rockstar.: Very unforgiving. At times, the AI will be perfectly cunning, dodging and weaving around obstacles to gun you down where you stand. During missions and heists however, most of them are unfair. They never seem to miss; they always have their reticles glued to you, so the moment you pop your head out to return fire, they quickly whittle away what little health you have.You can restore health in combat with snacks - purchased from convenience stores around Los Santos in free roam/freemode. If you want to heal when you're being gunned down by police, mercenaries, or gangsters, you guessed it; you need to open your interaction menu, scroll down to inventory, scroll down to snacks, and spam the enter key to heal your character, then exit the menu to resume combat. Run out of snacks or armor during a mission? You will need to quit to freemode, drive to another convenience store - or CEO office - and restock them. Buy too much and the convenience store will run out of snacks, forcing you to drive to another convenience store to buy more. How inconvenient.The AI isn't easy at all online, and requires precise movements, well-stocked equipment and health, and pure luck to beat them down.: Some online jobs - similar to quests in an RPG - require you to have more than 2 players. If you start a solo session or an invite only session, most of the fun jobs are all closed off, with Rockstar prompting you to join a public session with other unpredictable players in the lobby, because Rockstar wants the playerbase to mingle. In hindsight, it might seem like a great way to connect with other players, but with the hit-or-miss community of ""public lobby"" GTA V Online coupled with matchmaking flaws, it's difficult to get anything done.Want to do a heist? You are required to gather 4 players together to do them. Individual heist setups can take anywhere from 5-20 minutes. If you fail a heist setup? Moreoften, you may restart from a checkpoint and try it again. If a player leaves the heist setup? Everyone fails the mission, and the party leader will need to exit to freemode, go back to their apartment, re-initiate the heist, and find 4 new players, rinse and repeat. Heist finales contain the highest payouts, with rewards spanning from $80,000 to $200,000 depending on the heist, and can range anywhere between 10-30 minutes to complete. There are rarely checkpoints in heist finales; players have team lives instead of individual lives. If one player dies, your team loses a life, and in 99% of the heist finales, only one team life is available. Therefore, if one player continues to die and uses up your team's lives, you will need to replay the entire heist finale from the beginning or checkpoint. If one player leaves or disconnects while the heist is in progress, you will need to gather another 4 players to do the heist finale from the start.: GTA V Online's playerbase is really a hit or miss, though they should be somewhat feared. There are some decent and friendly players who are looking to have fun with heists, rewards, and such, but the majority of the time you'll be killed the moment you leave your apartment - run over by cars, sniped from afar, etc; this can be combatted with the game's passive mode - a mode in which other players cannot attack you, and you cannot attack other players or pedestrians. The problem with this mode is that you can't rob stores, take part in public lobby events, or defend yourself when the cops begin pursuing you.Also, there doesn't appear to much of a localization option with other players; you are grouped together with players from around the world. God forbid you get paired up in a serious heist where communication is next to impossible due to a language barrier. 50% of the time, you'll luckily encounter an English-speaking player. Most of the other players are from other countries, which makes coordinating missions and jobs frustrating if you or others don't speak a common language.: The game's online items and cars are progressively getting more and more expensive. Super/hypercars cost upwards of $1,000,000 to $6,000,000. There is a plane in-game for $10,000,000. Luxury yachts go from $6,000,000 to $10,000,000. CEO offices go from $1,000,000 to $6,000,000. Apartments go anywhere from $40,000 to $2,000,000. If you're earning $10,000 per job, and about $80,000 per heist in a great while, you bet it will take a long time to buy the things you want. Rockstar releases ""free DLC"" every few months, which are nothing more than introductions of new vehicles and buildings with inflated price tags. Don't want to play the game to earn money? Simply buy shark cards. $20 USD gets you 1.2 million dollars. $100 USD gets you 8 million dollars. And Rockstar wonders why modders and money hackers grow by the minute. The business model with ""free DLC"" is simply a hellish sanctuary for micro-transactions. You're not buying a $60 game. You're conned into paying for a $500+ game; that is, unless you either grind out every bit of cash slowly, or stay the heck away from online.Overall? Beautiful story.

When your parent company flat out wants to squeeze every last dime out of it's daily player base as possible.GTA V is one of my favorite open world games of all time. It's a beautiful, well crafted world with interesting SP missions and a functional (hic) online. That said, I bought this game knowing it would be modded like every GTA game has been for like 15 years. I also bought it on the basis of GTA Online being something I could play regularly and have decent progression and have a vain hope of unlocking content in without devoting my 24/7 life to grinding for money.With the shoe horning of Shark Cards and an ENDLESS STREAM of supremely overpriced content online with little actual FUN content added to it, that makes me actually want to play it for fun rather than feel like I""m grinding for cash every waking minute...It completely ruined the experience of GTA Online. Who really wants to farm cash to blow $10M on an in-game car or plane? For reference, that's more than $100 USD--REAL WORLD MONEY-- worth of premium 'Micro'-Transaction shark cards if you wanted to just skip the time and buy a plane.Pair that with the fact that there has not once been an update to GTA V's Single Player mode---More importantly, you can NEVER get the premium Online vehicles in Single player to mess around with and enjoy. The VTOL Hydra? Nope. All those amazing super cars? Nope. Low-riders and super bikes with boost? Nope. Rolling tank military SUVs delivered to your doorstep? Nope. None of it.That was, until the glorious modding community came around and added all the best features and content of GTA Online, BACK into Single player for all of us to use. That was great! I could play the game the way I wanted, access all the content I've paid for, and I don't have to deal with online players destroying my vehicles if I don't want to....That is, however until the Corporate Overlords at Take Two Interactive decided to file a cease-and-desist claim against OpenIV, the primary crew that made modding GTA IV and GTA V possible. The best tool available to make all other mods compatible, and the very backbone of SINGLE PLAYER mods in GTA V.Yes. Single Player. Despite their claims that OpenIV is 'allowing exploits into the GTA Online world', it is not. OpenIV has nothing to do with online; It it a closed-source software (So no one can exploit the reverse engineered software to hack the game illegitimately), and it even DISABLES itself if you go online. So none of your mods will carry over. They purposely built the utility to tick all the boxes and keep the software for single player use only. But that doesn't stop TTI from shutting them down on the basis of it being ""Harmful to their online community"".Well, sorry to tell you, but the Online in GTA V is already a vile hell with a plethora of third-party hacks that have nothing to do with OpenIV--THOSE are the people that need to be getting cease-and-desist orders. Not the one team that did everything in their power to keep their tool on the up-and-up and appeal to Take Two/Rockstar's wishes for online to be *their* property with no outside mods.***UPDATE June 23, 2017***As of writing, it appears that Take Two have stepped down, at least to a degree, and that OpenIV is back in action and being updated. So, potential for modding may have returned.That said, this review will remain negative due to the fact they not only TRIED to pull a massively anti-consumer practice and only turned around after massive backlash. But also the fact that the last two years since the game's release on PC have been nothing but endless efforts to add more and more costly updates to GTA Online, but they also have done nothing to support the Single Player. And as this recent debacle shows, they are actively trying to get people away from the Single Player and into GTA-O, because the SP doesn't net them a constant stream of microtransaction money.Frankly, GTA Online is one of the worst grinds for content I've come across in recent years. Modding things into SP is the only way for many like myself, who have actual day jobs and responsibilities, to even access half of GTA 5's content in a reasonable time frame."

Contacted their support via ticket, and was told 'the ban was permanent', and they closed the ticket. Called their support, even told them I had video proof of not cheating, and they said 'the ban is permanent', and hung up on me.EDIT: Because people were complaining about a 7 1/2 hour video (something I did to show my transition from working to playing GTA) I've uploaded the video to YouTube. The video has cut out me working, and goes straight to moments before I open Steam, and run GTA, to the moment I get banned:Despite being permanently banned for absolutely no reason, the game's online experience is horrible, littered with cheaters and frequent disconnects and bugs. Loading screen takes about four minutes, even on an SSD. Missions get canceled as players get booted from the online service due to Rockstar's terrible online servers. Joining sessions with your friends are hit-and-miss, and you'll likely get kicked offline to single-player many times while joining any online session, only to be greeted by the four-minute loading screen again. You can actually see this problem occur in my video. The game never logs in the first time I create my character, and I have to do it again. It's about ten minutes before I even get to play.If you choose to buy the game, do it for the single-player campaign. The characters in the game are likeable and well-designed, and the missions are pretty fun to do. If you're buying the game for the online experience, don't expect anything at all besides a horrible time. Thankfully for me, I don't really care about being banned from GTA, as I only bought it for single-player in the first place and have beaten the campaign and gotten most of the achievements. I typically don't review products, but I thought it was important for others to know there's a possibility of being banned without warning and without reason."

Might be related to something with the update but they won't acknowledge it or fix anything.They also had an event last week paying double, then took that money away too after the event ended from pretty much everyone I know who plays this.This whole thing is actually worse than the last issue since this affects real money purchases as well as 100s of hours of your time/life at risk if you farm money instead of buying it, with clueless support agents closing tickets after giving copy/paste responses. If this has happened to you, you should copy and paste my review into your own review, add/change whatever you want and send a message to Rockstar Games.It also looks like others are putting up similar reviews. This is a real problem happening right now to both people who earn the money playing normally and people who purchase Shark Cards. either way Rockstar just takes it. Their support can't even give you a true reason why if you continously inquire about it. I opened 5 tickets since and have gotten different excuses as to why they took my PAID for money. None of them make sense or relate to one another. I honestly don't think they even know that this is an issue with the anticheat flagging legitimate players. I am leaving this up until they refund people their money though. Rockstar shouldn't be allowed to get away with this and do not trust doing anything with this game at this point. No game has EVER taken away money or items I bought with real money, EVER.They could easily fix this seeing that people who poured 100s to 1000s of hours into this game aren't cheaters and return our money. Cheaters always want fast payoffs, they never learn the ins and outs of games or at least traditionally from the ones I've run into in other games on Steam.

It takes waaay to long to load online (close to 5 minutes on a high end pc like mine) and once you get there it is miserable to play. Nearly every session i have joined the past 2 weeks has at least one hacker either giving everyone money, or just running around with invincibility killing everyone. What finally pushed me over the edge is when I was playing online with a friend doing our own thing and then all of a sudden everyone on the server dies because they are crushed by falling rocks, then there is a clone of the character stuck to my body and even after killing it and myself, it just stayed. It only gets worse, my friend and I didn't mind it to much and it was a bit comical at times, but then we are all killed again except this time blown up which destroyed my car that I had to make the claim on and drained all cash and removed all guns. About 30 seconds after that it was flooded, literally. I did what a responsible person would do and reported the hacker as i have to most of the other hackers that I pass by and what does Rockstar do? Nothing. Absolutely &%$#ing nothing to the point where I saw the same hacker a week later doing the same thing in a different server. It has gotten to the point where I don't even bother playing online anymore because you simply can't.TL:DR Version:Rockstar needs to get it together with banning hackers, and until then, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME if you plan on playing online or it will be miserable for you."

But luckily, as with any good game, community created content has been available to spice up the experience and to even re-invent the game where possible. For as long as I've played GTA games, I remember using mods to liven up the experience. With Take Two Interactive taking its first step to ban mods from GTA V, it has become clear to me a new era has started within their business where greed has taken over. Which is quite tragic when you know they're already making hundreds of millions of dollars on the GTA cash cow.I, along with many others, am of opinion that single player modding and online micro-transactions can happily co-exist, and that I can no longer support this game with a publisher that just flips the bird to its community."

[12/11/2016]: Trainer Users are still there, Rockstar still does nothing about them but put up bans they can avoid, and get ban happy to third party apps, the wheels keep turning, don't bother buying this game on PC for online, it's a terrible Idea.- Used a memory optimization program (CleanMem, Razor Cortex, etcetera)- Attempting to force AA or other graphical effects through your drivers- Using a Field of View mod (They actually lied about saying this is acceptable)- Having any file in the GTA folder that was not shipped with the game (Literally anything)- Leftover log files from singleplayer mods- Discord when it hooks into a game via an Overlay can get you banned[Trainers don't get banned since they hide the way they hook into the game.](Fun little videos)-------------------------------------------------------------------A bit over year later Rockstar finally updates their game enough to consider that it has a bit of Anti-Cheat now to ban people at a faster rate and prevent cheats from the start and is working quite well considering many haven't seen many script users, I've seen at least 2 but it has been very spaced out and only briefly using it very blatantly, it has helped it out a lot to not have said issues persist as strong as they used to and I can recommend it, but I won't take down this review since it took over a year to lock-down the issues and still not have a statement on it, or anything else to say why it took so long, the game is harder to mod for the better and the worst because of their implementations, modding the game will trigger the anti-cheat they are using and ban the user, so if you have any interest in modding and online you can only pick between the two and stick with it, otherwise your SOL.As a final note I would recommend picking the game up for 30 Dollars, or Less, it's a fun game and it's a little less toxic with the removal of rampant use of mod menus and general scripts, at full price I can't recommend it if your interested in online, it's toxic as any game would be with such free reign, but if you enjoy being aggressive towards other players then it's fine and full price is acceptable, SP is still as good as ever but MP is still brought down a bit with the player base being really trigger happy and aggressive to ♥♥♥♥ every ones♥♥♥♥♥♥up whether they are interested, or not.-------------------------------------------------------------------Don't get the game for Online, Until Rockstar adds some sort of Anti-Cheat, The Online Portion is absolutely ruined.If your looking for a open world game with an interesting SINGLE Player Story, Or Private Multiplayer with friends, Then this is for you, But if your looking for some drop in and have some open world fun with 30 players, Expect to be abruptly blown up, Gain Millions in cash, Lose said millions in cash, Gain guns you never bought, Lose said guns you never bought, And then have your car deleted all from users playing with trainers.Rockstar Cares about your cash, Not your experience in the game, Dont buy it for half the game, Buy it for the full game when they actually make half the game playable.-------------------------------------------------------------------There's already a work around with trainers, Unknown if their system is working forward to banning them after a bit.Nothing has exceptionally changed for the better, Recent Patch Notes say that they have updated and tweaked their anti-cheat measures, Ussually trainers would be up and running in a few hours, So far nothing has come up.Players using scripts and what not can now go invisible and hide themselves from others entirely, Add that onto the ability to launch others into the air at a whim, Or having molitovs explode on them, As well as exploding, the only thing actively being gaurded right now is the money, And that's still being shot out from miniguns, Or simply dropped onto player's heads.To gather information if you wish to report a player, the best option is to find a TV ingame and use spectate to report a player that is invisible, They can still be seen even if their husk isn't visible.The script creators already found an easy workaround around the brief scan, It's stopped all money drops long term because they are monitoring it a bit more heavily, But they can do everything else in between still, I'm still suggesting anyone to really think about getting the game.The issue still persists to this date, But is now raised to where Users of said Trainers are targeting players calling out users and reporting players using trainers to rockstar, They can remove the bans placed against them, They can remove all in-game reports on them, They've ruined Online, I implore you to reconsider at all costs as to buying GTA 5 For online, They have so much power in Online and rockstar is not showing any hint of helping out the common player on GTA besides for giving us cash for the cars/ammo/guns we have lost and saying, ""Sorry for your inconvenience."", Perhaps they've forgotten who makes their games so popular.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------"

But it never came, then they ended up adding shark cards, I thought nothing of it, but then I looked how much these shark cards cost and how little money they give you. The only good thing that ever happened to me in this game was a hacker giving me money so I could atleast experience the online portion until even it was taken away from me. They ended up re-releasing the game on ps4, and then finally ended up putting it on pc too which is where I got it. But still they only show love for online, they've lost what it means to play grand theft auto, and instead are just a cash grab. Now I'm told they're getting rid of mods?

Their reason was that ""OpenIV allows users to create malicious mods that allowe harassment of players and interfere with the GTA Online experience"". OpenIV does not touch online and immediately disables itself if you try. Why are people still supporting Rockstar?Edit: These problems seem to be ocurring less by now, but I'm leaving this review up as a warning to the scummy business practices of Rockstar.-----------------People are being banned for no reason and Rockstar agrees with them, yet they are still refusing to reverse the bans or do anything to help. Using Discord, Fraps, Any third party Framerate counter or any program that adds an overlay to your games will result in you getting banned, and support will not reverse it. Heck, if you buy shark cards and they don't work they won't even refund you for that!Do not support awful business practices like this. Their anti cheat is terrible and their support just wants your money.EDIT: A lot of people seem to be taking this as ""Waaaah! I got banned!"", so let me clear things up. I have not been banned, I uninstalled the game myself as the hard drive space it took was massive and I didn't play it much. For those who don't believe the large amount of people who have been falsely banned, here are a few more reasons why you shouldn't support R*.There is a limitless amount of bugs for Online. Ranging from everyone in your session suddenly leaving the game at once, you being booted for no reason, connections timing out randomly, all of these are punctuated with the worst error screen I have ever seen. Instead of presenting you with a simple ""You have timed out"", the game instead spends much time loading up Single player, puts you into the world, and *then* gives you an error message, with an option to rejoin. Which how ludicrously long the load times in this game are, that's a good 2-5 minutes waiting for an error to appear just so you can start waiting again to get back into the game. It is incredibly easy to fix, but rockstar still haven't because they do not care.There is no server browser. This means that with the endless adversary modes they add, all are dead within a week. The only options you have when in an adversary mode is to invite people of a similar level (which almost never works) and to invite everyone who was in your previous free roam session. If you are playing free roam, would you want to suddenly be pulled into a small mode which likely won't have many players? I thought as much. Thus the modes die off extremely quickly.And finally, the Anticheat is still terrible. You can have people flying around the map, spawning props locking you in place, dropping money bags on everyone (Which in an amusing way, can result in *them* getting banned) and just generally causing havoc. Every ""attempt"" Rockstar has made has resulted in false positives, and an extremely intolerant system towards modders. You remember how much Rockstar said they ""loved"" the PC Audience and their modders? That's amusing considering they're filling the game with dummy code to confuse them, and you will be instabanned if you go anywhere near Online with the slightest hint of a modification to your game files.In all, do not support a developer who does not care about their audience. They release modes (The recent Further adventures in Finance and Felony update is a great case for this) that require either for you to grind an unreasonable amount of money, or buy shark cards to make it all easier. Not to mention the adversary modes they throw out are easy to make and take little to no effort, as again, they'll be dead within a few weeks.You will be better off supporting another company.

251,168.2,Not Recommended," June 16, 2017",34,"1) Rockstar has betrayed its fans and declared that modding their software is in violations of its terms and conditions. The popular modding suite from OpenIV that tens of thousands of GTA players use to run fun mods like LSPDFR, has received a cease and desist letter from Take Two Interactive's legal team. Take Two is the parent company of Rockstar.2) Rockstar has made it mandatory to connect to Rockstar's social club in order to play any aspect of GTA, including single player. Thus, any use of ""illegal"" mods or cheats can result in a ban from using Rockstar's online service, thus, you will no longer be able to play GTAV, even though you paid for it. Rockstar has taken the stance that you no longer own a copy of the software, rather, license the privilege to use its software on the condition that you adhere to every single one of Rockstar's ever changing terms.3) It isn't lost on my that Rockstar has been fighting a seemingly losing battle to stop cheaters in the online game, many of whom are using mods that use OpenIV's plugin. However, TakeTwo Interactive has also gone after another modding community that was creating a private server mod for GTAV that would enable people to play GTAV on private servers with mods and not ruin the GTA Online experience for other players. Instead of meeting the consumer half way and either securing GTA Online better, or supporting private LAN or private servers like most games do, TakeTwo and Rockstar once again show that they are only concerned with corporate profits, and do not wish the players to play GTAV in any other mode or setting unless Take Two can have complete control and profit from it.I will no longer be supporting a mindless corporate machine that wishes to seek legal action against its consumer base for modifying the product to suit one's own needs. I am effectively boycotting Take Two Interactive and Rockstar."

Interesting different differetials - AWD, RWD, FWD with different power distributions like 30% front 70% back and so on. It was a little annoying that there are many rwd cars but non of them can be drifted. After using the handbrake seems like the car goes from 200hp to 50hp. But yea the most interesting part of the game seemed to be the cars for me.Some things are still really unrealistic like killing a npc with a gun what has a silencer, nobody sees or hears it but u r still getting cops on you. So.. messing with the npcs like a silent murderer doesnt really work.GTA online:Hackers and cheaters everywhere, ♥♥♥♥ you up what ever you do.

106,656.6,Not Recommended," October 8, 2017",232,"This was fun for a long time. beautiful game. You can probably see from my profile that I have a lot of hours logged, so I hope it is telling on how much fun I used to have playing this game. I pretty much only played Online, though I heard that the campaign (solo) was great. problem is that it became a game where grinding was more important than enjoying the environment, the vehicles, story, etc. Most of the new vehicles that are being released by these updates- arent available in solo play, so online play is the only way to use them, you can use them in missions, and if you really like them, then shell out millions for them. If you dont have the time to grind and make money, then there is no way you'll get them, and even if you do, everything costs so much that you'll have to do more grinding to get that next overly priced vehicle. Rockstar knows this, and that some people with money will pay to get these things, so they became all about the shark cards. for $100 you would receive $8Mil in in-game cash, and it wouldnt be enough to purchase the two most expensive vehicles in the game. the Bombushka alone is nearly $6Mil, or $64.98 in real cash. the mammoth tula and the Molotok are about the same. you are paying the price of a whole new game for ONE plane that you can store in your $1.5-3Mil hangar, which you barely had money to pay for after buying the dang plane. I am uncertain if they made any changes to purchasing military vehicles, but last i checked, you could not sell them back for some fraction of the original cost, so if you decide later that you don't like the vehicle, you've just wasted a lot of time, and possibly a lot of real cash.I'm tired of doing the same missions over and over to get poor returns, then spending it all on one thing. i just wanted to have fun and not get bored after doing the 20th resupply or cargo theft run for whatever business im operating. Stop giving Rockstar your money and make them do something that isn't all about Rockstar.-----Bottom line, I cannot recommend this game to anyone that doesn't have A LOT of time on their handsEDIT:@Amputator, thanks. page wouldn't load, will try again!no i can't recommend it anymore, it was tons of fun before, but now they arent adding anything new. no new concepts. each of their last additions are the same. spend at least $1mil on a new place. get packages which have a timer bewteen runs, finally get enough to sell, and walk away with maybe another mil after 12 hours of doing the same missions over and over.if this were an RPG, their additions would actually add a variety of content that lasted more than an hour or two. instead, i have to do the same bs for hours to get half-way to purchasing one item. but they know the user base is stupid enough to puchase a shark card and use it to buy a plane worth $65. more than the ♥♥♥♥ing game was to begin with.@Rhyathymia , says the guy who spends too much time playing FO4. ♥♥♥♥♥, that was the worst one by far. you really have no idea what a good RPG is to begin with.online has no RPG basis, that is the solo campaign. smh. online has no decision making, no character development, and no narrative other than a half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥conversations with Ron. the whole plot is making money so you can buy the next expensive car that rockstar inevitably releases that may make you slightly better at doing the same thing you always do, like terrorizing other players.

The servers for online are STILL garbage with no clear indication on when they will improve it. Unfortunately, I had purchased this game twice. The first time I bought it on the playstation and then on PC to see if online would be improved from the console version, but it was definitely not worth it.I enjoyed the singleplayer a little bit, but the story feels more shallow in comparison to what they had in previous iterations like San Andreas and GTA IV.All in all, don't waste your time or your money on a sub-par game from a Triple A publisher."

85,223.0,Not Recommended, January 25,98,"SHARK CARDSEDIT: OK, I wrote the above review when I was really tired thinking nobody would ever see it and I found it funny at the time. However, upon people actually seeing it and criticizing a negative review of the game overall for the sole reason of shark cards, let me provide a comprehensive review of how I feel about GTA V. Skip to the end for a summary, otherwise the review will be split into an introduction, and three main sections detailing each issue I have with the state of this game.Intro: GTA V is a good single player game. There is plenty of things to do, an engaging campaign, and a massive world to explore. My issues with this game come with GTA online. First of all, in my experience, it is very hard to have fun in GTA online unless you or a friend of yours has a significant amount of in-game money. Sure, there are heists that you can do with your friends, and ""fun"" activities in the forms of online lobby tasks, but this becomes bland and repetitive very quickly, more on that later. To get money, people have taken to hacking, and these hackers now populate online lobbies often. The other way of getting money is the purchase of shark cards, with your money. This microtransaction method has always bothered me to an extent, but more so recently.The nature of GTA online is by nature very cutthroat. The game incentivizes you to sabotage other people, which already promotes a toxic community atmosphere. The people that are trying to make money legitimately (through CEO work, Biker Gang businesses, etc. rather than hacking) will often be terrorized by people in the lobby with far superior gear and vehicles. This toxicity in online lobbies has become the norm; sure, from time to time, there will be people that leave you alone but more often there will be people that kill you for no reason. And this isn't the worst part of the people in online lobbies.HACKERS. I haven't played GTA online over the last month, but before that and presumably still now, there were hackers everywhere. In half the online lobbies that I joined, there was at least one blatant hacker there. Some hackers will just spawn money for them and their friends (a practice that is still ""unethical"" and ""wrong"", since it is stealing Rockstar's shark card revenue), which does not affect any other players directly. Others, however, will take pleasure in blowing up everyone in the lobby, their vehicles, and ruining any opportunity for fun. The hackers were one of the main things that drove me away from GTA online; why even play if there are people running around committed to ruining your fun?This brings me to my final and largest issue; the in-game money situation and the ""optional"" microtransactions. Everything in the latest DLC additions is ridiculously expensive; take for example the ‘facilities’ in the new Doomsday Heist DLC. The cheapest configuration costs $1.67 million and the most expensive is $5.74 million. If you were to buy these with shark cards alone, as I’m sure many have, it totals from $30 to $80 of real money. For an in-game bunker that is only one small part of the DLC additions. Some of the cars can cost $40, some of the warstock vehicles up to $90. With or without friends to play with, getting this money without the use of hacks or shark cards is extremely repetitive and relatively slow, and gets boring very quickly. This is my largest issue with the state of this game’s online. Without guns or vehicles, it is very slow to make money, and in my experience, it is very hard to have fun without a vehicle in GTA V online. The only way to get these quickly without using hacks is to spend large amounts of money on shark cards, which always has bothered me. It bothers me more as of late because of how expensive the DLC has become, it seems next to impossible to get any of it without the use of shark cards.In conclusion, the state of GTA online is not a positive one. If you are buying GTA V for the single player, go right ahead; maybe wait for a sale, but that is up to you. But if you are buying GTA for the online? Don’t.Thanks for reading my review"

On about 3/23/18 thousands of accounts were randomly banned. I'm not saying all of them were innocent, but at least a vocal majority certainly are. And as of writing this, (4/5/18) we still haven't gotten any sort of proper response, that isn't some generic copy-paste nonsence.This new system appears to have been targeting cheaters, but happens to label seeming randomly people as cheaters.But you wanna know what will likely come of wiping the progress of some thousand people's charaters? More cheaters. Because, who realisticly is going to come back after a month, having lost some hundreds -in some case thousands- of hours, of legit grinding thinking ""well, let's do that ALL over again.""And don't even get me started on their support policies. If you even MENTION the word ""ban,"" your support ticket is thrown directly into the trash, and given a generic ""bans are triggered by a number of things..."" ""and all bans are final."" Like, they give this anti-cheat so much credit that ""It can do no wrong"" in their eyes. And you're placing a losing bet if you think they will admit any sort of failure on their end.On top of all this, you somehow get a real responce from someone, they can't/won't tell you why you were even banned. This is just plain stupid on many levels. You're just, SUPPOSTED to know what you did wrong and not do it again.This is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Especially when one of the listed reasons for a ban is ""Disrupting play."" That's so incredibly vague, they could ban you for just about anything under that label.If they're banning for minor exploits/glitches, they have a lot longer list than what was banned. I guerentee at least a third of the community has exploited some glitch one time or another. And if that is so, that's some pretty backwards priorities when you STILL can't go a few hours in freeroam without bumping into a cheater.That's all I have to say.

How does one of the highest grossing games of all time get mixed customer reviews on steam despite the PC edition coming out 3 years after the console version? You might be wondering if they care about your custom, or if some decrepit fat cat just wants your money so they can go retire on a mulitmillion $ yacht someplace and not give a damn. Well, I'm not sure I can answer all those concerns, but I'll try my best.->Fan since 1997 (21 years).->Buy pretty much every GTA for full price including pre-ordering. Buy GTA 5 twice, once console, 5 years later PC.->Did not allow me to transfer my console 110 rank character. Ok fine, doesn't make sense, but okay... I roll with it...->They randomly erase legit [no cheat, no glitch, no mod money] PC character (300+ rank, effectively 410+ rank if you add my console character) after 1200 hours of brutally accurate grinding and rare achievement accomplishment (1/500 players) and false ban, NO REASON GIVEN. Meanwhile sessions constantly filled with cheaters at every turn. Real cheaters on forums pointing out they have never been banned...->People who money glitched and accepted Mod money never banned. FACT!->Terribly glitchy and lazy development, recycled missions, interface glitches, game crashes, unstable sessions, infinite loads->Zero customer service and support, pointlessly outsourced to clueless external company that copy and pastes answers where you can communicate with their uneducated, low paid slave goons.->I spent hundreds of hours teaching noobs to play. Literally, 3 minute missions can sometimes take one hour or more due to disconnects and noobs (and pronoobs).-If you don't have many friends online, expect to wait for hours to fill up your game lobby sometimes, and await your impending character erasure.->Never once used passive mode, and cannot remember ever destroying someone's product (why should I?).Legit, honest, pro players are collateral damage. One of my worst gaming experiences in about 3 decades of gaming? A game built for noobs and suckers to spend real money on microtransactions and wreck the missions of good and honest players. But games are not banks to me, they're entertainment and challenge. Oops!But if that wasn't enough. The game will have you scratching your head with waste of time philosophical questions such as: How do you NOT accidentally glitch in a glitchy piece of garbage with cheaters running around every corner?

563,41.9,Not Recommended," December 2, 2016",1,"If this game was split into two Steam hubs for the Single Player and the Multiplayer, the SP would have a 99% positive and the Multiplayer would look like No Man's Sky. It is an excellent single player game, but mimics a trash and cash-grabby freemium game for multiplayer. It seems like Rockstar only sees their players as wallets.The lowest price this game has gone for is $30, so wait until then. When you do, just stick to single player. For a good open world multiplayer experience, head elsewhere.Cons first, pros second.ConsRockstar intentionally designed their online ecosystem to be like a cash-grabby mobile game. You are able to own property, vehicles, etc. However, you have to earn currency by playing similar grindy missions/heists or competitions. This seems great in concept, but the numbers are intentionally designed to make you feel like it would be easier to just ""buy"" the in-game currency with real money. Also, if you come from the single player, you get much less cash in general, so you are getting less money than you are ""used to"", which contributes to the aforementioned psychological pressure. Yes, you can theoretically get it all with time spent in-game, but this is similar to the League of Legends IP model in which the time spent per money acquired is so low that you are constantly pressured to just spend the real money. This sort of constant pressure does not make for an enjoyable gaming experience.There are superfluous accounts of Rockstar refusing to appeal any bans for online play. The ban-worthy offenses include but are not limited to: using any overlays, recording software, voice chat software such as Discord, etc etc. Oh, and make sure to hell that you don't EVER mod the single player, because that'll get you banned in multiplayer too! (maybe this is why Bethesda doesn't do multiplayer?)Let's also not mention that some hackers can appear in your public games (because you can't do these grindy missions by yourself) and just spawn money over your head. You can go jump through a bunch of hoops to try to get rid of that ""hacked"" cash, but even the fact that this is possible is ludicrous.How on earth are you supposed to prepare so much for all of these detrimental nuances? No one should have to be this scared and pensive to just play multiplayer normally, but it primarily exists as a cash grab to support the ""free"" DLC that Rockstar releases (which you need to acquire with in-game currency, of course).If you get banned, you will get ignored. Rockstar already made their money off of you, so who cares.Rockstar also has a history of greed by refusing to put the game on sale during Steam sales. They instead will lump the game at the reduced price and throw the ""Shark cash"" in with the, so it is tough to find it below 60 bucks. You probably won't want to play multiplayer anyway.This is one of THE best single player games I've ever played. The over-world has an astounding amount of detail and nuance, the content is ample, the characters and story are interesting, and a lot of the mechanics are fun to use. The story is surprisingly deep and is on par with a gang/mafia style movie. One of the things that Rockstar has understood about GTA is that making the driving/traversing around the world fun makes everything else fall into place, and this game is the best in the series at it. Sometimes you just want to drive around and go sight-seeing, which is extremely fun.As a PC port, it exceeds expectations. This game is proof that it is always worth it to wait for a PC port (most recent example being Final Fantasy XV), as long as the developer makes sure to do it well. Uncapped framerate, resolutions, lots of options for optimization, etc. The rendering distance is great, and it's very easy to see most of the distinct features of a landscape at a long distance.One of my main complaints is that hitting a high vehicle speed can make the rendering suffer a bit, but it's not a big deal."

183,47.3,Not Recommended," June 17, 2017",25,"It says a lot about Take Two when having already earned $2.3 billion since launch they are still willing to go after the modding community, which at best puts a insignificant dent in their revenue, if not actually earning them more sales from people who are enthusiastic to try out the variety of mods available.Let's not forget that this isn't a first. Not long ago people were getting bans left and right for using mods in singleplayer which was later corrected, but still left a bad taste for those who were affected.Although the developers of OpenIV aren't willing to proceed to court, which is completely understandable considering the costs and time it would take to do so, I'm happy to see that more than 23k people have already expressed their opinions here, and more through petitions.Will this help? Probably. Probably not. It's possible that Take Two will backpedal, but that doesn't seem to be something they would be interested in, seeing as how directly threatening the developers of OpenIV was their first go-to option.Coming from a background of more than 4 years invested in SA:MP and MTA, which are the reasons GTA San Andreas still has an active player base, it's a sad state of affairs that the GTA franchise has come to. It's probable that with GTA Online being as profitable as it is, R* may not even consider future additions to the franchise. Why would they?Negative steam reviews and bad publicity aside, I encourage people to boycott Take Two. Don't give them a reason to continue as they are.

107,78.9,Not Recommended," June 11, 2015",566,"Rockstar just lost a lot of respect from a large part of it's playerbase.(UK Customer) I paid £39.99 on release, current standalone price is £51.98 but a -25% discount makes it £38.98. This kind of business practice is actually against ASA regulations, raising the price of a game and then putting it on sale to make it look like it's actually reduced is not considered a fair marketing strategy in the UK.With regards to the bundle with ""Great White Shark Cash Card"" at the same price of £38.98, it's a move that isn't really on the side of the consumer or in the spirit of past steam sales. It has only been out for 2 months on PC so I don't think anyone was hoping for a big discount but putting it in a bundle and slapping a -25% discount on it really means the consumer isn't saving at all. They're getting some free in-game money which might be nice for some people but I think if most wanted the game + In-game money bundle they'd have prepurchased it when the in-game money was also free.I hope people don't just see the -25% discount and think they're getting a great deal by saving 25%, beacuse they're really not. You're either getting some free in-game money or - even worse - nothing at all with the standalone discount. GTA V is a great game but if you were looking to save on it you won't be in this current steam sale.Rockstar, please treat your customers with more respect."

So you're like, okay, fair enough. Well you spent about 20 million over what you had accumulated yourself (about 30 mil) before they took the money away. At no point do they mention that they can just reach right in whenever they want after the fact and continue removing GTA$. Months pass, and some new DLC is coming out. They gotta make sure they drive up them shark card sales. I log on... 'Your account has been debited - 'x' amount', and convieniently enough, they drain my account empty again. After just spending the past month working up enough cash to get a head start on the DLC content, they swipe it away. I contact R* support, and they pretty much tell me what I had initially feared. They can, at any point in time, regardless of how much time passes, continuesly remove cash from my account to make up for the illigitimate, but not requested, GTA$ that was placed into my account against my own free will.I have been playing GTA since top down on the PS1.

We start off with a Bank Heist and the main characters are immediately given out as heartless bad guys. I know GTA is about being bad, but hear me out. In 4 I cared about Niko, he was an immigrant coming to America, trying to start fresh, start new, get his life going, live the dream. He has a cousin already established, and that cousin helps him grow. We feel attached to Niko, we care about Roman, the story has it's ups and downs, it's a classic story of trying to do the right thing. Now GTA V, a bunch of heartless thieves with shallow back stories and no depth to them. Why should I care about some random hood gangster, why would I care about a guy who's more than well off and has a comfy home life, why would I care about a batshit insane trailer trash guy? I can't feel for these characters, everything bad that happens to them is because they deserved it.

Not only does mean that the game isn't really on a discount, it also means that you probably won't be able to refund it in case something goes wrong or if you change your mind because of the unrefundable micro transaction along with it. I preorded this game before it came out, but for players who do not currently own it and are considering it, I would probably wait until this is over. Hopefully Rockstar will see how angry the Steam community is about this and sort it out. Until then, I would suggest waiting.

I do hope that these reviews will serve as a warning to those who are thinking of giving the support of their wallet to a company who cares little for what their player base thinks.The single player game is pretty decent, And most people buying this would be satisfied by just purchasing the game for that mode. However, modding adds to that experience and allows the community to turn an amazing game into something even better.The online mode for this game is not anything to write home about. I tried to play it off and on and could never get into it. However, The modding community that was impacted was not one that was even touching the online play. All I can see by Take-Two shutting down the modding community on the single player mode is they are trying to shine the s*** on their multiplayer experience and suck as much money out of it as they can.Think twice before buying games coming from Take-Two and supporting their choices in hurting player's experience for the sake stearing their players to pay them for a crummy version of what the community can do better."

I even got banned for litterally just lagging at one point, and I am now perm banned for money exploits (Ban was fair, perm wasn't).That however does not change GTA V being an excellent game, one of the best ever made in fact. The Online is an extra, and is not and should not be the main focus of the game. The world R* have created, combined with the excellent shooting, driving, and just general gameplay make it an incredible experience. The story is weak, esspecially compared to GTA San Andreas, however that doesn't change how incredible the experience is.Don't let the bad reviews made you think the game isn't good, it's just people justifiably annoyed about the poor online experience."

And it's Grand Theft Auto: Online that I do not recommend.Beyond the 55 or so hours we got out of the singleplayer my playtime has, for the most part, been in secluded servers with my spouse and our friends, as we cannot stand the public in the this game - and if you have a group of people to roam the map with without having to worry about the rudeness that plagues this game - it can be fun. However, that is not enough to recommend it. At this point I play because I already own it; I would not purchase this again.(Conspiracy Time: I suspect R* is directly lying to customers saying they aren't releasing Red Dead Redemption 2 on PC in the hopes that you'll run out and buy it on console and then later when they release it on PC you'll buy it again.

It was quite clear thatconsole users rack up more money and that is exactely why Rockstar decided to wait 1,5 years for the PC release.This company doesn't care about the players anymore.For example: GTA Online is becoming a disaster. The modders totally ruin the game. You can find a hacker in every single session you join. Before, it was a bit better. Now, due to the absence of any anti-cheat, the modders just roam the map and decide to ruin everyone's game experience. Rockstar doesn't seem to care at all.Don't get me started on the loading times. Joining or hosting a mission/heist may take up to 10 minutes. Leaving the game takes time, getting into the game takes even more time. Sometimes the game just fails to connect to Online and puts you automatically into single player, which is ridiculous and takes more time. They should've really made something like SA-MP was - offer independent servers to be rented out, so that people can choose, which gamemode to play.Well, You may check my game hours and say that I am full of crap. I bought this game for Online. I tolerated the loading times and the little-to-none hackers in the beginning of the PC release. Now, I have understood that Online is over-hyped and quite boring, plus, with hackers, it is impossible to enjoy freemode, as I constantly have to put on Passive Mode, to prevent getting killed instantly by an atomic bomb or whatever hacks these guys have.If you really like GTA francise, buy the game after the Summer Sale, as Rockstar decided to grab even more money, before they leave this game. If you don't want to cope with the problems this game currently has, wait for a bit. Maybe in 3 months, they have put a anti-cheat system into Online and fixed the loading times. Maybe."

61,82.5,Not Recommended," June 15, 2017",26,"Take-Two, I really hope you do what is right and stop the madness. Your plans for GTAO have spoiled the gaming community on PC way more than OpenIV ever did and your greedy money hungry ways will not be tolerated by a mass of people who you expect to bend down to your will. By your lack of Single Player support you gave people the only option to go into modding and now we have been stripped away from the right just to buy Shark Cards because your precious online mode is ""infested with modders"" and people have to slave away if they choose not to cough up $100 more on your microtransactions. I went on GTAO earlier and even though the content was fairly priced for someone who had decent money by cheating the game, you leave people to work hard for barely any reward just to make a quick buck. I don't even know if I want Red Dead on PS4 now because you already comfirmed microtransactions for the online mode and I doubt any Single Player DLC will be made because the sheep you cater too will buy the game sadly. If you all reading my review want some advice, I would look into Wild West Online as a good replacement game for RDR. There is no singleplayer or modding but to be honest it seems like the developers for that game have a much more bigger appreciation for the players that buy the game and support them. Hell you can even pre-order their game for like $30 bucks and if you don't like it, you can get your money back before the Alpha ends. I really wish I hadn't bought this game months and even years ago. Thanks Take Two, now ♥♥♥♥ off."

They keep giving us new ways to get overpowered cars but that cost around 25 euros to start working on. There haven't been ANY new heists added to the game and the new cool stuff is only costing more and more.I simpely don't enjoy this game anymore and I doubt most people do anymore. Heists are repetitive, missions are straight up boring and a player who has this overpowered paid (or hacked in) content will simpely dominate a server.Don't buy this game, if you want a good single player experience, play the old GTA games.

380,618.3,Not Recommended," May 9, 2016",392,"I feel I can only write a review for GTA Online, as Grand theft Auto V has been left in the dust since it launched on PC, All of Rockstar's attention goes into GTA Online now. Buying GTA V is basically just a means of distribution for the Online component.I'm level 99 or something like that, I feel I've played the game long enough to have a solid opinion on it, so let's begin.- Base game hasn't recieved an update since the first weeks of launch, they don't even port Online cars to it anymore. And they have been actively taking steps to prevent people from spawning online cars in singleplayer. Looks like they don't want you trying something before you spend half a million GTAbucks on it only to find you don't like it.- Very few of the updates have added any genuine features or changes, most of the time it's the usual combonation of a new vehicle or two, a gun that no one wants, like the antique pistol for example, and some tacky clothing options. For an online game that's technically been going for 3 years, there's been very little innovation.- The whole point of the game is to make money so that you can buy toys, and once you've got everything you want, and once you get bored of the missions, adversary modes and races, and get tired of screwing around in freemode, the game becomes pointless, just a never ending quest to buy more and more overpriced cars and clothing for no better reason than to promote your internet ego, and then realize that everyone else in the game is driving Chrome Adders and sitting on golden Yachts- Rockstar doesn't think when it comes to implementing game features, the bad sport system is horribly abused. More often than not I find myself getting ""bad sport points"" for doing nothing else but defending myself against an Armoured Kuruma full of raging teenagers who are killing everyone on sight. Do that enough and all of a sudden you're broke, and forced to play in a lobby full of dunce hatted griefers and cheaters... not that there's any difference between the dunce lobbies and the normal ones, and on the topic of cheating- The cheating is just insane. it's out of control, Rockstar has lost whatever grip they have on this game, and usually it's not someone cheating in a competitive mode or a co-op mission, more often than not it's just straight out griefing. Getting C130s dropped on you, cars exploding for no reason, having a gang of stripper NPCs with miniguns spawned on you. And then you've also got people who spawn moneybags on others, which completely removes any reason for playing legitimately because Rockstar rarely bans, punishes or otherwise goes after anyone who gets hacked money, just the one who spawned it. They slap cheaters on the wrist, often using a strike system, the first 2 or 3 times you're caught, you get banned for a week or two. It should be permanent. There is no excuse for the amount of hacking that goes on in a game of this size- Free roam is a toxic swamp of internet tough guys, racists, griefers, hackers, tryhards, screamers and squeakers. Freeroam was supposed to be the place where you get to show off, and play with all the things you earned during your missions, and you're extremley hard pressed to find a lobby that isn't full of hackers, Raging griefers with tanks, or one with a blood raging argument going on over voice/chat.GTA Online is like one of the seven circles of hell, it's a circle of hell reserved for the morons and half-wits who get off to a toxic, unforgiving and completeley malicious enviornment.It's a shame, because GTA V isn't that bad of a game, I think GTA IV was ahead of it's time, and I still enjoy it even though it doesn't run too well anymore for some reason. but GTA V has largely been forgotten since it first launched, because in this industry, if an action game isn't an online game, it's irrelevant.GTA V: An impressive technical achievement, hit some nails on the head, missed some others compared to it's predecessors.GTA Online: A toxic pisshole that should be avoided at all costs."

That is, players that don't cheat or engage in illegal activities are being banned for one month without a specific reason. No one is really certain on what triggers this ban, some say Discord, Xplit, OBS and even Windows 10 Recording might be the culprit. As if that was not enough the worst part is the response from Rockstar, after the ban and you try to open a ticket to resolve the issue, they have already placed an automated response denying any form of contest. Like DONT EVEN TRY, NO ONE IS EVER GOING TO READ YOUR CLAIM.This is completely ridiculous and a shame, and probably an unethical consumer stance. The game is really amazing and GTA Online is getting better content every month, unfortunately the customer service and the anti-cheating is a big stain on Rockstar’s track record...If you buy this game now, you are running a big risk on getting a ban out of blue, and not being able to play it online.

(I forget how many neon signs I found with transmisogynistic slurs on them, but I know theres a few, which is a few too many.) So, yeah, you know. It's GTA, as per usual. Offensive just to be offensive, without any actual social commentary.If you ignore every other line of dialogue and 75% of the text, you'll find a fun game. If you can't tune out garbage writing and bad characterization, you'll find out why these people are writing puns for shop signs and too-often repeated lines for npcs in video games instead of working on their third internationally acclaimed novel.I really don't know if I do or do not recommend this game, to be honest. I'd like a ""this sure is a video game that exists and some people might like"" option, but I guess I'll have to settle for a yes or no.Yes, if you intend to play both single player and online, for at least 200 hours. Or, if you have friends to play it with, who also want to play online for at least 200 hours.But, if you want to play through the story, just rent it on a console or pirate it, honestly. If you could play gta online without paying full price for the game, I'd recommend you do that, because $60 for a game that is, in essence, that older guy on the back of a school bus, pretending to be cool and telling bad jokes to twelve year olds because they're the only ones who'll laugh?

This is an incredibly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ business practice and a balatant attempt to move players into the micro-transaction-ridden GTA:Online.The second reason why i care (this might get a bit off topic so I'll keep it short), is that Take-Two recently bought Kerbal Space Program, a game I adore, and also a game that heavily relies on the modding community.

The whole online infrastucture is so frikkin bad that it sucks any possible fun you could have in the game right out of you. And still up today R* keeps releasing new pixel junk updates on the same piece of crap online p2p infrastructure to milk the consumers even more... with no intention at all to really improve the whole online experience.Online experience:Start the game. Get a 2 minute loading screen. Choose online mode. Get a 2 minute loading screen. You are logged into a session without any other players. Okay fine, lets do a quick race then against some players. Choose quick race. 2 minute loading screen.'No active race could be found'. Only options in the menu you have now is 'host a race' or 'join a random mission'. Choose host a race. .... loading screen. You are dropped in a random race alone. Set 'auto invite' active. wait 10 minutes and still nobody to race with. You escape out of the session and go back to freeroam. 2 minute loading screen. Okay back at freeroam, check for other players. Nope, you are again in a session alone. So lets do the 'random race' again. ... and you get where I am going at. You get the same frikking loading screen crap and again the terrible barely functioning p2p matchmaking bull crap. Imagine doing this for 10 hours, imagine doing this for a 100 or a 1000 hours. And in the mean time R* tries to get you to buy sharkcards ,because they made all the cars etc intentionally expensive... and then you have to grind for ingame money in this piece of crap online infrastructure. What a joke!Story mode: Really cool, love it! even more a shame that R* abandoned story mode completely and went for online mode cash grab scheme.R*, one of the biggest sell out companies of the last years.And pls note: I play GTAV on a good gaming rig and with a 200MB fibrewire connection."

In addition to being suspended, all GTA Online characters, progress and inventory on PC will be reset.""Later I found out people are getting banned because they were using some softwares like Discord, Teamspeak, BandicamFraps, OBS, XSplit.I was using Discord to chat with friends and was recording the game with Xsplit, so I guess this was the reason for the ban.Then I opened a ticket to explain the situation and thought that everything was going to be ok, but...I got an automated message that said: ""All GTA Online suspension and banning decisions are final and may not be appealed."" and my ticket was closed.Nice customer service. 10/10Thanks Rockstar.=/"

They're non-refundable because they go straight to Rockstar's service.It took them days to decide to abuse and circumvent Valve's refund service.

Massive budget, massive open-world, massive replay-ability, and massively terrible devs/PR.Singleplayer is fun and probably worth buying all on its own, although chances are the real reason you're looking at this game is for GTA Online. Do not buy this game solely for the online play!In-game currency is unreliable and disappears at random, bans are handed out to innocent players while game-ruining hackers run rampant, the servers still feel like a day-one release with extremely long loading screens, Rockstar has some of the worst customer support ever, and they use scummy business practices like claiming the game is on sale shortly after artificially inflating the price.GTA: Online is a whole new format of Pay2Win. Even moderately decent guns and vehicles are reserved for people who hack or use their mother's credit card to buy in-game currency. To achieve anything legit without spending a fortune, you'll have to waste enough hours grinding repetitive races and linear heists to make a MMO player squeamish.I've had tons of fun playing with friends, and the single-player experience is one of the best I've ever seen, just know what you're getting into before handing your money over to these scumbags.For the record, I'm not salty over a ban or anything. I've had innocent friends get banned, unpleasant run-ins with Rockstar support, and one instance where all of my in-game money vanished without a trace, but this review isn't the result of anything recent or sudden.

18,270.6,Not Recommended," May 19, 2015",199,"The single player game is rather good, but the online game is just unplayable.1. Countless bugs. When you do a heist there is about a 50% chance that you cannot finish it because of a bug. I am not even kidding. That means if you spend 2 hours on a heist, you are only actually playing the real game for 1 hour, as most of these bugs require a restart of the game.2. Crashes. Random crashes occur all the time. Not only that, but some crashes are so terrible that it requires you to reinstall the game. One friend of mine has reinstalled the game more than 10 times now, I am yet again not kidding. More than 10 times he needed to download the entire game again, which is about 60gb each time.3. Glitches. The only thing in the online game that is important is money. You can buy money from the store of the game, but that is never needed. There are multiple glitches and hacks which can make you a millionaire from doing nothing. That is destroying the gameplay a lot, and the programming level of this game to make these hacks possible is just terribly low (I am a programmer myself, and I am shocked that Rockstar Games managed to do this).4. Online in a random game is just terrible gameplay. If you are in a car (which you most likely are), people will just one hit you with an RPG or a Homing Launcher. These players then have to pay a fine for your car if it was insured, which it most likely is. That means that they have to pay for the missile shot ($1500) and then the car (~$6000), but they do not care and think that they have ""won"" the battle, even if they payed for it.This either means that people are just not smart enough in this game to understand that what they do actually makes them lose a lot of money, or that those players are using the glitches to have unlimited money, and can therefore just waste money to win in PvP. That means that money is much greater than skill in this game.5. Heists. Apart from all the bugs, finding people to go to a heist with is just horrible. Most people can't even speak or type in english. This makes it impossible to finish a heist with random people. You have to use external websites to find a heist team, and even then its hard to find people that can actually finish a heist (about 5% chance to win a heist each try, hours and hours doing the same thing over and over).Even if you finish all heists in a row, or without dying at all, there are bugs that removes the additional money given for achievements. This means that you can spend around 10 hours doing an achievement, and then when you should get $10 000 000 for it, you just get nothing.I always wanted to work at Rockstar Games, but now I feel that I have nothing to learn from them. How can they fail so miserably making a game that works with that much money?"

145,"1,400.8",Not Recommended," June 18, 2017",32,"What can I say? Is GTAV a good game? No. Sadly it really isnt. I got it on XBox on release and after playing though the story and thinking back, all the characters are not believable, the physics are a step back from just a game before, and they take a beloved character from an older game and kill him off in the first 5 seconds with no explination. I mean off to a really bad start already..So there I was playing through the story and I hear about them making a version for the PC. Not a crappy port like GTA4 was but a real honest GTAV for PC. Since I never had enough interests in playing for Live I got my chance to experience online.. boy was that a mistake. Online (at least in its current and forseeable form) is just a lazy cobbled together excuse for micropayments. It is a grindfest of gringing to grind.. and for what? A car with the same stats as one you already have, just looks slightly different, and only 2 Million more than the one you already have. For what end you ask? Shark Cards. Buy in game money with real money.They even recently took the level gap and destroyed any chance for a new player to be able to do anything to older players. They were smart enough to keep the railgun out of multiplayer but now you can buy exploding 9mm bullets that 1 hit kill even cars. Way to take a step in the wrong direction there..So aside from that there are some things I like about it. Most people hate, and wish you could sell, the yachts, but I really like mine.. the down side is the lack of any decent customization.. I can't select the better helicopter on my more expensive yacht because it isn't a costimizable option.. well there is 20 mil down the drain..I think what really hits the hardest with online is the lack of keeping any promises. Before GTAV hit the PC (or just as or whatever) they released the heists update. This was chained missions that needed set ups and big heists with big booms and lots of action! Promises of updates months after to add new amazing heists and even a way to submit a player created one to be featured and added. That was over 2 years ago and still not even a touch up on the update.. Really, what does R* do with the money they make? It is obvious they don't put it into making their players happy..So asking me if I would recommend this game or not is a simple answer, ♥♥♥♥ no. When I got this on PC it was knowing that SAMP would be reborn somehow. It took a couple of years to even get started with all the flack and lawsuits coming from Take Two.. and now they are saying we can't mod our own game? We buy the rights to the code to do with what we please. We are not renting the code from you, and we are not standing around while you bully us. You want to EULA people out of your official online game mode, fine, it is garbage anyways, but you can't keep people from playing a game they way they want.~~~~TL:DR~~~~Fix almost everything, but is a really good game for a really bad one.Lets hope someone takes Take Two to the Supreme Court so we can be done with this ""buying a game isn't renting it from the devs"" BS. We will all thank Take Two for ending this stupid debate once and for all."

Instead of keeping it at that price, they decided they could con buyers by raising the base game's price back to normal and instead add a shark card to make it appear as if the game was still on sale, which, as countless others have stated, is shady business.

Shops have same products as it was in 2012. Mods can solve this problem...but since they banned, then single right now is useless.2.Longest loading screen. You can make some coffee and watch youtube and you still will be on loading screen.3.Prices on cars high as hell. You need to play one week just to buy one good car and all your live to buy everything.4.Game really hate players who likes to play alone or have not much time for playing. So if you like to play alone then you can forget about GTA5Online and specially about CEO or MC.5.Community looks like all trolls or kids, so they will kill your game in heists and any team-based missions. And after they will kill you.6.Horrible hackers. But maybe all will be good right now, since Rockstar banned mod programs if not, then I dont know for what they banned mods.7.CEO or MC is boring, same and useless, since community do not care about money, they like blow up everything. That means what you need to find session where 4 or 6 players, and this is really hard to do.8.Why only 2 characters?9.I do not know how others, but I do not feel difference between cars of same type after upgrade.Also I can't understand why GTAO do not have peacefull missions, like truck simulator delivery or taxi. Or even real business simulator with shops, corporations and etc.Also I cant understand why I can't play for police with their own special weapons, cars, investigations, missions and etc. Plus in game will be some kind of two big clans, who will be fight for peace or anarchy.I cant understand why game have 3(!) big gangs and NEVER use it. Yes, you can do Lamar's missions, but why not to make gang war for low leveled players for territory? Why not add ""shop protection""? So all shops on this territory will be pay to a gang money for it and gang can have special weapons while it.Where is sick serial killers mode? You have so many NPC and police, but only what you can do it's kill someone then run from police. Why not to make hunt on some NPC or even players with stealth?CEO and MC mostly boring, because only what you can do is take something to your base and then sell. It's boring and not cool and mostly waste of time, because of other players. Plus calls of managers really annoying. So why not take real crime? Why CEO can't support other CEO or make a war? Why they can't buy police to make a problem for others or support? Why they cant make corruption in game, so laws can be changing. For example, to make alcohol underlaw, so CEO, which sells it can have problems with cops, but prices on alcohol will be high. And etc.It was really cool game, but right now GTA looks like a common boring MMO. And this is sad."

Its a beautifully made racket that will shaft you with a wooden stake and leave you to die in the woods for no reason and with less than no remorse.Any cost is exorbident for a game in which every month you own it, you roll a dice to determine if half of the content will be permanently removed from you.If you do buy the game, you will enjoy it for a time, there is some interesting gameplay I admit. However, after a short time the first little prod will occur. It might be some money getting removed from you for little to no reason. This might happen a few times over the next few months but you will probably get by and keep enjoying yourself.The kicker is that the better you get, the more likely you are to get banned. This is not hyperbole, if you make too much money (making money I should remind you is the main point of the game) the server will be suspicious that you hacked it in, even if it is a poultry sum compared to how much you would actually have if you were actually spitting in the face of the spirit of the game.The second way GTA Online punishes you for being competent is this; anyone can report you at any time for hacking. This is especially a problem if you build up enough muscle memory to perform such impossible feats as actually F*cking shooting a couple of people without tripping over your shoelaces into a sewer.I played GTA Online for no less than 800 hours, I was rank 182 and owned most everything there was to own. In my hubris of competence, I was allways in danger, my bank account was 'corrected' several times. A few of these were due to money being deposited in my account without my consent by ACTUAL modders. I will admit I wasn't exactly angered by this at first because I assumed that a company whom could build a game as wide as GTAV were capable of making a semi competent anti cheat system.The problem is this; the aims of the player and the developer are, in this case, directly opposed. Rockstar (great odin forgive me for uttering that filthy name) doesn't want you to have money or be competent because they in their infinite grace have allowed the player to give them real money, (on top of the normal, not insignificant game price) to feel like you are competent.I was lead by the nose into the matrix of lies and adverse goals. I spent hours and hours playing what I thought was a 'game'. It's not a game, or at least it isn't any more. Don't buy this crap, the good memories are not worth the degredation they are subjected too when the rug is finally thrown out from under you."

Quite frankly, as someone who has yet to be banned for legit play like so many others, I want R* to tell us their plan, one way or another. If it's firmly that all bans are final and cannot be appealed, then fine. But right now half the people appealing are being told this while the other half are being told that R* are looking into the ban wave. It's infuriating and is the worst customer support since EA put up their infamous Reddit comment about wanting their insane progression system to give a sense of reward and accomplishment. A third of your playerbase is being wiped out, probably due to erroneous code, and yet you act like you don't care, giving mixed signals and avoiding any public acknowledgement of the ♥♥♥♥ up.

282,"1,512.5",Not Recommended," April 11, 2017",283,"The game is both singleplayer and multiplayer, so I'll rate the product with both in consideration with the current asking price. TL;DR included at bottom.The story in singleplayer is great, but you're only getting half of a product that is now three years, six months old if that is all you buy the game for. The story has not been touched since release and as game value is set to depreciate as newer and better engines and systems come out, it's not worth what it currently costs. Compare it to buying a vehicle, and how it's value depreciates as the technology involved slowly moves from state of the art to not so much.It's not obsolete, but it's not new or fresh enough to be 'new game value' based on singleplayer alone.Multiplayer can be great, and with the right group of people, it usually is. The online activities are fun, the mission creator is fun & open-world sessions can also be fun- But generally only if you're playing with close friends and avoiding random stranger-dangers.Multiplayer is built around microtransactions, with any and all new DLC requiring a disgusting grind of the same 5 heists, the same well-paying contact missions and the seldom double GTA$+RP events. I mean disgusting as in they purposely make the grind unreasonable to better entice you, the player, to keep giving this multi-billion dollar company more and more of your hard earned money. That's a good business model, a really good one. It's where you sell a game, and then continue selling more and more of the game.But wait, there's more!Nevermind the grind, if that doesn't bother you. It didn't bother me too much, either, knowing the prices of the cars released cost roughly $40 USD each in GTA$ if you couldn't be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥to spend hundreds of hours grinding it out. If you were fortunate, a player who downloaded a trainer menu (read; a cheat menu) would take a break from looping explosions on every player in the open-world sessions and drop sweet, sweet GTA$ nectar on your thirsty, starving character. Presuming they don't use that menu to crash your game, as they do. It's never a nice feeling, watching your game explode into oblivion before drifting away to the sweet release of death as thousands of clones split from the void that has become your character.But that didn't happen too often. There have been cheaters ever since the game released, from console to PC; though the PC release saw with it the PC potential for modding, which caused a massive influx of cheaters that the game has failed to recover from.My biggest issue with the game is not the fact that items were either paygated or locked behind thousands and thousands of hours, it was not the community, nor was it even the modders themselves.My issue with it was the fact that a multi-billion dollar company that has earned several mass fortunes each week since release cannot be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥to properly implement a system that properly deals with the mod menu issue, and it has seemed they do not care UNLESS their profits (earned by selling GTA$ for real $) is impacted by the modding players dropping free GTA$ on everyone in range. You can look up a slew of the menus and see for yourself that if an option it gives the player affects the cash-flow of Rockstar selling cash for money, it's seen as risky/high chance of being caught.To add onto their stinginess with spending any of their hard earned several billion dollars, I've come to the conclusion that they pay their customer support workers in bottlecaps and breadcrumbs, judging by the few tickets I've sent in.TL;DRSingleplayer good; only worth it if game is on sale for %50 off. ($30 USD or less)Multiplayer bad; Only good in private sessions, or else cheaters will grief you, lock your character, loop you in endless explosions, attach large obnoxious objects to you, become invincible because they do not like PvP in a PvP game, crash/lock your game forcing either a game force-close or a computer restart, or if you're fortunate they will drop money on you. (Before murdering you and your mother)Rockstar is in it for the money, as any good business should be & they are quite successful at it. Their PR is absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥and they do not give a rats♥♥♥♥♥about their clientbase.

Unless you have a question where the answer can also be found on Google (they are happy to explain you things that you can find yourself as well), you will get an automated reply. For what I've seen, a lot of new people (including my friend) are getting banned without a reason from GTA 5 online. The ban period is for one month. Since there was nothing he did wrong, there is a big chance that when he logs in after that month, he will be perma banned. When you address this issue to R*, all they do is give you the same reply over and over again and redirect you to their license and agreement. I would NOT recommend to buy this game, since you can get banned without a reason. R*'s ego about their automated ban system is so huge, starting a discussion with them about it is just a waste of your own time.For all the people that are sitting, ready to reply: ""your friend is a cheater, he got what was coming to him"", just forget it.I would not waste my time writing this review if I knew he hacked/cheated or whatever.Please note that this review is regarding the support R* doensn't offer and GTA 5 online.

However, if you're not willing to ignore all of the games problems, prepare for one of the most grindy and unfair multiplayer modes you will ever play.This game is basically ""The rich get richer and the poor get poorer"". Everything thats not a normal car require a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of money, and each update only add more expensive stuff. This wouldn't be a problem if getting money wasn't such a slow and painful thing to do. You will only be able to earn good cash AFTER you have millions, and even then, it still takes forever.The other problem is Sharkcards. Sharkcards are, in short, pay to win, since they give a bunch of cash instantly. This wouldn't really be too bad, if you wasn't able to buy cars with bullet proof glass, tanks you can call for free after you own it, and jet with a machine gun that shoots explosive shots. Because of this, new players has nothing to defend themselfs with when fighting people with these.Finally, there's the recent drama with Take 2 and modders. Ever since the game launched on PC, modders has been everywhere. Since the game is peer to peer modders basically have admin powers, able to do anything to anyone. Sometimes you would meet one of the nice modders, but they are far and between. Something had to be done, and now Take 2 finally steps in and fix it...And im not just talking about a ban or anything, i mean they will put you in ♥♥♥♥ing court for making mods.As of now, the game is only fun if you're playing with your friends and have most of the things unlocked.

I have been enjoying the game for over 1300 hours, to get a ban with all that progress wiped without providing an explanation is a bit much to bear.

The singleplayer is great like any GTA game, and the multiplayer is a lot of fun if you have friends to play it with. However, because of Rockstar's EXTREMELY shady and dirty business practices regarding the summer sale, I cannot in good faith give a positive review.First off, when the 2015 Summer Sale started, the base game, priced as $60 USD, was removed from the Steam store (but restored later), and some ""bundles"" of GTA V + other things were added. One was GTA V + Max Payne 3 + 200,000 GTA Online cash, another was GTA V + GTA: SA + 200,000 GTA Online cash, and the third was GTA V + 1,000,000 GTA Online cash. All of these bundles are ""priced"" at $80 USD but with a 25% off sticker slapped on, leaving the game at $60 (meanwhile, after being restored, you could buy just GTA V for $60...)A few days into the summer sale, I see GTA V under the ""Top Sellers"" listings, priced at $20 (33% off of $30). I mouse over the listing, and it definitely says it is GTA V. I then go to the store page, and lo and behold Rockstar placed a ""bundle"" of GTA ONLINE IN GAME CASH CARDS AT THE TOP OF THE STORE PAGE, CAUSING STEAM TO DISPLAY THE PRICE OF THE GAME TO BE $20, A COMPLETE ♥♥♥♥ING FLAT OUT LIE.Go ♥♥♥♥ yourselves Rockstar, I will not support these business practices (especially on a game that is arguable 2 years old at the time of this writing), and I ask everyone willing to listen to not support such business practices either.EDIT: Additionally, to my knowledge, because of how Steam's refund work, you CANNOT refund a game if you purchased ""consumable dlc"" such as in game money. So, if you bought one of the bundles of GTA V + Shark Card, you most likely cannot refund the game."

57,14.2,Not Recommended," February 18, 2017",379,"So there I was at 12am in the morning. I remember the great times I've had on console, so I buy GTA V for $30. It takes me four hours to download the massive 70gb game. I start GTA Online and start to drive around in a car and terrorize the civilians. After an hour of gameplay I decide to go to sleep.When I wake up I see an email from Rockstar. ""Rockstar Games Account Suspension and Character Reset Notification"" (which was an email sent by them 50mins after i stopped playing). I remember looking at the reviews about the game and seeing people complain that they've been mysteriously banned for no reason.So I think about the situation. I just bought the game, I just gave these people my money, I played for maybe a little more than an hour of GTA Online, AND NOW IM BANNED.Have I ever exploited the game with any malicious programs? NO I LITERALLY JUST BOUGHT THE GAME FOR $30 ON MY MAIN ACCOUNT (WHICH IS CLEAN).Also to make it just all that much better, these people don't give you any information as to why you were banned, they just tell you that you have violated their rules and tell you how long you're banned for.So in the Rockstar support pages it says that 3rd party applications don't cause bans in GTA Online. Yea right.SO WHAT COULD IT BE?! Could it be that I said one thing in chat which consisted of ""hi guys."" Could it be that I shot civilians and ran from the police? Could it be that I slightly damaged another player's car when I rear-ended it? Nope, i guarantee it isn't any of those things.These people have made billions off of GTA V, so why would they care about my petty $30?DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. YOU ARE GUARANTEED A BAN.These people are too lazy to actually do anything about their rotting reputation.Seriously please do not buy the game guys it seriously makes you feel worthless and degraded. To explain my story hopefully a little better. I bought GTA V for $30 off of Steam because I remember the fun times I had on console. It takes so many hours to download and once it's done I am excited. After the prologue, I head into GTA Online because it's my first experience on pc. In summary, I shot civilians, stole cars, ran from the cops, typical GTA stuff, I didn't PVP.To convice you others that I am a legitimate player, this is my main steam account. This is my first time playing GTA Online on the computer. Why would I waste $30 on my MAIN account just to hack a game? AND why would I spend quite a long time writing this review if I were an actually cheater?I realize that I have actually violated Rockstar's agreements. To play GTA V without being randomly banned you must ensure that your computer doesn't have any programs Rockstar doesn't like? In my case it could've just been cheat engine sitting on my computer, not running. GTA V is a great game, but Rockstar's auto ban system seems faulty to me but that's just my opinion."

3,193.0,Recommended," April 19, 2015",945,"The PC version of GTA V is definitely the best version. We had to wait really long, but the game finally came out in a fantastic state. Rockstar obviously put a lot of time into the PC port/version. I'm usually against pre-ordering games, but I made one exception this year for GTA, and im happy with my decision. I didn't do it for the pre-order bonus (because that was frankly just a disappointing money cheat) , I did it just so I could preload all GB's in time for launch, because the game is ridiculously big.I'm running it at 60-90 fps on 1920x1080 with most things on ""high"", except for the advanced options, which is something you should only use if your running SLI or one really good card. I have a Nvidia gtx 680, which is a few years old now, so im very impressed with how good I can get the game to run. You can also use GeForce experience with GTA, because Nividia released a update for that day before launch.You can play GTA in first or third person mode, and simply change between them on your controller. All cars have different interiors and looks when you are driving in first person. Some textures are a little blurry in first person, but that is something to expect in a game of this size. Fighting, swimming, walking can also be done in first person, so you can just pick what you like the best.If you have an SSD drive that is big enough for this game you should probably use that for GTA, because the loading screens without it is sometimes very long. It's one of the only complains I have with GTA actually. Thankfully thats just when you are loading into story mode or online, because once you are in the big world there is no invisible walls or loading screens.Singleplayer is fun and the 3 main characters are all very well written. You can swap between them in the open world, but also in certain quests. Michael, Trevor and Franklin are very different from eachother which makes the game more interesting then GTA IV's only character, Niko.GTA online is probably what some people will spend a ton of time in. I really just bought it for the single-player experience, but after playing a few hours with my friends I have to say that GTA online is actually really fun. I think the missions will get kind off repetitive in the long run, but to play free-roam with friends will never get old. You also unlock heist in level 12, so that might refresh things even more.I play this game with an xbox controller and it seems like all friends I've talked to is doing the same thing. I strongly recommend it, at least for the driving. You can enable auto-aim on your controller if you think shooting with it is too hard, or you can swap between your keyboard+mouse in combat, and use controller for driving. When you crash your car and get hit the controll vibrates, which I think makes you feel more immersed in the game.I tried the PC controls and I didn't like them at all. For example you have to hit ""Z"" to see how many players are on your server in online mode. You can however rebind all keys on keyboard, mouse, and controller so thats really good, but the default ones on keyboard are not great im afraid.GTA is a fantastic open world game that will no doubt be played for many years to come. I have already played it a lot and I feel like I have much more leveling to do in GTA online, much more to do and explore in singleplayer and many hours of fun with my close friends to come. Singleplayer was all I really needed, so I will just see GTA online as a plus.Well done Rockstar! This is the best PC version you have ever made and I can see that you put a lot of effort, time and love into creating it. Strongly recommend this title to all my friends, whether your the single or multiplayer guy, you will have a ton of fun. This will probably be one of the best games released this year."

We do this, and when were done, I got sent in to a public game for about a minute before I quit the game. Approximately two hours later, I get an email saying my account broke the EULA and terms of service, and I have been suspended for 30 days and my stats reset. Why? I have never once cheated/hacked/modified my game files. If I had to guess, there was probably a hacker in the public game I was in, and I was in just long enough to get dragged along with him. All the horror stories about getting suspended are true, I found out. I tried contacting support and got a copy/paste response about how the ban system works. My friend also contacted them and got a name for me to ask for, even going to the length of calling their support hotline and speaking to a (rather cocky) employee who told him that I would have to call (the entire call was also recorded). It was late at night at the time I heard about it so instead of calling, I sent in another ticket explaining in detail what happened, and mentioned his ticket number and the persons name...same response. Thanks Rockstar for taking over 600 hours of gameplay away from me for no real reason.

I opened a ticket, and got the standard response and it seems like that will be the last thing i heard from the so called ""support"", they also didn't specify what I did wrong. Well dear support, do you even realize what that word means? Because it doesn't seem so, basically you don't deserve to earn any money for your work, because you are technically not working. Yes i realize that in the modern world screwing people over is also considered work, so maybe I am just wrong or too old fashioned.Or maybe I am just wrong because i thought that i was supposed to play the game to earn money. But it seems instead that cheating and griefing is the way to success.But i won't do that, instead i will just refrain from supporting an apparently broken system and will spend my free time in games which are actually thanking me for spending my time with them instead of punishing me for it.But hey, i played well over 250 hours and i had fun in that time, i spent 59 Euro on the game so that amounts to around 0,2 Euro per hour, thats much cheaper than other ways of entertainment. So thank you Rockstar for creating a great game that made me smile many times.But now you can shove it up your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ because it seems that you don't care to treat your customers with respect and that i cant stand, neither in real life nor anywhere else. But hey, 60 gigabyte cost also around 10 Euro these days and that sorta amounts to what you took from me according to the prices of the Shark Cards so it seems to be fair for both of us.So i certainly can't recommend the game in its current state: It was a great experience in the first place and maybe the SP still is, but the MP and therefore the part i have seen just isn't anymore what it used to be. Because reviews are about a games current state and not the historic state there is only one way of putting it: Don't buy this game if you expect a real product with support and customer satisfaction unless useless grind and being treated like a mindless source of cash-grab is what makes you satisfied.Have a nice life everyone and thanks for reading."

But it seems instead that cheating and griefing is the way to success.But i won't do that, instead i will just refrain from supporting an apparently broken system and will spend my free time in games which are actually thanking me for spending my time with them instead of punishing me for it.But hey, i played well over 250 hours and i had fun in that time, i spent 59 Euro on the game so that amounts to around 0,2 Euro per hour, thats much cheaper than other ways of entertainment. So thank you Rockstar for creating a great game that made me smile many times.But now you can shove it up your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ because it seems that you don't care to treat your customers with respect and that i cant stand, neither in real life nor anywhere else. But hey, 60 gigabyte cost also around 10 Euro these days and that sorta amounts to what you took from me according to the prices of the Shark Cards so it seems to be fair for both of us.So i certainly can't recommend the game in its current state: It was a great experience in the first place and maybe the SP still is, but the MP and therefore the part i have seen just isn't anymore what it used to be. Because reviews are about a games current state and not the historic state there is only one way of putting it: Don't buy this game if you expect a real product with support and customer satisfaction unless useless grind and being treated like a mindless source of cash-grab is what makes you satisfied.Have a nice life everyone and thanks for reading."

But after shark cards became a major part of the game, Take Two and Rockstar have been pushing them more and more since. The online currency is so painfully hard to come by and requires countless hours of grinding just to be able to afford a base level super car (That's not including full upgrades which can run you over 50% the original value). Now with the legal removal of mods we see how much the company wants to push their own agenda and forcing the players to obey to their awful system of pay to win. Taking away mods from GTA IV and GTA V royally screws the mod creators, and the people who enjoyed playing with the mods themselves. This isn't nearly as bad as when mods were removed from MInecraft, or when mods became pay to win for skyrim. Fix this soon Take Two or your game, and reputation as being one of the better game publishers, is going down the trash."

I've been banned twice now, the first time for TV remotes in my apartment that were duplicating themselves, and the second time for apparently jumping out of an airplane (This is all me guessing the most plausible cause, since you are given no reason).And as per usual, Rockstar Support refuses to be cooperative, even to the point of completely closing down their phone line to avoid having to speak to any frustrated player. Submitting a support ticket, even with evidence of your innocence, results in the same bot response and an immediate closing of the ticket. You should essentially expect to be banned at some point if you buy this game.UPDATE: After my 30 day ban ended, I decided I would play the game once more just to enjoy it before my inevitable permanent ban. And I was entirely correct, because after the entirety of one evening, I wake up to be perma-banned.Based on when I got the violation notice e-mail, It banned me when I was logging off - when I still had a three star wanted level. Oddly enough, my friend who did the exact same thing (but has no bans on his record) can still play the game. Amusing to say the least."

This is most definitely true.I begin my story, 2 days ago, playing GTA 5 - Online and having some fun with friends. Since I'm slightly impatient I decided to purchase a $10 shark card to assist me in getting me started up. Purchased some weapons, vehicle, upgrades, all that jazz. The next day I start up the game only to see that I have been banned with no explanation as to why I have been banned.Of course, I move onto the support website. I submit a support ticket explaining my issue and get a response back within minutes of posting the ticket. I was impressed!! Such fast response times!!Just kidding, it was just an automated response explaining that bans are automated and they can't do anything about it. So then I decided to call. 51 calls just to get into the waiting line, 47 minute hold, brief explanation of myself, and another 7 minute hold all to be told the same♥♥♥♥♥♥the automated system on the website told me.I still have no idea as to why I was banned. Never hacked. Never modded. Never abused anybody. Thank you support for literally wasting my time.Other than the stupid banning of innocent people, including a friend of mine who has been temp banned twice now and will be perma banned on the next one, it's fun with friends.Would I recommend it? If you can avoid being perma banned by a broken automated system, sure I would, but I can't say that is possible./Ijustneededtovent /endrantEDIT: This was originally a reddit post, when I state 2 days ago, I really mean a while ago.EDIT 2: To all those saying ""just shut up, you cheated admit it, stop lying"" you clearly either haven't played long enough or consistent enough to have the broken automated system touch you in inappropriate places, or you are just that one special snowflake that is so ignorant to all the evidence of false-positives.

I know from firsthand experience. This latest thing about them not wanting people to mod the game with OpenIV is just icing on the cake. Their game and practices have been invalidating users' purchases since it was released on PC, and they aren't doing a thing to fix that.My original issue was with their built-in anti-cheat. Instead of using a tried and true anti-cheat mechanism like VAC or PunkBuster or EAC, they decided they'd do better, and added something of their own to the game. Somehow, they screwed it up way, way worse than any of the other solutions out there. Surprising, huh?Their anti-cheat not only doesn't ban uses who are quite obviously using cheats, but it also bans users who aren't doing anything wrong at all! That's what I paid $60 for! They took a brute-force console-style approach to anti-cheat. Anything that's running on your system that might even LOOK at the game's memory while running will get you flagged, and that includes: streaming software, chat overlays, FPS counters, virus scanners, hell even steam's own FPS counter was doing it at one point. The real kicker is they won't admit that their system makes any mistakes, let alone tell you what on your system is setting the anti-cheat off.That point is hammered home when you try to contact support about the issue. Any and all tickets even mentioning the word ""ban"" in them are automatically closed with an automated response, and calling their support line and saying the same thing results in an aggressive script-reading and disconnected call. If you think I'm joking, just try it for yourself. This review will still be here for you to read, I'll wait.Back already? Good, because there's just a bit more left. See, a large portion of the community is so blindly entranced by the game series that they assume Rockstar can do no wrong, and swear that anyone that has a problem is either a liar, an idiot, or both. I've been falsely banned TWICE from the game, and just about every response I've gotten when mentioning it has been ""you cheated, you got what you deserved."" Productive bunch, eh?So let me just say that this latest anti-consumer move from the GTA giant comes as not even the slightest inkling of a surprise for me, someone who LOVED this game, someone who was waiting for its release, someone who doesn't have a ton of money and saved up for it, who feels completely cheated and betrayed. I won't be buying another Rockstar product again. I hope the company hits such dire times that they get dismantled and the property is sold off to someone who can do the customers justice. Lastly, I hope the people who are making these actively harmful decisions step on a lego, have it fly into their mouth and then choke on it.By the way, you should all go into the tags for this product and report the one that says ""Moddable"". It doesn't apply anymore. Thanks for reading."

Sure. It works. But there's no fun to be had in single player if you can't play with the mods out there. Mods are GTA V's life support. Hacking online has been an issue across all platforms; not just PC. Blaming OpenIV for that is abscent-minded and stupid. There's obviously some sort of bottom line here that Take-Two wants to meet. It just doesn't make any sense to blame OpenIV, an OFFLINE tool, for the hacking online. Not just that, but over two years inot the game's life on PC.At the end of the day, Take-Two is the same Take-Two they always have been, only now people are finally aware of it. I can't support a company that makes up false excuses in a pathetic attemntp to draw more audience to their online mode amd subsequently attmept to generate more revenue via Shark cards.Take-Two, you're just as bad as Ubisoft, Activision, and Konami. At least EA is making strides to improve. All you publishers care about is money which is what makes me hate this industry more and more every day the more and more I read about it and the non-sense that goes on, and also how you people essentially treat your studios and employees like work horses.It's a shame we have people who identify as gamers who mindlessly buy everything that's thrown at them no matter how miserable these publishers treat their clientel.

108,295.9,Not Recommended, April 15,13,"Rockstar - who made their brand on PC with the first two GTAs - don't know how to PC anymore nor how to make online play enjoyable for their customers.- It's a free-for-all in terms of cheating. People with third-party mods granting them pretty much complete control of everything go about their business unhindered ruining the game for everyone else. Every single session with fifteen or more players has at least one. No exceptions, not a single one, since I returned a couple of weeks ago. Adversary mode too is littered with them. There's no anti-cheat in this game whatsoever, it's the worst I've ever experienced by far.- Spawn system makes this a griefer's paradise. Want to intercept someone doing a mission and attempt to ambush them, but then you get killed without managing to blow their haul to bits? Don't worry, no need to run crying home to mommy, Rockstar will spawn you right on top of them again and again and again with an rpg in hand until you finally manage to hit them. And also if you do manage to kill them, they'll get spawned half a mile away giving you plenty of time to destroy their product before they can do anything.- Always visible to everyone. Another beautiful feature. Other games make it so that you're only visible on radar when firing a shot (unless silenced) or during certain events or if your enemy possessess certain gadgets. Here everyone can keep track of you all the time meaning tactics and precautionary measures are pretty much worthless.- Connectivity issues all day long and horrible loading speeds. You'll spend almost as much time getting tossed in and out of online mode or between sessions while watching the loading circle in the bottom right of the screen as you'll do playing the game.- All heists are scriptet to death, making them repetative and boring as fook in the long run. If you've managed to do them once there's no challenge in ever doing them again. Also a lot of the gear you buy in freemode will not work during heists. Spent 100k on a Thermal Helmet? Good on you, but sorry we won't have that once you enter a heist just because... Reasons. It's only good for shooting civs out of their car in freemode. You get a cool mask though (which has no point to it whatsoever) and other stuff we ripped off from the way superior heisting game known as Payday 2.Yeah I'm not ""pu55yfooting around"" Rockstar I'm telling it straight! xD- Missions too are the same every single time you do them. Same challenge and same reward. Considering how old this game is there's also a very limiten amount of them. And ofc you'll risk the previously adressed griefers, which would be fine if the game wasn't riddled with the forementioned army of cheats and plagued by the equally forementioned dumbass spawnsystem and all-seeing radar making them pretty much impossible to defend against unless you have a small army by your side and possess godlike assets.- Clunky menus made for consoles (and a mess even by that standard) all around, no matter what you hope to do. You can't even customize the weapon wheel nor rid yourself of weapons you no longer have use for. Every session you have to spend time scrolling through a gazillion pieces of undesirables in order to configure your setup the way you prefer, only to have it all reset again the moment you enter a new session or any vehicle.- Pay2win... Shark Cards. Enough said, no need to elaborate.- The smartphones... In the middle of a gunfight? Ofc you have to answer the same call you've already answered fifty times previously just as whomever's fighting you has you centered. If someone called you rl as often as they do in this game it would constitute harassment, and the fact that you can't simply choose to ignore calls or turn the phone off but it interupts your play whether you want it or not... Just. Plain. Dumb.- No permament memberships of your organization. Want to be an MC president or a CEO? Have your friends join in as members? Or maybe you're happy ""just"" being an Associate, Enforcer or a VP within someone elses syndicate? Well whatever organization you're in will be reset every time it's deactivated. There's no continuity whatsoever, no ""soul"" if you may. You have to reinvite everyone every single time and reassign positions. I see no point in this whatsoever beyond forcing players into spending $$$ buying their own MC / Office / Facility / Bunker / Whatever due to the fact that ""being a mere member"" holds no value beyond your current session.- You can't alt-tab. It'll kick you after two minutes if you do, and also doing so will mess up loading times even further. It'll also cause the game to freeze, desynch and even crash on occasions. Alt-tabbing is actually a human right and has been so for the past fifteen years so I believe someone ought to report this gross infringement of our civil liberties to the UN.And this is just from the top of my head. Despite all this I still play it and even manage to enjoy it from time to time - because even though I'm focusing on the negatives in this post there's a ton of fun to be had as well especially when playing with friends.But in all honesty it's a diamond wrapped in fity layers of turd. Turds that could easily have been dealt with even if the devs actually cared about their product and were capable of making sound decisions in terms of furthering gameplay and user experience. And on the rare occasion you actually do get to see that diamond maybe touch it even, you'll already be so full of feces it's hard to enjoy the experience without feeling dirty somehow.Been looking forward to Red Dead Redemption 2 for years but in the hands of Rockstar... I doubt I'll get it because if this game is anything to go by then they really can't be trusted to make it a worthwhile investment. Sad but true, I've bought every GTA there was and also Red Dead Redemption but with this nonsensical, halfarsed, broken pile of cheats known as ""GTA Online"", their relationship with me (and their customers in general) has turned abusive I'm afraid."

Don't support companies that don't fix their games and blame mods for ruining their profits.I'll explain... GTA Online requires grinding for money (GTA$) if you wanna get the cool stuff, so it obviously requires time or you to buy Shark Cards with REAL money to get millions of GTA$. So, this money is important for Rockstar/Take Two interactive but it's also important for the game, because part of this real money is what keeps the game going and receiving updates/DLC. The game has big vulnerabilities because it does not have an effective built in anti-cheat/hack engine (if it ever had one), it's also somewhat unstable during online gameplay with Heists being ruined with disconnects and glitches/bugs.GTA has always been fun and great with the modding scene, with mostly single player mods, or even multiplayer mods but that don't run or affect official GTA online servers. However, side effect is that same mod tools that allow great mods to exist also can be used by cheaters to obtain fake money (GTA$) in GTA Online, and cause disruptive gameplay (god mod, remove people's vehicles, guns, teleport them elsewhere, etc). That is because the game has vulnerabilies, and not because the mod tool exists. Nothing is stopping someone else to develop a new tool that will keep ruining the game and possibly creating losses of profits for Take Two Interactive.Obviously the mod tools intended use is not for cheating or gaining ""illegal""/fake GTA$ money, but in order to protect their game and profits, Take Two interactive decided to send a cease and desist letter to a popular mod tool (Open IV) site to stop developing and distributing the software that is essentially the base for all mods. Instead of fixing their game and creating mechanisms that block those illegal exploits, they decide to target the modding community.TL;DR: Because of a few deranged people, they ruin it for everyone.They have the right to protect their game, but they should act more professionally and considerate of the large user base that likes GTA because of the single player mods or non-official multiplayer mods for non-official gameplay."

They say they're auditing my account, but they never get back to me. If you know of anyone or any place I can contact to help me out, please let me know.***I've left the old review below, but I'm writing a more in-depth one since I've been through a lot of♥♥♥♥♥♥About a week before the Finance and Felony update, I started up GTA Online to kill some time. Played around for about an hour, then went out. About 2 hours later I got an email saying I was banned.I played as I normally would, never used mods in single player or online etc. etc. Created many support tickets, which were all instantly closed. TOP TIP: If you want to send them a ticket regarding a ban, file it under 'bug report'. This guarantees a human will look at it, at the very least. Filing it under anything to do with a ban will auto-solve it and get you an automated message telling you to ♥♥♥♥ off. Good support.So 10 days pass, no reply. My ban was over exactly the day Finance and Felony came out, so I played it for a bit. They'd taken all my money, ~$15,000,000. Some was given to me by a modder, most notably I got a very large sum by beating a random person in a point-to-point race (~$10,000,000 instantly for winning). My money was reset to $20,000.TOP TIP #2: You don't get banned for receiving or using modded money. Only by being a cheater. Google it if you don't believe me, there's a post by Rockstar Games on their support forums.About 2 hours later, I was banned again. 1 month this time.At this point, I'd spoken to a lot of other people with the same issue, but no word on whether Rockstar was even aware of it.About a week into the 1 month ban, I heard people were getting unbanned. Started up the game, and I was unbanned too. I have screenshots in my library that show the initial ban, the 1 month ban, and then the unban message. Stating my RP had been returned to a previous state for whatever reason.So I played normally, everything seemed fine.That is, until about a week ago. There was another ban-wave. Wouldn't you know it, I was banned again. 1 month again. There is a screenshot of that too, which proves my other ban was overturned (Rockstar NEVER overturn bans, unless they ban you by mistake). I received my second 1 month ban before the first one was even scheduled to end.I am still banned now, and have been banned for almost 1 month all up, completely illegitimately.♥♥♥♥♥♥s ♥♥♥♥ed, Rockstar doesn't care and I get a bunch of nerds telling me I deserved it.It's interesting to note that Rockstar have not contacted me at all through-out this entire mess. Not even when I was unbanned, to let me know they'd fixed their ♥♥♥♥ up. Much less to apologies.Also interesting to note that a lot of people blamed VoIP programs and a bunch of those nerd gamer overlay programs for getting them banned.

Even though there's not much stuff to do there, those few Heists are fun experience with friends (if you ever happen to find server that doesn't have hackers in it). But be warned, the Online mode is filled with Hackers who ruins the game, and Rockstar just sits idle doing nothing to stop them (or at least it feels like that).Verdict: 5 / 10 - Painfully average game"
69,945.1,Not Recommended," November 19, 2017",26,"Singleplayer is alright. If you have no intention on playing GTAO then the game is fine.GTAO on the other hand is completely terrible. Rockstar does not care in the slightest about the player experience and only wants to sell as much shark cards as possible. The grind is completely designed for that. One or two missions may be fun the first two or so times you do them but after that it all blends into the same monotonous mush.The game is also completely saturated with cheaters that Rockstar will do nothing about because blowing up every player in a session, trapping players in cages or teleporting players into the middle of the sea is fine with Rockstar. The only cheats they might on occassion do something about are money cheats because if you're cheated money then you don't need to buy a Shark Card.Too much effort is needed to have some bit of fun in this game and nine times out of ten it will be ruined because someone decides it will be funny to spam explosions on you with their cheat menu."

There are so many rules in-game that it doesn't even feel like a Grand Theft Auto game. Recently, TTI and Rockstar decided it would be a good idea to kill the game once and for all by making it ILLEGAL, yes illegal, to use mods in SINGLE PLAYER in order to try and make players play more online and purchase more of their crappy sharkcards (in game money for real money). So basically, GTA V is dead thanks to the greediness of the developers and their lack of care for the consumers.

My negative review is simply because it doesnt deserve such high praise.Everything in this game thats good is offset by something bad, almost always tied directly to Rockstar being greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. The world is incredible. Beautiful map, the amount of detail is astonishing. The vehicles are fantastic. Theres plenty to do and see. Its also a NIGHTMARE to play.You'd think some of that over $500,000,000 they made JUST IN MICROTRANSACTION SALES would go into moderating the online play, but that would cut into their profits.It is next to impossible to join a single server that isnt plagued with MULTIPLE modders. Almost all of which do nothing but blow you up, teleport and godmode their way to win events, strip your weapons, and crash your client. Considering the price of EVERYTHING in this game is set by Rockstar to try to make you buy their horrendously overpriced shark cards, Having modders ruin damn near everything in the game that you can use to make money makes it next to impossible to buy anything if you werent lucky enough to have had cash dumped on you ages ago that didnt get you banned. The only modders Rockstar ever seems to even try to deal with are the ones that spawn money, because Rockstar doesnt care about players who are ruining the game, only ones that might make them lose money from microtransactions.Once Rockstar has your money for the game, they dont give a♥♥♥♥♥♥how your gameplay is.They even removed the ability to email information about modders in, which could include video footage. Now its just the report button. Which the latest mod menus seem to be able to block from sending anyways, from what everyone says now.I dont regret having bought the game, but its saddening to see Rockstar going the way of EA and so many AAA game devs these days. I'll honestly have to think hard about it on whether I'd be willing to buy a new GTA after this one.I miss the developer that ruined my childhood innocence with San Andreas back in the day.

I really can not say enough good things about it.But I can't recommend it. Rockstar just makes so many sketchy business decisions. The game verifies with their social club every time it's launched, and i've had situations were I was unable to play in offline mode because of it. The game also tries to make money off of microtransactions. But worst of all, was what they did during the steam sale. They bundled GTA V with other things (older GTA games, in-game items, etc), raised the price to 80, advertised 25-33% off, and sold it for 60. Basically, the raised the price just to slash it down to the regular price and promote a ""sale"".This game truly is wonderful and spectacular in every category. It's a shame that Rockstar treats their customers so badly. Don't buy it until they clean up their act."

The game itself is great, I love the new features, graphics, characters, etc. However, there are so many bugs and problems it makes playing impossible. The first most annoying problem is the crashing. At startup, the game crashes after looping the intro sound for about 5 minutes. Only after that can you play by pressing the retry button. Second, the game is very, very, very laggy. After playing about 10 minutes of smooth as silk gameplay, the game fluctuates from high fps to 0, in many stutters. It is not my pc or anything because the game is very smooth with inconsistent, frequent stutters, not a rough constant fps. This makes playing unbearable, even low fps would be preferred. Lastly, a few minor bugs are that in the voice settings menu, if you go down to it, the game automatically freezes and crashes.UPDATE:For some reason, I played today and got dream results. No crashing for the first time ever when opening, and it did not stutter once, even after leaving the game for some time. Amazing getting to play the game the way it was meant to be played, I only hope it stays this way."

Despite this game's long list of negative qualities, I was a loyal player for several years and have put in over 2000 hours into the online mode, but I can honestly no longer recommend this game.The online mode is filled with game breaking bugs, that can cause you to lose hours of progress in a matter of seconds, that Rockstar has never bothered to fix. Most recently Rockstar's anti-cheat (if you can even call it that) has started banning innocent players for unknown or minimal infractions, including a few of my friends, causing their accounts to be wiped with no option to appeal. My friends and I have always strived to play the game legitimately, and have gone to great lengths to avoid the massive infestation of cheaters in the online mode... but why bother playing the game when Rockstar is willing to wipe away a clean player's account, and potentially thousands of hours of progress, at a moment's notice for little to no reason? All the while, the actual cheaters are still running free with their throw away accounts, exploding or caging entire lobbies, and just generally ruining the game for the few players left still willing to chance their accounts by logging on.Rockstar's customer support, which is practically nonexistent, is without a doubt the worst 'support' I've ever seen in a gaming environment. Unless things change in a very big way, writing this review will be the last time I waste on a Rockstar product.Side note: the single-player is ok, I guess."

Which is horrible considering the guys at FiveM and GTA:MP, with extremely limited resources, built (or tried to build) a better product than Rockstar Games did with GTA Online.Single Player does not appeal after being beaten once and GTA Online is saturated with issues and there is nothing to do after 50-100 hours. Yes, you can (try to) have fun with friends in a private session, if all goes well. But thats just not enough.I hope someone at Take Two Interactive realises that mods prolong the life of a game on PC. For example, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. Even after 5 years, its still one of the top selling games. Even Rockstar Games' own Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, which is still active even after more than a decade has passed since its release. This is because of the mods (SA:MP and MTA:SA). Also take a look at Just Cause 2. They have an official Multiplayer Mod which is infact built by the community.This is probably the last game I ever pre-ordered, and definitely the last game I will buy from Take Two Interactive, atleast at the full price. They have overlooked community needs to earn profits. And when the community tried to build something on their own, they used their power to crush them.

You need money for bullets, money for cars, money for houses, money for almost everything, it's the Lifeblood of the game. - |||So in my opinion :The online feels like a massive grind. You'll get around but it just feels like you'll never enjoy the game to it's fullest without money.The community is just random, either they wont ever bother to talk to you or straight up blow up everything you love and care about.It really feels like a pay to win game.Did I mention the hackers and modded accounts that will make you feel poor?New DLC out! Great! What new content will I try? Oh, I can't really afford any.Alright, I got really side-tracked there, sorry.I used to love GTA, but it feels that they've went way to greedy on everything and basic things that could be done to fix the game or improve it are shunned upon by the creators and instead we are given ever more expensive content to either buy shark cards or grind for 4 hours straight to get ONE CAR. It's just not the kind of game I wouldn't buy, and yes, I regret buying it.-----------------------------Thank you for stopping by, I hope this helped you in anyway, take your time to read other reviews and don't stick with just one, remember this is my opinion and yours might differ from mine.Good luck and Cheers :)"

189,18.4,Not Recommended," December 13, 2016",66,"I played about 80 hrs on the PS3 and LOVED the single player campaign. Then I bought the PC edition because I liked the idea of GTA Online, but wanted a keyboard and mouse to be competitive. Well played, Rockstar.1.) Load times were absolutely ridiculous.I don't have this problem on any other games except this one, it's probably the P2P nature of the multiplayer. I'm talking 3-4 minutes until the map loaded...before and after every single mission. Since the early missions take about 10 minutes, to me this felt just like TV with a 1:2 ratio of ad time to entertainment time. The ad time in this case is the GTA:O backgrounds and a small rotating icon in the bottom corner.2.) Controller vs keyboard issues.a. I want to play the driving parts with a controller, and shooting parts with a mouse. I got kicked many times because I would use the controller to join the match, then it would say I am using a controller, and the game owners kick me because using a controller for GTA:O PC edition is ♥♥♥♥ing noob. Teaming up with strangers is really frustrating and it started to get forced upon me really early in the mission sequence.b. Many of the games I wanted to join would require me to turn on ""auto-aim assist"" as the host requested, which as a veteran gamer I will not do. It would be like telling Barry Bonds that he has to use a T-ball stand each time he hits the ball from now on.3.) Hackers.None of the records mean anything. You'll see ""world record for this 2-lap race: 0.0001 seconds"" and it never gets fixed. I heard a lot of reports of people being banned for using voice-chat programs, and still see at least 1 hacker in every single game I joined.4.) Hidden costs.If you really want to enjoy all this game boasts, you either need to invest hundreds of hours grinding, cheat, or buy the shard cards.TL:DR;I really loved the single player, and would recommend buying the single player game to anybody who hasn't played it yet... it's really fun! At this point, however, I can not recommend GTA:Online and that's where they're putting the entirety of their effort. They are not banning hackers or implimenting paid DLC which you could just play right away, or introducing a police mode, or any of the other things their fans are wanting. They are instead releasing update after update catered to the game's hackers and billionaires in an attempt to sell more shark cards.Buyer beware..."

200,330.0,Not Recommended," September 17, 2016",303,"Pre-ordered this game straight away when it first came to steam. Been playing it back and forth for 330 hours total. I had a ton of fun playing with friends and just doing stuffs online. Then all of a sudden i got a ban after i got the X80 Prot car (Or whatever it's called). A 1 week ban. I made a ticket and got a automatic bot reply. Waited for the ban to disappear to go in again. Then I notice all my money is gone (they wipe your account when you get a ban) so I started playing a heist with my brother and some friends. On the last part of the heist, I got another ban for 1 month. I still don't know what it is I am doing that's against their rules. I make 4 tickets in hope of getting a reason for my ban and all I get are bot replies. After a while, I manage to do a ticket with the title ""connectivity issues"" and explained that I was afraid to log in cus I didn't want another ban, and this time, I get a reply from a person. This person said ""we do not know the reason since it's a bot that's banning people"" and calmly said ""but you shouldn't be afraid to log in."". I trusted this guy so I logged in after my 1 month ban and managed to play for a day. HOWEVER on the next day I started playing, I got a PERMANENT ban and I still have NO clue whatsoever what I got banned for. Talked with some guys in a GTA group and they said I will most likely not get unbanned. *NOTE* I was NOT modding, cheating or abusing anything in the game at all.

27,905.3,Recommended," April 25, 2015",216,"Hey guys, I don't usually write reviews, but Grand Theft Auto V is a game that is absolutely worth it.A game that breaked most impressive records of Guiness Book:Best-selling action-adventure video game in 24 hours (12 milion copies)Best-selling video game in 24 hours (564 milion$)Fastest entertainment property to gross $1 billionFastest video game to gross $1 billionHighest-grossing video game in 24 hoursHighest revenue generated by an entertainment product in 24 hours (including Hollywood movies)Most viewed trailer for an action-adventure video gameMost viewed trailer of an action-adventure video-game (800+ milion views)Graphics1. Graphics texture optimization is absolutely incredible. The game runs smooth on any kind of GPU's and CPU's as long as you can meet the minimum system requirements. By the way, these requirements are actually not that high for a game that has such breathtaking graphic details.2. Graphic details are the best I have seen, especially in an open-world game. If I was to tell you all about this topic, I would probably need to make a coffee to keep me awake for many hours, because boy there are lots to talk about. I'm just gonna write some of the features that stood up for me.a) Sure this is not something new in its essence, it has been done before and not just in GTA, but the way we see it here it's what's amazing. The way the light shifts from one period of the day to another it's off the charts. You don't even realize when the afternoon becomes evening. The only way you can tell, it's that a beautiful sunset light is falling down upon you.b) Again, not a new feature, actually is quite an old one the way it's been reproduced in GTAV ... You can literally see every rain drop falling on the ground and splashing itself at impact. Apart from the obvious, what makes rain so special in GTAV ? Well, . This is something that not many people talk about, yet is one of the breathtaking features of the game.The way Rockstar Games produced the sound in game its mind blowing and it has a great effect on the rain (besides everything else).c) Sure we had night in GTA IV and even before that, so why do I mention this ? Well, because the city never looked better under the moonlight shadows. I am not talking just about the graphics aspect. What I'm saying is that the night in GTAV gives you the impression of actual liveliness; the whole city comes to life. It's just like in the real big cities when people go out at night to party or to do whatever.3. Cars are the best looking and are way ahead those we've seen in previous GTA's. I'm not talking about a direct comparison, because of the obvious reason (2015-2010) but what I'm trying to say is that I personally wasn't that impressed at the time by the cars/helis/planes in GTA4 as I am now in GTAV.Gameplay and FeaturesOh yea, the gameplay options and features are the best weapon for GTAV to fight against any competitor now and in the years to come.1. I feel like thanking Rockstar games for actually doing a great job in this matter. Car control was preety much garbage in GTA IV and for this reason alone I had no big expectations for this new series. Well, I was wrong. The car control is so well polished that it gave me the impression of playing NFS MW back in the day. Besides the control, there is the sound of the car's engine which is perfectly accurate.2. Now what in God's name I'm talking about?! Well, have you been driving down the coast or in the mountains or even in the city borders and happen to meed somebody out of the blue crying for your help ? A woman's that was about to get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ a kid who's bike was stolen, hitchhiker asking you to take her/him home, etc usually for a reward. If you think about that it dosnt sound like a big deal, but baby, this stuff gives GTAV a whole new dimension of impersonating reality in a video game.3. Again, not something new but let me tell you why this one is so damn special. Have you tried modifying the car's suspension? Of course you did, what am I saying! But have you actually paid attention of it's realism the change was made? Well, for those who haven't and for the one's who dont own the game yet, let me tell you that this feature is game-making. My favorite car in GTAV is the Grotti Carbonizzare also known as the Ferarri F12. Now think, how am I gonna drive that beast on the city's roads? Especially in areas like Groove, Hilwood, Rockford. These are just some of the areas that have bumpy roads, so you cant really drive a Ferarri in these parts of the town. Well, you can. Modifying the suspension to a higher state doesn't just make for visual effects, but actually changes the way the car handles the bumpy roads, turns, hard turns. BTW, if you move your mouse besides the car while taking a turn, you can actually see the suspension come into play even on lowest graphic settings. For me, this is one of the best things I've seen in this game.4. Driving, mission making, robberies, flying, hunting, diving, piloting aircrafts, submarines, boats, golf, tennis, cards, smoke weed, racing, playing the stock market. You will never get bored in this game, not even in Single Player mode."

They enact sweeping account changes that are meant to target cheaters that end up hurting a lot of legitimate players, and their support staff only offers canned, automated responses to queries, with no hope of further appeal.If you're a die-hard GTA fan, buy the game when it's on sale.Do not waste your money on shark cards; for what they get you, they are absolutely not worth the expense, not even when rockstar is running their ""shark card bonus cash"" event.Depite rockstar's statements to the contrary, potentially all but a tiny handful of that cash can be taken away from you if your account is inadvertently tagged as having received ""illegitimate funds,"" and the amount taken usually numbers in the millions.For reference, the $100 shark card, the most expensive offered for purchase, only nets you $8 million in the online multiplayer game. Many top-end in-game purchases (vehicle storage, money generators, etc.) run up a bill of several million WITHOUT added options. Fully customized, some vehicles and properties can eat up the lion's share of $8 million in-game cash by themselves.The alternative is hundreds of hours of grinding the game missions over and over, with all the interference and wasted time care of dirtbag/idiot players inbetween.And just to remind you: all of this expense, be it in cash or time, can vanish into the ether without warning, leaving you with nothing to show for your effort.But hey, you can always buy more shark cards, says rockstar.Seriously, though.

Grinding to get money to buy stuff you want is one of the more satisfying things ingame for awhile. If you have friends gaming can even better!On the whole I can't recommend this game thought. I but my heart and soul to this game 455 long hours of grinding, dealing with grievers and modders. Trying to play with rockstars rules with more and more higher price tag stuff. I got my account banned and deleted because Rockstars programm flagged my account, banned it and deleted my character and all my stuff (planes, cars,boats,houses,facilities.etcetc) that was bought on hard grind. When I finally got Rockstar support on the chat to talk me about this it was 8 hours after the ban. All they could say was that there is no way to get unbanned and my character is deleted for eve and kept on saying they would love to help me but they can't do anything. I asked numerous times what I did wrong, why I got banned, what was the reason? the anwer that I got was always that program striked me with ""legit ban"" nothing more nothing less. No information, no human conformation if this was even right. just program hitting me for ""legit ban"" and deleting my stuff. If you have this big of network and community atleast have somekinda system that lets player know what they did wrong. I have no idea what I did wrong. I have never cheated, griefed or exploided any of things rockstar listed me as possible reasons, so I'm left with empty dissapointed feeling of almost getting scruwed out of game I loved. All they kept on telling me is that I just need to start all over after my 30 day ban is done, but why I would do that if program can hit us normal players that play by the book. Why I would but another 455 hours of my life to this game if you rockstar clearly do not care about me or players. Why in earth I would do that.This left so bitter taste in my mouth. I loved and I love this game over anything else. All that pride I felt after seeing young players whining and crying for modder the money, while I did build my business empire with my own two hands. There is no way to lift ban off from myself. There is no way to get my character back after its gone or atleast that is what they kepts saying me. 8 hours it took to rockstar real person to look my case and he could not gave me any anwer of why just running in circles telling me how their anti-cheat is best in the world and do not do any mistakes (yeah how about few weeks earlier) iceing on the cake was when support manager ended our chat by thanking of my comession for buying their games and said to have good rest of the day. No I was left with empty feeling and dissapointed.Rockstar programm took something away from me, something that used to love to do, playing with friends and all. And I did not get any anwer just sentence ""legit ban"" that sounds more like home made guild telling you're banned then multi biljon compnany. Best part of this is if I get another this ""legit bans"" once again even when I have not done anything my account is permabanned.In summery, I do not know why I got banned, Rockstar support do not know why I got banned, Nobody know why I got banned and nobody care why I got banned.

When Gotten Gains started it started causing many, if not everyone performance issues.Also, Rockstar was originally banning people for using singleplayer mods which was a♥♥♥♥♥♥move by Rockstar.In fact I believe most negative reviews on this game is because people have been banned for using singleplayer mods such as the FOV mod.Grand Theft Auto V itself is easily a 8, 9, or even 10/10 game in most reviews.The AI is amazing, esspecially the cops in this game.The visuals of this game are incredible.It has a good story and unlike past Grand Theft Autos, three main characters, each with there own unique personality.The voice acting is great, it has a good story and it's so fun to playthrough it.However that's the game itself, multiplayer lobbies as I said are trash, with hackers and poor optimization.Most of the games community is very aggresive and modders/hackers everywhere.The fun in missions, heists, races, etc can easily be spoiled in some way.Such as doing a heist, and somebody decides to leave. It's over, the heist will end and you'll have to find someone else.This game is very difficult for me to review because this is one of my favorite games.It's just due to Rockstar and some of the community to make the experience annoying.I feel that because after everyone beats Grand Theft Auto V and goes to GTA Online though i'd have to give it a negative review.

63,299.0,Not Recommended," May 10, 2016",163,"GTA 5 is a bit of a conundrum for me, because I can't really review the whole thing as one game. GTA 5's campaign and GTA online are two very different things, and deserve two completely different reviews (I also want to note, I've also played this on PS3 pretty much since it came out, and have played WAY too many hours on it on console).First off is GTA 5's single player campaign, which is, in my opinion, really REALLY good. There's not much more to say other than that the characters are all pretty damn fun to play as. The game is just good, and the attention to detail is surprising in some areas. You wouldn't think that a group developing a sandbox crime heist em up would spend too much time on the little things like golf or tennis, but both of them play really well. The golf in particular probably plays better than some games that are completely dedicated exclusively to golf. From GTA 4, the driving, shooting and melee attacks are all vastly improved aswell.Now the tumorous, microtransaction riddled elephant in the room, GTA Online. Simply put, it's a massive grind. Apartments that you can set up heists from are so expensive you won't be buying one for a pretty long time. New cars are similarly overpriced (the newest super car in the game costs 2 million). Vehicle modifications such as armor, engine tune ups, suspension, and so on are many times more expensive than they are in single player, and completely uncustomizable vehicles like planes, helicopters and boats tend to cost even more than apartments do (because logic I guess). All of this seems to have been done solely for the purpose of selling Shark Cards, Rockstar's overpriced means of aquiring money with no effort. You can buy these cards at prices ranging from 2.99 (which I believe only gets you a hundred thousand, not enough to buy and upgrade 1 single gun with full ammo) to 99.99 (which gives you 8 million). Looking back at their newest super car at 2 million, that means that if you want to avoid the grind, it will cost you around 50 real life dollars of REAL MONEY, to fully upgrade a fake car that only exists in a video game, leaving you with just a little spending money. Even more ludicrous are the new yachts, which act as big floating player homes in the ocean. These start just shy of 5 million. To put it plainly, according to Rockstar, they seem to think that a fake yacht in a game is worth roughly 60 to 70 dollars in real life money. This is more than the retail price of GTA itself, and is just aweful.To sum up this half rant/half praise of a review, it almost seems as though GTA 5 was designed and developed by a group of dedicated professional game developers, who cared about what they were doing and wanted to make a genuinely good game, and they did just that. The game that is GTA 5 is still a very good game, and the campaign has a fair bit of replayability to it. The city of Los Santos is colorful and fun, and even out in the country side, there's an astonishing amount of detail. However, it's like this team of good game designers were just sort of set aside when it came to GTA Online, at which point Rockstar decided to have a group of accountants design just about everything. Everything about GTA Online exists to make money, from the painful grind to the overpriced useless tat. It's really a shame because once you've played the heists (which reward you with almost nothing but more cars, boats, planes, etc. to buy) there's no more reason to play the game. If you just like pvp combat there are better games out there dedicated solely to pvp. If you just like to race fast cars there's better experiences to be had. It's because of GTA Online that I can't reccomend buying GTA 5 all together, especially when Rockstar seems determined not to focus any effort on any new single player content. This is all coming from someone who has been playing GTA 5 since release, and it's sad to see this happen to a game that so many had high hopes for."

Downloaded the 70GB of game files and then started it up to check that it all runs smoothly. Played single player for about an hour, played online for about an hour then turned it all off.Pick it up again 2 days later, playing through the story mode (note at this point the game appeared to be running no issues) until my friend comes home to play online. I log out for 10 mins. When I log back in I have a 30 day Ban from playing online. I'm sure you can understand my frustration.So what do I do? I jump online to see that FalseBans are serious problem with Rockstar in the past. Now I'm really feeling like crap. I call up Rockstar support, the first guy just hangs up after I give him my name, guess he couldn't really be bothered working today. I ring again, explain I just brought the game, installed, logged in and got banned, this second guy Ryan just start blurting out about banned account, nothing he can do, etc. So I ask to speak to his supervisor... he just hangs up on me. Ring again, Katrina this time, I just explain I can't even log in to play game, she starts the same spiel about banned accounts. So I say ""You're telling me you just sold me a Banned copy of the game? Because as soon as I started it up it's been banned"". Hang's up. Some customer service that is.I've seen a few posts on FalseBans but they are all from last year sometime. It appears they are still doing it. Are there others out there experiencing the same issues?

Removale of Open IV was the biggest reason I am writting this review. Modding allows games to have infinate playability such as skyrim and GTA 4, but the removal of this program lead to GTA finally going down hill.I have played a large amount of online and single player, and the multiplayer lacks depthness because it is blocked by a wall of Micro Transactions and countless hours of grinding on minigames that are shallow. Hackers getting your account banned and numerous bugs make the online mode hard to play. Even if you do acquire a large sum of in game money, the overly priced cars and houses quickly make it seems as if you are living paycheck to paycheck. GTA was never ment to be grind based game, the multiplayer should feel as a sandbox not WOW.My other issue is with single player. For this, it is a F2p version of GTA. You do not get the ability to do all the cool stuff in online despite having the funds in game. And you cant drive all the cool cars and own the property that you can in online. Without mods the single player is heavily limited. I do not recomened buying GTA anymore, and this saddens me."

That would be okay if GTA:Online were fine, but it just isn't and hasn't changed since the PC release.It's like Gabe said: ""Let's assume for a second that we are stupidly greedy. So far the paid mods have generated $10K total.

WHY??Look at Skyrim, one of the best games itself and even so much better and still played solely because of the mods..."
98,240.2,Not Recommended," December 20, 2015",14,"The game runs beautifully and looks gorgeous, even on lowest settings- but it's hard to enjoy the scenery when you're being exploded every other second.The online portion of this game has some very awful business practices implemented and very little action taken against malicious cheaters. Every session I've played in online (this is no exaggeration) has had at least one malicious hacker who would spawn too much or explode everyone- something of the sort. And while you would think that Rockstar would have a greater grip on such large-scale server affecting hacks- basically nothing is done to counter malicious hackers and it's up to players to enter Passive Mode to temporarily escape the death effects or leave the server and find a new one.The grind in the game is also very real. Earning money and RP is ludicrously slow, and nothing you buy scales properly. You can tell they've really made it a grind so as to encourage buying Shark Cards. Prime example: A yacht in the game costs approximately $8 million, and that's not even fully customized. A Shark Card that gives you $8 million in game costs $100 CDN. A not-fully customized yacht in the online portion of this game costs more than the game itself. In a heist you'll probably get $250,000 on average (i dont know, i havent played too many because finish both the setups and the finale itself requires a very coordinated crew), but that's after doing the heist setups and finale. It takes at least an hour to do all of that, so it will maybe take you at least one hour and probably a half to make $250,000. And this is with a supposedly coordinated crew- have fun trying to play Heist Setups and finales with random players- it will take many, many tries that will often make you feel like you're greatly wasting your time.To build onto that, players who have spent much time are rewarded well as their level is higher and thus unlock more content- that's nice and all, but what this means is low-level players are locked from using many items. I've got 80+ hours clocked in GTA V Online and I'm only around Level 50. You stop unlocking items at Level 120- and you only really get the higher end stuff towards Level 90+. It's outrageous, and what it really does is put higher-levelled players on a higher-level ground than lower-levelled players- it's not a difference in skill when it comes to a one-on-one snipe session with an enemy- it's a difference in level, as the newbie will have the weak sniper and the veteran will have the one-hit-kill sniper. Maybe you can't shoot down someone's helicopter efficiently because of your weak rifle- but your enemy can definitely shoot yours down with his Level 120 Minigun. The RP Level System puts older players on a higher-level ground not because of experience and skill gained, but simply because they straight up have better, upgraded items than those of lower-level players. A great imbalance of items and unlocks tilts the game towards people who are higher levelled, and those who are lower-level will have an even harder time catching up.And to further build upon the grind point, the only real viable solution to obtain money is to hope a hacker comes into the server and instead of exploding everyone decides to spawn money. It's funny, these kinds of people who spawn money for everyone because of the horrid payouts is the one who gets banned. From what I've seen, Rockstar's Anti-Cheat system is only efficient in catching people who spawn money- who cares about game-ruining hackers? You must buy Rockstar's Shark Cards for outrageously expensive prices like $100 CDN for that yacht, OR you can grind for $250,000 an hour with a coordinated team to get 1/32th closer to buying that Yacht.Not to mention the shady business practices where Rockstar purposely tries to make the game seem like it's discounted for lots but it's really not- it's actually a bundle of GTA V and a Shark Card you don't care about that artificially raises the price of the game and thus inflates the sale percentage- and also disables you from refunding the game should you want to as it's packaged with a non refundable item.All in all, you'd have to grind to get anything worthwhile and Freeroam is rather boring if you're not roaming with someone else. Pray that maybe you won't get blown up today and that maybe someone will start dropping money- that's about all you can do.A horrible, long grind which encourages horrible business practices along with the extreme lack of hacker and malicious cheater countermeasures really turns me off from the Online portion of this game. It's fun when with friends- but everything else is just ridiculous and unprofessional.They've also killed modding for GTA V, double negative rating if I could."

I repeat, if you are only interested in Online, *DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME* there have been a lot of false bans being issued recently and R* DOES NOT care if you were falsely banned. I have been banned for 4 days now and I have written 4 tickets to support, three of which have recieved the same response. Two were from a bot, the third was a real person but still the same response. I don't have a god damn clue why I was banned because Ive never modded, never exploited, and never even recieved money from any other players. The only thing Ive done in the game is cuss some guy out because he called me a f aggot after I said he was salty. Supposedly you can be banned for being overly racist, homophobic, or disrespectful towards a religion... I cussed someone out for using homophobic slurs. I defended homosexuals while he bashed them. So, if that warrants a ban, ♥♥♥♥ me right? Ive done everything I could to contact R* support INCLUDING the 4 support tickets (as mentioned above), a forum post, tweets @ and DM's to both their support and games accounts, and Ive even called the support line over 100 times, only to never talk to a human. All Ive asked for in my tickets/dms/posts/whatever is a reason for being banned, or a removal of the ban. Yet Im still no closer to understanding why I was banned. IF and ONLY if I hear back from support BEFORE my ban is automatically lifted, I will alter this review to reflect upon it. But as of right now, I cannot recommend this game for anyone only interested in the Online feature. As of this particular point in time, I wont be playing Online until I get a response from R* support telling me why I was banned in the first place, because Ive read many a post about people being banned, not knowing why, then getting banned again after attempting to play Online again.Go ahead and say what you want, Im sure I'll get lots of ""You cheated, you got caught, deal with it."" comments, but I know that I havent broken any rules and I could honestly care less what people assume of me.EDIT: They never got back to me. BUT, I would like to say that a few of the known programs that can trigger a false ban are things like TeamSpeak, Discord, and Skype as well as (possibly) Steams FPS counter or recording software like Bandicam and Fraps."

The trio get together and perform all sorts of daring heists and escapades.The game is action-packed with chases, gang shootouts, and intense heists that get crazier as the game goes on.When you're not robbing a convenience store or shooting rednecks, you can partake in all sorts of activities. You can walk your dog—Chop, go golfing, play tennis, and even get a lap dance at the strip club (Sorry Roman, there's no bowling)!The GTA Online Protagonist can be created according to the taste of the player to customize (gender or appearance). The player will choose a gender, then choose the parents and grandparents of the character to affect his/her appearance. Then, the player chooses how much the character spends his/her daily life; this will create the initial stats for the character and slightly change the appearance.After you have finished creating your character, you arrive in Los Santos with an open welcome by Lamar Davis (Especially if you're a female). He then has you do a street race with him (and other new players, if available), and shows you to Gerald, a drug runner who'll give you easy jobs to start you off in Los Santos. After you complete this tutorial, you'll join a free roam session with up to 32 other players (Who'll either become your friend or your enemy).There are multiple game modes in Online, including:There are multiple glitches in GTA Online, some are funny and weird, the others are exploits and game-breaking. So far I haven't seen any hackers, but I wouldn't doubt their existence.In retrospect, I give Grand Theft Auto V a+ Amazing story+ Excellent gameplay+ Fun with friends, and fun without them!+ Great graphics+ GTA Editor+ Heists are fun and replayable for more cash- Glitches- Trevor Phillips"

The campaign on its own is totally worth the price and with all the Stranger missions, you will be occupied for some time. However, the multiplayer is what will keep you coming back to the game for more. Rockstar's main focus post-release is on GTA: Online and with their regular release of free updates, there's always something new for players to try out. For any beginners to GTA: Online, here's a handy and short guide with all the need to knowMoving onto performance which is one of the reasons why GTA was delayed so much for PC. There doesn't actually seem to be any major problems with running it. Because the game was made with PS3/Xbox 360 in mind, the required specs aren't amazingly high. Obviously, if you want to be running it in all it's glory and at high resolutions then you will need better equipment."

184,"1,176.2",Not Recommended," June 15, 2017",10,"The single player is good, the Online portion however is the most broken goddamn thing I have seen in my gaming life.You will NEVER feel like you're earning money, all of it will get squandered on overpriced goods and ""Activities"" that will not pay you off. Being able to buy a tank to have a classic GTA style rampage? One million dollars. And it's less resistant than a vehicle you can pay less for. And you can pay a million more to have a version you can store in a garage, modify, and even swim in.With everything costing so much, you think you could just run a few heists, or maybe do work for the much-talked aboutCEO and MC missions to gather cash? Forget it. I have put over 1k hours into Online, and throughout all of it, the only time I could afford enough stuff to enjoy it was when I recieved modded cash from many, many, MANY cheaters and modders, but on that later.So, why not BUY A SHARK CARD?I have 2 words for this question:Shove off.The cards are horribly overpriced for the amounts they give. The most expensive one costs 75 euros, and gives you 8 million GTA$. You could buy a helicopter, tank, 2 good cars and maybe a basic CEO setup. While this seems good, in a sea of items to buy, you WILL feel ripped off. Cars are added constantly, with their prices almost never reaching below 400k GTA$. Modifying them to work better and look better cost even more, with a simple engine tune up costing upwards to 50k GTA$.You want to paint your car a specific shade of yellow? 14k pls.You want a set of wheels that don't look horrible? 5k pls.you want to add hydraulics that don't work properly 50% of the time, to a very limited assortment of vehicles? 100k pls.We can't of course forget about the freeroam, which is full of people using cheap tactics and items to turn your free-roaming sandbox experience into a Battlefield ripoff. Costant attacking and blowing up vehicles is pretty much the only hobby of the majority of players here, as it's not punished in any way. You can't enjoy the world you're given, because there's always a kid in a full combat armor trying to shoot you and blow up your car for no goddamn reason.Of course, you can leave the session and go into an invite-only one, or friends-only one.Only then you lose 80% of your income, as CEO and MC work largely needs a public session, which means you won't be making any money.You probably won't be making any money in a public session anyway, due to the afromentioned soldier boys making sure that any sort of delivery or sell will go up in flames.That's about 5 hours spent on making the product, and just 1 second of pulling the trigger on a fighter jet to blow it all up, and if you do manage to sell it, it's most likely gonna give you lousy 300k.That's how it feels to try and progress in this game.And of course, the modding plauge.Despite Rockstar's constant nagging that ""they're fighting the cheating menus"" and the supposed presence of an anti-cheat, going into public lobbies still have a 75% chance of your character getting endlessly teleported over the ocean, getting blown up endlessly, getting blamed on blowing up everyone, losing your money pernamently, losing your weapons and having to buy them again, having your character get disfigured, and thus, having to pay 100k to change it's appearance back to normal, and .It's a lawless wasteland due to that, which already lowers your chance of actually doing something meaningful.And then, there's the netcode.Or the lack of it, as the game RUNS ON PEER TO PEER.This is 2016-2017 people! We don't need this outdated system which is more likely to leak your IP address and lag you out, and back to single player because someone from Yemen joined in. And even if you manage to live through that, game often times out when connecting to someone, sometimes ignores invites and friends coming online, forcing you to reload online to fix it, and simply refusing to save your progress to cloud at certain times. It's infuriating at best, and downright maddening at worst.And in case you still had any sort of hope left for this game...Take 2 Interactive; Grand Theft Auto V's publisher and ""owner"" of Rockstar Games,All in all, good story mode, HORRENDEOUS ONLINE MODE,and utterly pathetic, scummy, disgusting, greedy, slimey, dissapointing, annoying and moronic publishers.Simply put, avoid at all costs; the story is worth it, But Online is an endless, broken grind with overpriced, usless microtransactions plauged with scummy playerbase and cheaters, making even sessions with friends boring and annoying to go through. Not to mention the scumbags behind the scense who only want your money and nothing else."

346,108.5,Not Recommended," June 19, 2017",10,"TLDR: banning singleplayer mods is stupid, shark cards are the root of all evil (in GTA Online).It all started great. I bought the game mostly for online, but people say the singleplayer is decent. Back in the beginning, online was pretty great too. More or less balanced weapons, somewhat reasonable prices on cars and weapons. Heists were a lot of fun while they lasted.But as the time went on, it became more and more apparent that TakeTwo, or Rockstar, cares only about their own profit. As more and more Online updates came out, all hope was lost for any quality content™. Don't get me wrong, the content of updates looks great, and some of the updates are even fun to play. But, as it would happen, there is one big 'but'. Most of the content in these ""free"" updates is gated behind stupidly expensive entry purchases, paid with in-game money. And the only thing you can do is to grind for a few weeks or months for money, or cheat (and get caught and banned, most likely), or... Buy Shark Cards for real cash.Now, I didn't mind the shark cards when the game came out. They seemed to be a fine way to let playes with little free time to quickly get enough in-game cash to get to all the content, like high-end cars and heists. Unfortunately, the developer or publisher succumbed to greed. The ability to sell shark cards led to the natural result - making updates that require players to buy shark cards to properly enjoy.And this is not all. Modding has always been an important part of gaming scene. I've had lots of fun modding Skyrim, Fallout, and a bunch of other games. Modding support greatly increases longevity of a game, and GTA V would have been no exception. Until TakeTwo decided that singleplayer mods are illegal. They have been agains Online mods since the very release of the game, and while I disagree with that stance, I could see where they are coming from (as usually, greed, shark cards aren't gonna sell themselves). It baffles my mind as to why anyone would be against singleplayer mods in a game that has no singleplayer DLC to speak of.To sum up, TakeTwo has been (and still is) too greedy about their own game. Questionable sale practices, ""free"" multiplayer content essentially gated behind shark cards, stupidest stance on modding, all for very questionable benefit.Do not buy this game. Do not support TakeTwo. They do not deserve it. And if you do, don't expect any truly free updates, and don't expect being able to mod it."

I can honestly say with full confidence this game is the epitome of every disease you can think of. The online mode is where this game really shines (or WOULD shine) other than the blockbuster-like story in single player mode, and crazy Trevor of course. But see, that's just the problem..... everybody plays the online mode, but it's so terrible, the community is toxic as f*ck, and the loading screens... for f*cks sake. Hold on, Let me create this list of bullsh*t for you real quick:1. Loading screens take forever.2. One of the most toxic communities I've ever seen, literally feels like you're playing with 9 year old kids. Not even joking.3. Bored players who will constantly f*ck with you and ruin your fun so that you can't get anything done.4. Everything is EXPENSIVE as all hell and it's extremely time consuming to make money, and you can hardly even do that without d*ckheads constantly trying to kill you and blow up your product, which is really stupid because they don't really get much of a reward out of it at all, so it further proves that they just do it to be a d*ck.5. There are HACKERS literally EVERYWHERE in this game, and they will do crazy sh*t such as spawn a ton of money in your account for no reason (which can apparently get you banned, how f*cking ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is that?) or spawn all the players on the map onto a roof top and then blow them all up with a missile.They give ZERO f*cks, and are quite annoying.6. The f*cking loading screens X___X7. You can play a Solo session, or with your friends only.... but you're not allowed to do any actual CEO or MC club work, etc without being in a public session full of d*ckheads, which makes money making almost impossible when you got mother f*ckers flying around in jets trolling everyone, blowing your sh*t up.8. You have to constantly jump from session to session, in hopes that you'll get away from said d*ckheads and can actually get some sh*t done in peace.9. And I mean the community is so toxic, I've never seen so much hostility and name calling in a video game in my life, jesus christ.......... nobody gives a f*ck about anybody or anything in this game. I mean yeah it's GTA, but the people on here get a bit ridiculous most of the time I'll be honest.10. It doesn't matter how big your gang/ crew is, all it takes is one d*ckhead with a rocket launcher or a jet to blow up your plane or truck full of cargo worth hundreds of thousands of dollars that you wasted half your f*cking day trying to make.11. I'm sure there's a couple more things I missed on this list of bullsh*t but whatever.12. This game almost drove me to the edge of insanity. I'm 27 years old, I don't need this bullsh*t right now, I need to take a break lol.13. I'll come back to it some other time, but if you, the person reading this, plans on buying it and trying it out for the online mode...... then be prepared for all the bullsh*t I just talked about, unless of course you're just some bored 11 year old turd (or grown man for all I know) that wants to get on and troll people, then by all means go right ahead, if that makes you feel better about your life.14. Oh wait, the heists..... man f*ck heists, I'm not waiting 10 years (literally) for players that are level 587 to join the lobby only to suck a** anyways and fail the heists every single time. It's bad enough low level players do which is to be expected, but man when you're that high of a level.... c'mon now. (And yes I'm being serious, though it isn't always this bad, but it can be).15. And shark cards can gobble my balls._________________________________________________________________Other than that, this game is an awesome game and very addicting, totally worth the money, you'll have tons of fun, especially in online mode, I promise :D"

272,850.0,Recommended," March 20, 2017",10,"Alright listen, as much as I love the Grand Theft Auto series, and even though I enjoy this game a lot..... I can honestly say with full confidence this game is the epitome of every disease you can think of. The online mode is where this game really shines (or WOULD shine) other than the blockbuster-like story in single player mode, and crazy Trevor of course. But see, that's just the problem..... everybody plays the online mode, but it's so terrible, the community is toxic as f*ck, and the loading screens... for f*cks sake. Hold on, Let me create this list of bullsh*t for you real quick:1. Loading screens take forever.2. One of the most toxic communities I've ever seen, literally feels like you're playing with 9 year old kids. Not even joking.3. Bored players who will constantly f*ck with you and ruin your fun so that you can't get anything done.4. Everything is EXPENSIVE as all hell and it's extremely time consuming to make money, and you can hardly even do that without d*ckheads constantly trying to kill you and blow up your product, which is really stupid because they don't really get much of a reward out of it at all, so it further proves that they just do it to be a d*ck.5. There are HACKERS literally EVERYWHERE in this game, and they will do crazy sh*t such as spawn a ton of money in your account for no reason (which can apparently get you banned, how f*cking ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is that?) or spawn all the players on the map onto a roof top and then blow them all up with a missile.They give ZERO f*cks, and are quite annoying.6. The f*cking loading screens X___X7. You can play a Solo session, or with your friends only.... but you're not allowed to do any actual CEO or MC club work, etc without being in a public session full of d*ckheads, which makes money making almost impossible when you got mother f*ckers flying around in jets trolling everyone, blowing your sh*t up.8. You have to constantly jump from session to session, in hopes that you'll get away from said d*ckheads and can actually get some sh*t done in peace.9. And I mean the community is so toxic, I've never seen so much hostility and name calling in a video game in my life, jesus christ.......... nobody gives a f*ck about anybody or anything in this game. I mean yeah it's GTA, but the people on here get a bit ridiculous most of the time I'll be honest.10. It doesn't matter how big your gang/ crew is, all it takes is one d*ckhead with a rocket launcher or a jet to blow up your plane or truck full of cargo worth hundreds of thousands of dollars that you wasted half your f*cking day trying to make.11. I'm sure there's a couple more things I missed on this list of bullsh*t but whatever.12. This game almost drove me to the edge of insanity. I'm 27 years old, I don't need this bullsh*t right now, I need to take a break lol.13. I'll come back to it some other time, but if you, the person reading this, plans on buying it and trying it out for the online mode...... then be prepared for all the bullsh*t I just talked about, unless of course you're just some bored 11 year old turd (or grown man for all I know) that wants to get on and troll people, then by all means go right ahead, if that makes you feel better about your life.14. Oh wait, the heists..... man f*ck heists, I'm not waiting 10 years (literally) for players that are level 587 to join the lobby only to suck a** anyways and fail the heists every single time. It's bad enough low level players do which is to be expected, but man when you're that high of a level.... c'mon now. (And yes I'm being serious, though it isn't always this bad, but it can be).15. And shark cards can gobble my balls._________________________________________________________________Other than that, this game is an awesome game and very addicting, totally worth the money, you'll have tons of fun, especially in online mode, I promise :D"

137,176.8,Not Recommended, March 24,10,"Update 2: I tried everything to get my account back. Rockstar keeps saying the ban is legitimate and cannot be reversed. Ticket submission, live chat, nothing works. They don't care about you as a consumer. Right now, they care about saving face, and they're going to be coming up with a reason for this bullcrap. Also, they didn't give me a refund on my $50 sharkcard that I bought before I got banned. So yeah, got my money stolen from me with no way to get it back. You know what that's called? A ♥♥♥♥ING SCAM. BOYCOTT THIS TRASH COMPANY. THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT YOU. THEY CARE ABOUT GETTING MONEY AND NOTHING ELSE. Right now, their response to this is to put everything 50% off on steam. DO NOT FALL FOR THIS. IT'S A TRAP.Update/tl;dr: Rockstar banned a buncha innocents for no reason. Please leave a bad review too, if you can. As consumers, the only way you can change a company's business practices is by making them turn their heads toward a massive wave of negative reviews. Please help us innocents!I bought this game about 3 years ago when it came out to PC. Xbox 360 was dying, and many of its users were moving on to Xbox One, but I wanted to be a PC gamer, so I switched platforms. I played it for maybe 40 hours after buying it, then didn't touch it again until now.I had sudden resurgence of playing it in the past 4 weeks, because my friends bought the game and there was so much new content to play. I bought a more expensive apartment, an office, a car storage thing for import/export, an MC clubhouse, a coke factory, a bunker, a facility, a hangar w/ mod shop, even an Akula because that thing was beautiful. All of the funds were legitimately gained through playing their new content: 8 mil through import/export, 2.1 mil through coke factory sales, 500k through CEO missions, 3.5 mil in sharkcards and who knows how much through heists.But yesterday, my account got suspended and reset. I don't know why it got suspended and reset, but I say it's for no reason at all. In addition to getting an account suspended and reset, rockstar is unable to reverse it. This is horrible business practice, and I will never play this game again. Honestly, with the amount of stuff I achieved over the past 130 hours played in the last 4 weeks, I don't want to put in the same amount of time just to receive the same fate. They actually wasted my time, and I value my time the most.That's what I wanted to leave for the review; continue reading if you want to hear my logic on why this suspension and reset was illogical and without reason.Their EULA states that they'll ban any user who is cheating, modding, or exploiting/abusing their game in any way. I take it that exploiting/abusing their game also means people who abuse in-game mechanics without the assistance of a cheat engine or whatnot. I admit that I was using heist-teleporting as a quick and easy way to teleport back to my apartment and facility, but what doesn't make sense is when I got banned. If they were going to ban me for such a thing, then it should've been during spring break when I was doing it the most. That was 3 weeks ago. I think that this is a mechanic that many people use, just because travel time in GTA can feel like forever. (You can also refill your ammo using the heist setup screen, but I find that hardly punishable). Additionally, there's a second way to teleport, which is by buying property, setting that as your spawn location, then finding a new session. I doubt people use this as much, just because you have to pay more GTA$ (to be honest, I think rockstar overlooks something like this because it has the potential to get them more sharkcard purchases).Additional reasons that don't make sense for this ban:Okay, let's say I was banned for abusing heist-teleporting. What about griefers and K/D warriors who abuse passive mode and the ""kill yourself"" mechanic. Passive mode doesn't allow other players to attack you until you come out of it; they abuse this by remaining in it until they've spotted low-level prey or someone running an in-session mission, then they come out of it and attacking so they can boost their K/D. The ""kill yourself"" mechanic is where they go to their interaction menu and choose the option to kill themselves, which doesn't reward a kill to the other player that's shooting them; this is so they can protect their ""precious"" K/D. There are so many people like this, so why don't they get suspended and reset. They are abusing an in-game mechanic too.Also, I got hit by a hacker 4 weeks ago who piled cash on me. I let rockstar know that it wasn't me, and they said that they'd remove the funds. 2 weeks passed and they never took the funds off my character. My friend said that he just put them in his account and rockstar never did anything, so I just did the same. No point in dropping the funds when I repeatedly died. If they just now tried to remove the funds, saw that I didn't have them, then suspended and reset me, then ♥♥♥♥ them. That response time is ridiculously slow, and it was only 108k, which is nothing compared to what I could make.Also, I used solo public sessions without glitching the servers like some people. I played way longer than most people--since I binge games on the weekends, as I can't play them while I'm at my apartment near my university. I kept on finding a new session until there were like 5 people on it. I stay in sessions for like 8 hours at a time; most people stay in one for 1-3 hours. so eventually people leave, and I'm left all alone. If I get banned just because I don't want to play with rockstars crappy playerbase of griefers and K/D warriors, then that's actually BS.All in all, I hope rockstar fails as a business. This game isn't just a game, it's a social platform for upkeep with friends too, and now that's gone. This is a horrible way to treat their consumers, and they really should just fail as a business--especially with how much they're trying to monetize the game."

If they let you get in a limited size party but not require that there be exactly 4 people, and then let you pick a bank/store/anything to steal from, instanced you, and then just let you do it on your terms, it would be a million lightyears better than having 5 set heists with crappy intro missions and lackluster final heists, then getting paid almost nothing when taking into account some of the cars they put out every month.Speaking of garbage they add every month, nearly every new gamemode they add is PVP re-skinned deathmatches. If I wanted to play PVP shooting I would go play CSGO.R* is moneygrubbing super hard and it hurts the game. Every new item they add now, they think that they have to make it cost a lot for who knows what reason. I assume they think there is inflation, but new people buy the game every day, meaning that everyone and their son doesn't have a lot of money. I've been playing since it came out and I don't have a lot of money. I don't know anyone that has more than maybe a few million dollars.

219,"1,540.8",Not Recommended," October 31, 2017",16,"When it comes to good games I can be very patient and don't mind minor flaws or issues, but this game is one of the very few that leaves a feeling of regret, disgust or even anger after a session. In particular GTA Online.I'll try to be quick. The single player is great and I really enjoyed it and It's woth the price Rockstar charge for the game. The game is well optimized. Plenty to do with many achievments and mission replayability. Tho Rockstar overdone with psychotic atmosphere, and sometimes I sat watching ingame cutscenes thinking: ""Oh stop shouting/screaming or just shut up"". Too much psychoshite I say. Back to GTA Online...It wasn't more or less playable until Gunrunning update (best update IMO), and then s h i t e started to happen. Cheaters/modders everywhere. You can't find a session which would be cheater free - jumping to 5-8 sessions in a row in less than 30 mins cuz every each contains cheater or one logs in shortly after you. Cheating is a cancer of GTA Online and Rockstar do nothing about it! I've encountered same cheaters twice or more and always reported them, but after some time met them in the game again... I suspect Rockstar doesn't care about cheaters, unless they cheat ingame currency and reduce the chance of people buying shark cards...Even if you get lucky and manage to avoid cheaters for a while another unpleasant thing starts to p i s s you off bad - bots. AI in this game is probably the most annoying of all AI's I've seen in last 17 years of gaming. Bots are literally trolling you on each corner: they always crash into you on purpose or even help cops or other hostiles to ram you down when you obtain stars. They are nightmare when they start panicing! Instead of avoiding accidents - they make one, and you are the target! It drives you mad cuz most of the time no matter how skilled driver or shooter you are - they just do an amazing job getting in your way! I'd give them award for the best troll AI made to date! The game does not reward you for being skilled and thats turns you off.But latest bot update was a total game killer - autoaim. Maaan, they just spray at you and almost never miss even if you move, take cover or even duck behind the weel. It meant to make your ingame cash earnings even harder but eventually it turned good ol' gunfights into a freaking nightmare. Despite games beauty and achieved progress I totally lost a will to log in back to game lately.Back to shark cards. 8 million ingame cash for £60... this is insane!!! 8 mil is close to nothing in GTA online (some outfits cost up to 100k)! If £60 is a pocket change for ya - give it a shot, but I'd rather go buy something REAL and useful than spending so much money on something that physically don't even exist!..After a break I tried Doomsday update. Heists are alright. Just one problem... ORBITAL CANON! FML. A perfect ""Spit in the face of honest GTA online players"" and ""Cheaters have fun spending your multibillion finances!"" combination. What does it mean? It means that honest folk trying to earn hard in-game money end up wasting their time and resources whilst overhyped modder scum blows his a r s e way with OS(orbital strike). And there's no way to avoid it or hide from it. I've been obliterated few times by random players. I've seen videos of people being annihilated by OS whilst resting in the bunker!! Bridges, roofs, undergrounds, water - nothing will save you! No warning, just instant death form the sky! You sellign full bunker of weapons worth over 1 million?! BOOM! GONE! All you hard work and time gone in a matter of a few moments and the t_w_a_t who shot you sits in safety laughing his a r s e off! He just spent 500-750k to ruin your day but he doesn't care - he prolly got another 300 billions to spend and you are f e c k e d !Could it be a way to highlight cheaters(by recording excesive OS use)?.. I don't know.In conclusion, it's one of a kind game(sadly!), but until it's ravaged by endless cheaters, toxic community, aim bots and greedy trolly Rockstar - it's on a highway to oblivion.I recommend SINGLE player, but I won't recommend ONLINE which is basically the head of GTA 5 game."

No new content.Want to know what playing GTA Online is like? The significant portion of the GTAV value? Well...Imagine that you live in a really crappy neighborhood, bullies and criminals everywhere. The authorities are there too, but they just sit on every corner eating donuts, getting paid for doing absolutely nothing. Yet despite all this, the cost of living keeps going up, its harder to get anything at all, but you resolve to work harder.Everyday you leave your crappy home and commute to and from work, always looking over your shoulder, worried someone will do something to mess with you.Today, you're somewhat happy, its payday and you have your pay in your pocket, finally something to show for your hard work. But then, someone assaults you, but they don't rob you, they plant a counterfeit bill in your pocket and glue a gun in your hand. They then kick you into the street, and the authorities spot you. They know what happened, they know it's a problem that happens a lot. Still they come after you, shouting ""Criminal! Drop the gun!"" You explain you can't. You show them your hand, it's like they don't listen. They beat you, just repeating ""Criminal! Criminal!"" After you're down and beaten, they find the counterfeit 20, they take it, but they take your all your pay as well, ""evidence, it all must be counterfeit,"" they say, ""but we'll let you off since you pay our salary, but stop counterfeiting money, you filthy criminal!"" They kick you one last time, then go back to their donuts, while the bully who framed you is left alone across the street laughing to themselves.That's how it feels to be a legitimate player in GTA Online. If a hacker messes with you, Rockstar will go after you, the victim, and punish you to the full extent they can, you can play for 500 hours and earn $10,000,000 and if someone does something to you, they can reset your progress to zero, or ban you at their whim. They don't have to provide any evidence, they don't have to show any proof. If you protest you get copy paste replies, telling you you're a cheater and threatening you to stop cheating and breaking their rules, and then they close your tickets.Why buy or play a game, where any progress can be reset for any reason, without any proof? You shouldn't.Rockstar is the real criminal here, it's a crime to treat loyal paying customers like this. But they do it happily."

One that is the product of years of slowly but surely tweaking and refining the wildly successful GTA/open world formula. It once again pushes the envelope of what an open world game can and should be...... All to be ruined by hackers. Rockstar, you should be embarassed by your blatant failure at even pretending to handle the hacking epidemic that is the GTA 5 multiplayer. They are everywhere. Do something about this and I'll edit my review to positive. A company that devotes almost two additional years of development to a PC port obviously cares about the platform, so please do not abandon us now. Clean up the hackers.*UPDATE*Well, over a year later and Rockstar continues to ignore the problem and ban legitimate players.Again, stop calling them mods and modders. If you are referring to playing the single player, by yourself, and altering the game, then yes, that term is correct. However, in multiplayer, running a program that directly effects and disturbs the gameplay for all users in a multiplayer environment IS NOT ""a mod"", it is a cheat/exploit/hack.Mods are meant to alter or improve a single person's experience, customize skins and textures, add features to the game that the devs didn't think about, etc. They are not meant to disrupt online players and THEIR experience. That is called CHEATING. Calling them modders makes it sound less insidious and more innocent then what is happening in this game. A single hacker/cheater/exploite, will quickly demolish a server or fill everyone with cash so they get banned blindly by Rockstar. Immediately the joy of playing such a brilliantly crafted game with your friends and strangers alike goes right out the window.Calling what people do in this game a ""mod"", when referring to the multiplayer game, would be the equivilant to calling a Counter-Strike aim bot or wall hack a ""mod"". The reason it is not is because it gives a single player a distinct and completely overpowered advantage against others in a sandbox environment where everybody is supposed to have a chance to work their way up.So a year and a half later, and Rockstar doesn't give a damn. I've been a life long Rockstar customer, but if they don't get this together by GTA6, then Rockstar will never see another dime of my money. Ever."

It's not all rainbows and sunshine tough.[I GO MORE IN DEPTH ABOUT CONS BECAUSE USUALLY PEOPLE CARE MORE ABOUT THOSE SINCE THEY'RE THE REASON YOU BUY A GAME OR NOT.]PROS:-GRAPHICS: One word: astonishing.-FPS: The game runs very smoothly if your PC can handle it, if not, I don't recommend you buy the game. Buy a better PC instead.-GAMEPLAY: It's the classic GTA, run over people, get chased by cops, rob stores etc. very nice.-STORYLINE: Great storyline, very interesting since you have three main characters you can switch with all the time. The missions are smooth and I have not encountered many bugs.-HEISTS AND MISSIONS (MULTIPLAYER): I absolutely loved the heists, same goes for the missions. Except for the loading screens, it's all very smooth.CONS:-MODDERS: Since the last patch in multiplayer I rarely encounter modders anymore. Be careful though.-PRICE: Although this game is so great, I think that it's still a little overpriced for normal people like me. (Or I'm greedy) I recommend buying it on sales if you can.-LOADING SCREENS: The game is basically a loading simulator. You have to wait a long time for basically everything you do in game; changing lobbies, starting a mission/heist, starting a race... The loading screens can take up to several minutes of waiting which in my opinion is ♥♥♥♥ed.-BANS: This hasn't happened to me or my friends yet but there's a lot of stories of people getting banned for apparently no reason. Sometimes it's because they modded in singleplayer or joined a hacked lobby. I don't know any more about this topic than the stories I've heard though.-GRINDING: To get a cool car you have to get a lot of money. How? You either grind missions for money, like the last heist. OR you buy Shark Cards for real money. I think that it's fun to do a heist two times but after the fifth time for just ONE item you want that costs a lot is just boring and bad.-FLYING WITH MOUSE: If you're a greedy ♥♥♥♥ like I am and you don't want to pay for a controller, you might find out that controlling planes with you mouse is hard as ♥♥♥♥. But that's just my opinion, maybe I'm just bad."

The over-world has an astounding amount of detail and nuance, the content is ample, the characters and story are interesting, and a lot of the mechanics are fun to use. The story is surprisingly deep and is on par with a gang/mafia style movie. One of the things that Rockstar has understood about GTA is that making the driving/traversing around the world fun makes everything else fall into place, and this game is the best in the series at it. Sometimes you just want to drive around and go sight-seeing, which is extremely fun.As a PC port, it exceeds expectations. This game is proof that it is always worth it to wait for a PC port, as long as the developer makes sure to do it well. Uncapped framerate, resolutions, lots of options for optimization, etc. The rendering distance is great, and it's very easy to see most of the distinct features of a landscape at a long distance."

Issues with the multiplayer, (which I couldn't solve but I could be wrong) and didn't see the option etc are like this;- Cant choose a server location(Nor shows you what your ping is). I mean what year is this Rockstar?- On top of possible bad connection, you cant choose the amount of players you want to play with either, it might put you in a full pop server or a server with 1 person in it. So fire up the 'find a new session' button until you can find your liking !- Because of the possible bad connection, there are server disconnects(which puts you back into the single player )- There are armored cars with bulletproof windows running around killing people, and if god forbid you want to defend yourself(only way how is blowing them up) YOU pay for their cars repair. Around 6k every time.- There are invisible cheaters with rocket machine guns.- Doings heists without 4 friends is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥br>- You can only choose what kind of session you wanna join through single player, such as private lobby. Theres only the option to find a new session on multiplayer which puts you in a random public server without asking you what kind of session you want. At the time of writing this I couldnt find it.On top of all this, there is a stuttering issue with hunderds of people are having and Rockstar support doesnt know how to respond with other than copy paste answers. (Link :All in all, multiplayer and single player feel like 2 different games entirely. Atleast made by 2 different studios.

I assume the prices for the new Gunrunning stuff (not even the militarized vehicles, simply the bases and regular vehicles) are just as outrageous.EDITSo, I decided I might give this game another shot. Boy, was that a mistake, and golly am I upset with what they've done this time. So with the Gunrunner update, you must first purchase a bunker/aircraft hangar for atleast one million dollars in order to use a majority of the new vehicles (I don't believe any of them are below the one million mark), and apparently they've added some sort of research system to weapons and base tech or something. Through this system, you can acquire a new sniper rifle that uses explosive rounds. No, we aren't talking miniature explosions that can kill you if they hit your body, we're talking normal C4 sized explosion boxes here, so that aiming is practically unnecessary. Atleast with explosives before this literally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ addition, you were required to atleast get in close or aim properly, or even have some small degree of skill in order to do this. But now, when you realize it will take ages to reach any of this new content unless you either grind or purchase shark cards (which now have a hotkey in the shopping menus) you can simply swing your mouse to your leisure, and pretty much ruin everyone's experience in your lobby. Oh, and let's not forget about how Rockstar is able to remove people who give out free money, but they can't seem to govern everyone who is Actually ruining the game, be it teleporting everyone to a single location on the map, locking on with a heavy assault rifle, or even just stealing your loadout so that you're defenseless the whole time. Rockstar has only furthered how bad this online community is allowed to be, and I can only pray that they don't let Red Dead 2 fall to this level in its online play."

Otherwise youll be standing on a street corner with a phone that keeps ringing, or until you punk someones car then your mechanic picks up instantly. :Dside note its funny how now they are cracking down on hack clients/mods now that its hurting their wallets, but not when it hurts their players.

The Story is deep and broad, the map is huge for exploration, the characters fit right into the storyline, the graphics are stunning, and GTA Online is a good experience in general. But overall I can't really recommend this game to any of my friends or others. It's definitely a good game but there's plenty of drawbacks for this game that makes it so boring and bland to play. One thing I have to admit is that after a while this game get really gets repetitive online and in story mode. Anyways I will explain why.________________________________________________________________________________________________________Like earlier, story mode is well done and all the characters fit right into it. 3 playable characters with different personalities. Story mode is long enough and the missions are challenging, interesting, and played out well. Also, replay editor is great and I have no downside for that. Another thing I love is the music choices in all radios. Rockstar never fails to pick bad music, despite that there are ones that are overplayed.However after a while this gets somewhat boring and after you complete the game it doesn't really have anything else to it. I know I can admit I haven't completed the game on PC, but after completeting it for PS3 and now the game is left in the dust for me. I feel like there could be a few more activities to add into story mode to give more of a touch to it. For example, if there was more food places to go to and eat just like in GTA IV, maybe a casino/gambling place just like how San Andreas had a few, and more properties to choose from.________________________________________________________________________________________________________The graphics in this game are beyond outstanding. The city scenes and strips are sexy, and the night has a great vibe to it. Pedestrians and NPCs fit the style of the city and the upper north. Vegetation and wildlife are beautiful and it adds creativity to the game. ALso, The deep sea is gorgeous filled a beautiful ecosystem and sea life. You can be diving by person and by submarine and just explore for hours in there. The graphics are so precise most evironments look like the real thing. Everything is beautiful in this game.Downturn is that you really need a High End PC to capture all this beauty. And having a slow computer with minimal requirements isn't going to help, it's actually gonna cause more problems in the game. So you have to actually have the money for high performance PC parts or a Pre-Built custom PC for this game. My good friend even insisted that my old graphics card wasn't gonna do anything so he literally bought me a $300 EVGA (NiVidia) GeForce GTX 950 just for this game. In shorter words, you're gonna have to pay more just to play this game at high quality experience.________________________________________________________________________________________________________There are plenty of cool cars and guns to this game. From cars, trucks, high end super cars, bikes, planes, boats, and other means of transportation offers you many choices to get from point A to point B. Guns are also pretty badass and some are pretty OP. Vehicle and Gun customization is also a great bonus. What I really personally liked was the drop top idea for convertibles. To me it gives me that nostalgia of Midnight Club: Los Angeles. The bikes, planes, boats, and other means of transportation is also a bonus.Sadly, once you drive all the sports cars and regular ones it gets boring to have them so you keep selling them off and buying different ones. And you're gonna be driving on street for the rest of your GTA Online because almost all missions, races, side challenges, heists, and gamemodes are all on land. Because of this it kinda makes a waste to own a boat or a plane (despite planes are good for getting around faster). I mean having a boat and plane is nice, but once you get the game you're really gonna get into bikes and vehicles (cars, trucks, exotics, etc.).________________________________________________________________________________________________________NOW, here's where more of your play time is going to last. GTA Online is a success honestly. The fact that you can make your own character, explore the island, and build up your own life is pretty rad. Having your own car collection, creating a crew, working for CEO, missions, races, varied gamemodes (Rockstar created and community created), and more. Honestly from playing GTA Online a while back it was such a blast with my friends, Once you connect with them it gets better because you can go with a crew anywhere. Hell, you can even roleplay with your friends on GTA Online.NOW, the downsides. The majority of the GTA Online players are downright cocky, offensive, and useless. You can't go to any GTA Online public session without seeing an argument of either ""in-game ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t"", unfair play, or just plain anger.Almost everybody gets mad in GTA for small things. People even accuse you for ""hacking"" on just killing them. Also because of the CEO update. People kick you out the lobby JUST so that they can do their own CEO missions. And they honestly won't ingore you and leave you to be. Another thing, because of people in GTA Online from unfair play, if you drive around out of nowhere someone is going to come after you for NO REASON and start killing you. They will even blow up your car, no joke. And even if you play Passive Mode from entering a lobby, people are gonna start♥♥♥♥♥♥talking you just for having it on. It's so bewildering but I tend to ignore.Also GTA Online's NPC players have god-like aim on hard difficulty, very annoying. as well. The problem here is that you have to grind the game so hard just to get a certain vehicle, boat, apartment, and plane. It's ridicluous!! It's so bad that you really NEED a Shark Card for buying this stuff on GTA Online, which is even more money you have to pay for just to get the best out of GTA Online. It's either you get sucked in, playing the game for hours and days just to get millions of dollars or spend another $10 - $60 dollars just for in-game money!!!Also from what I've been hearing as well, Rockstar Support is terrible. You can search up on the internet and you'll get many headlines saying Rockstar Support is bad. So please, be aware if you get banned or have a glitch in GTA Online.________________________________________________________________________________________________________In conclusion, GTA V is a great game, exellent game actually. There's still plenty of surprising updates to come. However Rockstar is leaning towards getting your money just to play the game and not dealing with other issues of the game. GTA Online sucks you in to all the trouble, hate, cringe, and issues that goes on. So beware buying this game.Online is now confirmed full of hackers/modders. It's now rare to find a lobby without hackers so good luck ever finding one. If you want to avoid hackers but still wanna play with randoms, start up an Invite Only session and once you start the mission then start inviting people. Also singleplayer is still average (not bad, but not great) so I don't need to say anymore about it."

So please, be aware if you get banned or have a glitch in GTA Online.________________________________________________________________________________________________________In conclusion, GTA V is a great game, exellent game actually. There's still plenty of surprising updates to come. However Rockstar is leaning towards getting your money just to play the game and not dealing with other issues of the game. GTA Online sucks you in to all the trouble, hate, cringe, and issues that goes on. So beware buying this game.Online is now confirmed full of hackers/modders. It's now rare to find a lobby without hackers so good luck ever finding one. If you want to avoid hackers but still wanna play with randoms, start up an Invite Only session and once you start the mission then start inviting people. Also singleplayer is still average (not bad, but not great) so I don't need to say anymore about it."

When I once had a modder dropping cash on my charakter, I left the lobby, went ahead and created a ticket, asking the support to delete the cash (around 100k) that was dropped by the modder, and guess what? Nothing happened.But now, for whatever reason, Rockstar decided to take a huge dump on me, a loyal and very legitimate player, who has bought and played E-V-E-R-Y single GTA game that exists.That's not how you treat your customers, Rockstar. You seem to only be focused on making money by selling Shark Cards these days.

Shame..."
285,40.7,Not Recommended," June 15, 2017",9,"This game sucks.Grand Theft Auto 1 and 3 are great classic Rockstar games, but for Grand Theft Auto V, the game designers obviously were not thinking straight. At first it seems like a pretty decent game, a little different from the first in the series but, that's okay. San Andreas was different from the first, Vice City was different, but they were all good.The first thing that's strikingly different is the fact that you have to go through Los Santos, talk to people and buy stuff. I never really minded that, it makes it a little more like an adventure story and it's kinda like SA, so that's okay. But the first problem comes in when it changes from day to night.(Cops chase you.)Why does this need to happen so often? Like, every five minutes? Why does it take so long? Nobody feels like sitting through this every time. How would you like it if you were playin' a game and then every five minutes I came over, made cops chase you, then counted ten tedious seconds, and then let you continue to play the game?Now, I mean, why did they think that that would be a good idea and interrupt the game play, did they think it would be more realistic? I mean, in real life I don't have to stop in my tracks when the sun sets and a ♥♥♥♥in' helicopter doesn't pop up in the air. I mean, this is one of the most annoying features in any game ever. What's the point? Yeah, I mean, the cops are stronger at night and the stores are closed, but why's that necessary and why does the game have to stop? It's ♥♥♥♥in' ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.And why do you have to die when you get arrested? That's the stupidest thing I've ever seen. This guy can go all over fightin' hordes of evil civilians, but he can't even have his rights read to him?Sometimes I don't feel like goin' down the highway just to get down to the Richman, I mean, there's no reason I should have to do that when I can just take a shortcut and pick Franklin. But, oops! I shouldn't do that, there might be cops down there.Another thing that's really annoying about this game is the fact that you have to buy weapons and haircuts. I mean, still, that's not uncommon, you know like I said: that's the same thing you have to do in many great games, like SA, but, lemme explain.Here you have to collect dollars, which count as money. I mean, that's kinda odd, because usually dollars count as life or energy, y'know, so that's kinda strange. But, y'know that's not the point. The point is that the haircuts you need to buy are too ♥♥♥♥in' expensive, and the dollars don't add up enough. It takes too long to get enough of them to buy something, and it gets boring wandering around killing the same civilians over and over again just so you can buy an afro or somethin'.Speaking of afro, that's pretty weird itself, isn't it? I mean, they were really being creative with that one, the afro.Anyway, about the dollars: It takes too long to buy stuff, and, to add onto the problem, when you die, you lose all your dollars and you have to start all over again. I mean, doing this doesn't add to any of the games' difficulty or challenge, it just makes us have to do more of the same monotonous stuff over again, and it's not fun, it's boring.Oh, look, I finally got enough dollars to go and buy a car that I need to cross the highway, now let me get to the store.(It changes to night in-game.)Oh♥♥♥♥♥♥ it's ♥♥♥♥in' night time, now the stores are all closed and I have to wait for it to turn day again. Oh well, I might as well kill some civilians in the meantime and stock up on some more money.(The character in-game gets arrested and dies.)OH♥♥♥♥♥♥ Now I gotta start all over again.One of the worst things in the game are the sidewalks, which are areas where there's, like, pedestrians or people that look like you could walk past them, but instead you just get beat up. It's impossible to tell where these spots are the first time walkin' through, so you just have to keep throwin' fists all over to see where they are. It's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Why should I have to do that? Again, it doesn't add up to any of the fun, y'know, challenge of the game. It's just unfair and it's annoying.In the nightclubs, there's no bosses at the end, which is a big disappointment. Every Rockstar gamester knows that at the end of a level or a nightclub, whatever, there's always supposed to be a big guy who ya fight. But here, they just got lazy and only put a few bosses in the game and left some of the clubs just empty like this one. So, most of the buildings you go through (the Dungeon Crawler, to be exact), there's nothing at the end except for a phone call that you can't skip.In the rest of the GTA games the tradition goes like this: You fight a boss, you defeat 'im, then a phone call comes down and you listen to it, there you go, on to the next level. But in GTA V, how would you ever figure out that you're supposed to throw a grenade at that call? I mean, when you first get the grenade you assume it's a weapon, and you throw it, only to find that it does absolutely nothing, and that you waste it by throwing it, so you have to get it all over again.There are parts in the game that are definitely not self-explanatory, and are too hard to figure out. Take this dead end for example: Would you guess that you're supposed to pass through this airport? How? You have to kneel down by it for like ten seconds. Now, still, that's not enough to make it so cryptic and hidden that we can't figure it out, oh please, give us more for our buck and make it harder so we can wander around the whole game and exhaust every possibility before we find out. Okay. Guess what? You need to have a Sawed-Off Shotgun selected, and be kneeling down, and wait a little while before this magic phone call comes and takes you to the next part of the game.Most of the townspeople have things to say which aren't important at all, so why do you have to hear 'em? Here, in the stores, there's books that you may find which actually give you clues about things in the game that you may need to know about. But, when I find these books, half the time it's by accident, so I may hit the button and cancel it out which means I don't even get to read it and I don't have a second chance.Why can't I do that when it changes from day to night?

They fixed their epic fail of not having anti aliasing, which was something that made GTA IV look bad.I actually recommend this game but I don't want to give it a ""yes"" because that would be like saying ""everything is okay, you don't need to fix anything"" - when there is major problems that wouldn't take much effort to fix. Don't let that metacritic score of 96 / 100 fool you, if they actually reviewed public multiplayer in that, it'd be more like 50 / 100. If I was a critic I would personally give it 1 / 100 because the effort put into the anticheat isn't just terrible, it's insulting.The below issues are all about multiplayer, because singleplayer is virtually flawless compared to multiplayer.- Cheaters are able to create explosions at your position and kill everyone in the game and it doesn't even show who killed you. I have seen community made mods for GTA SA with anti cheat literally 100x better than this. This one point alone makes public freeroam unplayable.- Was driving along then suddenly a hacker attaches a vault door to me, and I have some weapons that I didn't have before, knowing them they'll ban me instead of the actual hacker (they didn't but I've heard this happens). If a hacker can give remote players weapons that is utterly pathethic programming and which puts me at risk of getting banned for something completely out of my control.- Some hacker was able to warp the entire server to 1 location and obviously we all got blown up a second later. Again this is some utterly pathethic programming if a remote player can change your position.- It's possible to get banned for an unstated reason when you did nothing wrong, happened to a friend on their first day of playing and no they weren't cheating.- Very rarely, chat messages are not received by remote players which makes you think they're ignoring you. Probably due to them being sent P2P.- Opposes community multiplayer mod makers yet has no problem with all the constant cheating on public freeroam, which we have to use to play half the missions in the game.- 4 player heists that can be completely ruined by someone quiting, especially if they're no longer even required for completion. I've seen someone quit when were were 5 seconds away from completing a 15 minute mission. Then we get nothing...- Can't enter vehicle as passenger if there's no driver, though this exists for MC president and business CEO's there's no reason why holding F can't work for everyone.- Can't disable / remove weapons so have to cycle through useless guns to get to the good guns which is especially annoying when in a vehicle and it always starts you of with a rubbish weapon.- Joining online games is a lot slower than it should be, especially annoying when combined with getting kicked after 2 minutes of idle.- Players getting almost invincible tanks or APC and deathmatching with them in freeroam, even spawn killing outside buildings when you exit them, then they keep killing you over and over and you have almost no chance at stopping them.- Game often starts in windowed mode, would be very annoying if I didn't know about alt + enter fix.- Animation when entering vehicle freezes often in multiplayer.- I was in passive mode modifying my vehicle when some troll killed the mod shop guy, preventing me from being able to mod my vehicle. Passive mode is meant to prevent players ruining my experience.- High level players shouldn't be put in freeroam with newer players. Minigun vs pistol isn't fair.- Going to huge efforts for a CEO or MC mission which you're forced to play on public only to have some random level 500 player with a fighter jet destroy your objective and they actually get paid for ruining your mission and if you manage to kill them they become a sore loser and will hunt you down for the next 10 minutes. Or some cheater will just blow up the whole lobby.- You can sprint while aiming sniper rifle, in multiplayer you'll see players rapidly moving left and right while somehow managing to head shot you.- As if the game isn't slow enough to load they force us to watch 30 seconds of intro and legal crap, causing the whole world to lose thousands of hours of time.- Ridiculously super overpowered super expensive vehicles that have ruined missions for me daily like a motorbike that can fly and fire heat seeking rockets every second. Only cheaters can afford all this stuff or you pay £30.99 for a shark card that will just pay for this one overpowered thing. But why would anyone want to support a company which insults it's own customers by allowing blatant cheaters to ruin the game.- 'Join friends' saying no game found when I know for a fact there is a game to join because it works if I click 'join' in friends list.- Game telling me to press a key to do something when that key doesn't even do what it says.- If someone says ""Rockstar"" I see ""********"" I can only imagine that's because when people say that word, they have something bad to say about it. Then again you could consider your own company to be an insult the way it treats legitimate players.Because there's times I feel like ""this is the best game I've ever played"" and then times I feel ""this is the worse game I've ever played"" I award GTA V with the most amazing yet most flawed game ever."

To be honest, I spent more time than I should haveThis game was pretty fun when I played with 4 or more people, fun to goof around in when there's not modders teleporting you around and killing you. Unfortunately though, that's all this game is. Modders doing whatever they want and ruining the fun for everyone else because Rockstar would rather put out more DLC that = more revenue than fix the current content and create an actual working anti-cheat system.My fun ended abruptly. Why? Because someone decided to teleport to me and drop me $3,000,000 in less than a minute and instead of looking into who dropped it, rockstar decided to ban me. My ticket to ask why I was banned is still ignored to this day.Some major issues I ran into in this game:>It's literally a paper bag draped over a computer monitor so they never have to look at the horrid system they've invented>When you're banned, it can't be undone, which means if you've been banned, sucks for you>I was hoping it was just a glitch with certain systems, but nope. Every single person is guarenteed to constantly run into a problem where their screen just goes black and nothing is loading. You can't tell of course, since that's the default loading screen>Are you trying to have fun? HAH you just got teleported across the map and forced into the animation of being railed by a dog>Prices for anything in this game are ridiculous. You pay 1.5 mil for a car that's going to get blown up in one homing launcher shot>I'm sorry, but everyone is horrible on GTA Online. If you're having fun, it's their job to ruin your fun. I've only met like 3 friends in my year of GTA Online, and everytime I played with them our fun was ruined by either modding or BLACK ENDLESS LOADING SCREENS>Rockstar is aware of the new mod menu that allows people to spam reports on someone's account until they are automatically banned. But instead of confronting the issue they are choosing to delete any chats made about it, deny anything, and remember to send the ""There's no refunds to shark cards after you're banned"" automated messages out. Keep in mind, once you're banned, the account is wiped automatically. Even if you're not guilty, Rockstar doesn't care, they got their money from you alreadyThese are the reasons I give this game the lowest rating it can recieve and hope others do the same"

It could be even a virus on your pc. It could be unrelated to even gta 5.Why i have come to this conclusion is because i have gotten all the above, never modded tho, but i have recieved modded money and heck i even glitched a bit of cash, so why the hell am i not banned somehow, but my friend is getting banned who has not done any of the above?

If a few million GTA$ gave you access to most of the content back in 2015, nowadays you would need to spend a hundred times that amount if you want to gain access to most of what GTA Online has to offer.Moreover, Rockstar have continuously failed to fix the modding problem that the hacking problem that the Online world has been facing since the game's launch and have instead decided to ban everyone, be it hackers or victims sticking to a judge, jury and executioner type of mentality, where the wronged party has no real chance of winning an appeal due to Rockstar's terrible customer support.As if all of that was not enough, Take Two Interactive, Rockstar's parent company has decided to go after the single player modding community, shutting down OpenIV, the tool behind most of the GTA mods for almost a decade."

Only a pathetic automated answer claiming I had gotten the ingame money illegitimately.I'm not a modder, I haven't recieved money from modders, and I rarely play in a public room unless it's with my friends doing a sale. If I play in a public room, it's a solo public room with my friends who are also not modders. If I were going to mod money in the game, I wouldn't mod in such an insignificant amount like 600,000. To top it off, the money removed from my account was an extremely specific number such as 637,210. I had recently gotten this exact number from doing a sale online. Essentially, they made that sale useless. I rarely make 600,000 in this game much less 1 million.5 minutes of research proves I'm not the only one who had legitimate money removed, and the amount I had removed pales in comparison to the amount that was removed from others such as millions. Yes, I'm aware that some of these money adjustments were done because players had recieved illegitimate money from modders, but many like myself were done to people who earned cash legitimately. The fact that they won't correct this nonsense is unnaceptable and proves just how greedy they are, as if we needed any more proof.Even though the amount of money removed from my account wasn't massive, I shouldn't have had any money removed at all, and the way Rockstar has handled this whole situation will forever leave a bad taste in my mouth."

This has made me really angry, because I have been grinding really hard just to get robbed by rockstar under the claim that this money was not earned legitimately. If they were to take the time and look at the game records they could see that this was all money earned through sales of ingame business. I suspect that they are going around and taking money from players that have over a certain amount without the procurement of a shark card and saying we are cheating. Additionally what is to stop them from doing this to me and other again in the future. This is it I’m out and will not be buying, supporting any future Rockstar games and endeavors.

2,45.6,Recommended," November 28, 2015",1,"Grand Theft Auto V is an open world action adventure game developed by Rockstar North. This game is the fifteenth in the series. The game was originally released on Xbox 360 and PS3 in mid-2013, and then got a remastered version on Xbox One and PS4 in late 2014, before finally being released on the PC in April 2015. The game quite rightly is a record setter, selling over 11 million copies and grossing over $800 million on the release day, before breaking the $1 billion marker three days afterwards.GTA V continues in tradition with the type of game play on offer. You play in third person over the shoulder view of the characters. The game has three main protagonists, who each have their own story and plot to go with them – somehow all three of these characters’s path cross throughout the game and they soon become key to each other’s story. The driving in the game has been improved over the previous versions of the game, cars feel even more realistic to drive and the game’s physics engine is almost perfect with figuring out how objects will react should you hit them (or they hit you!). The gun play in this game is significantly better than the previous versions also, I did have issues with aiming and general fight scenes before, but GTA V sets out the controls and feel of the gameplay perfectly allowing you to not run into any stumbling blocks in terms of the controls or mechanics. I did find the flying missions to be quite annoying at times, since I was playing the game on mouse and keyboard, I found the controls to be a bit fumbly when manning a helicopter or plane, but the flying parts of the game are few and far between. The main core of the game revolves around completing story missions for each of the three main characters; these can range from stealing cars for a billionaire’s collection, right the way to robbing banks. There is plenty of variety in the missions you can do, and you will find it very difficult to find a moment in this game where you are bored.The game has gorgeous graphics, no they aren’t photo realistic, but that’s because the game’s style isn’t aiming for that. The PC version of this game is most certainly the pinnacle of gaming; it just puts the console’s version to shame when you compare the two. My rig which is a monster, couldn’t handle putting the game out at 60 fps at 4k resolutions, but was quite happy to run every setting at maximum on 1080p, and it just looks fantastic. Normally open world games try to reduce the graphics slightly just because how much is being loaded at any one time, but GTA V does none of that; each of the textures are all high res, animation is absolutely perfect, and the lighting effects are some of the best I have seen in any video game.As with all GTA games, you are going to get a blockbuster style story line, this is one of the best, if not THE best plot to any video game and one which I will remember. All three of the character’s story are so well written, and perfectly intertwining with each other. The game does have a large amount of cut scenes at the beginning of each level, some people may find this to be annoying as they would rather be playing the story rather than watching it; but personally I found the cut scenes to be just as interesting to watch as it is to play the game. They fully immerse you into the world of Los Santos. Not only is there a captivating main story to the game, there are also plenty of side missions whilst they are all quite basic tasks for you to complete, they all have some sort of story behind them for each character, which are all well worth your time in completing.The sound effects and voice acting goes above and beyond here as well. Every single one of the characters is so perfectly voice acted that you sometimes forget that these aren’t real people in front of. The ambiance sounds of the city are all amazing too, there is never a moment where there is just silence, whether it is people in the street chatting to each other, or someone getting road rage, there is always something going on. Not to mention the game has 162 songs on the radio station, so you will always find something you are in the mood for when you are traveling across the map.The game isn’t exactly hard, there are missions which you will probably have to do over again because of silly reasons, such as crashing your plane from not being able to land it (I have had to do one of the missions way too many times to remember because of this!!), but I don’t think I actually died in a gun fight or a heist of any kind, since most of the time you are with one of the other characters you always have some kind of backup should things turn nasty.Los Santos is one of the biggest game worlds to ever be made, it is bigger than GTA IV, GTA SA and Red Dead Redemption combined. Whilst a good portion of the map is mountain ranges and open fields of emptiness in the northern regions, the actual city is a bustling hive of entertainment and action. Round every corner there is something for you to do, whether it be a side missions that involves you getting your mother the drugs she needs, helping a young lady get her purse back after being robbed (or not?) or just earning an honest day’s work by towing cars that are parked illegally. The world is your oyster in Los Santos.The main story with a good portion of side missions and extras in GTA V took me just about forty six hours to complete. Whilst the main story is complete, I still have plenty of heists, extra missions, stunts, races…so much more to finish! The single player alone in this game can probably hit the heights of eighty hours if you want to complete everything, and it is something I am going to be aiming to do over the course of the next few months. Never have I played a game that has made me want to do that more! Having only played the game through once, I cannot be 100% sure on this, but I feel there is a slight portion of the game which can change depending on what actions you take towards the latter stages of the story so if you do want to replay the game again, there is going to be a bit of a different story at the end of it depending on what you choose.Technically, GTA V is faultless. Many worried that the PC port would be terrible, but they really knocked it out of the park here. The abundance of graphical options, audio options, and options in general, really make this a proper PC game. The game can be played on a gamepad, or a mouse and keyboard. Normally with GTA games I opt for the game pad, but the game is so well optimized for the PC, the mouse and keyboard feel like the only option for me - it just plays so fluidly.I am going to go out on a limb here and say that GTA V is one of, if not the greatest video game out there today. There is absolutely nothing wrong with the game, and it excels in every area in which you will critic a game. The stellar gameplay, exquisite story line, and huge open world for you to explore; it is hard to put this conclusion into words as to how perfect this game is – it is something you really need to be experiencing for yourself as this is a piece of history right here.1) Stay away2) Not Recommended3) Only recommended when on sale4) Recommended5) Highly recommendedIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

If you're looking for a good online game then you are not in the right place.This online experience has alot to offer and a great potential, but after that many years rockstar still didnt make it to work normally.If you're playing with your friends then you're good to go, you will be able to do the heists like a normal person.If you don't have friends that own the game this is what you're going to experince playing online :Heists - you will barely be able to do them, why ?! because 95% of the players will disconnect while you play because they don't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about you.Out of the so many hours I was playing gta online, I promise you guys that 75% of the time I was waiting in lobbies for players to connect, for leaders to press ""START"" or just waiting for the messiah to give me normal people to play with.YEAH FREAKING 75% OF MY TIME PLAYING THIS GAME WAS IN LOBBIES WAITING FOR SOMETHING TO HAPPEN !!!!!NO WAY YOU CAN DO THE HEISTS CHALLANGE WITHOUT GOOD BUDDIES AND NORMAL PEOPLE WITH BRAINS."

As the publisher in question wasn't making enough money from the 4th best selling game of all time and forcefully pushing people into GTA online content by blocking off access to vehicles for single player etc. (I have purchased this game 3 times on 3 separate platforms), they have decided to further alienate its huge PC modding playerbase just to squeeze out a few extra dollars from the ridiculous fee to play cash card system. Absolute disgrace to your modding community and PC player base take two, you ought to be ashamed. Especially take two CEO, Strauss Zelnick, who only two weeks ago at an investors conference was talking about how he could take more money from our pockets without us realising. Disgusting."

130,414.7,Recommended," April 20, 2015",42,"While the PC version of this outstanding game is new, it's been out long enough on consoles that I don't need to go into every single thing about the game so I'll just sum up what I personally like, (ALOT) and don't like (Not too much).Likes:-The EnvironmentAn insane amount of detail has been paid to recreating parts of L.A. (L.S.) to near perfection. Having been to the actual city several times, I could easily recognize landmarks and accurate streets while in game. The Viper Roorm, Ripley's Believe It or Not museum, The Scientology Center are all here plus lots more albeit renamed but the structures remain the same.When the sun sets and rises, all of the lighting is accurate and at times, absolutley beautiful especially when the light rays are breaking around Mt. Chiliad and when storms roll through the desert or in the cities, it's some of the best weather FX I've seen in a game because it feels real. Roads gradually get wetter the more it rains and lightning illuminates everything when it crashes.It truly feels like a living world.-The SatireWhat I feel is one of the strongest points of the game is how it shows no mercy towards the vapid lifestyle that's so prevalent in L.A. across all social classes. The rich are just as shallow as the poor in their life goals and in a very cathartic and some would say sadistic way, it's never been more fun to mow down socialite trash in the hills or go on a rampage down in the ghetto.The signage and radio commercials are also perfect, knocking everything from politics to the video game industry itself. This can keep a person driving around just looking at billboards and movie posters and listening to the varied radio stations.-The CharactersThere are many who dislike the characters, especially Trevor and I can see why but I liked them because of how they played off of one another. Michael, the would be retiree who's juggling family problems. Franklin, a young man growing up in the hood, doing what needs to be done but also having some kind of conscience and a want to get out of his current lifestyle. Trevor, the manic fiend throws all caution to the wind and is the vulgar but free spirit, taking pride in his insanity but also has some insightful moments along the journey.None of the characters generate any real kind of sympathy but they're all believable and kept me wanting to play to see how things end up for each of them. The voice actors do an A+ job in bringing them and the secondary characters to life.-The First Person ModeNot only is this one of the best 3rd person games ever made, it's also one of the best FPS's in years. Being able to take in the entirety of the world and action through the eyes of each character really brings the world to life and the shooting is super smooth in both 3rd and 1st person modes.-The Radio StationsThere's nothing like blasting through neighboorhoods or driving off cliffs while rocking ""We Built This City"" by Starship or ""Heartbeat"" by Don Johnson. If you like pop, rock, country, rap, trance or even talk radio, there's something here for anyone to like.Dislikes:-The PoliceThey seem overly aggresive and I don't know if that's a play on the LAPD or not but there have been time that I've simply pointed a gun at someone and got swarmed by 4 cop cars in less than 5 seconds. Also while in a car, I've been clear of their field of view with no chopper in the air and parked in the most secluded hiding spot I could find only to have them pinpoint my location and jump the walls to get me.-The StorefrontsI just wish there were more of them that could be entered and explored but I also know how much of a challenge this would be in an already huge world. I'd be happy if they would have an arcade somewhere with a few playable classic games.-The Sub and the HelicopterFor me, the sub missions are the biggest weakness in story mode. The model looks cool but is just dull and not much fun to drive and thankfully main missions with it are few. The helicopter, while fun, could have the controls refined a bit more to make it more fluid especially when trying to pinpoint certain targets. Thankfully Rockstar is fairly lenient when it comes to this.-Real Time DestructionAgain, like the storefronts, I know how much it would take to have this throughout the world and we'd probably be lucky to get 10-30 frames per second with Phys-X cranked up but it would be a sight to behold bringing down one of the contruction sites or collapsing an overpass at will. Something about shooting a rocket at a building and only leaving scuff marks really removes me from the game in those moments.-Extra ActivitiesGiven the sun and sand vibe of L.S.(L.A.), I wish that you could surf and skateboard. Seeing a skateshop as well as a skatepark and half pipes and only being able to ride them with a bmx bike left me slightly gnashing my teeth.That's not to say they couldn't add these things in a dlc pack, (fingers crossed) but I just find theior absence strange and overlooked.Those nitpicks aside, this is still one of the best games I've played in a very long time and, with so much to do, I'll be playing it for the rest of the year and beyond and smiling the whole time.Overall Score: 9 out of 10"

141,"1,743.0",Recommended," August 8, 2015",50,"Honestly, what can I say about Grand Theft Auto V that hasn't already been said? I enjoyed my time in Los Santos just as much as anyone else although I feel that there's so much to praise and criticize Rockstar on with this product that all of it can't fit inside the confines of this review.Aspects of Grand Theft Auto V Worth Praising● Interesting Selection of Licensed Music. It wouldn't be a Grand Theft Auto title without a wide range of unique music to listen to, would it? You certainly have to give credit to Rockstar for their unique selection of licensed music in their game!● The Introduction of The Rockstar Editor. Not many developers have ever took the time to create a content creation tool such as the Rockstar Editor. This tool provides seemingly limitless opportunities for videos and screenshots.● The Ability To Approach Combat Situtations In Multiple Ways. You have stealth mechanics, silencers, fragmentation mines and sticky bombs along with the ability to use your weapons while parachuting at your disposal.● The Ability To Add Custom Music Via Self Radio. Although Grand Theft Auto V doesn't give you any way to listen to your music on-foot, you at least have the ability to add your own custom songs just as in previous titles through Self Radio.● The Feature To Replay Missions. In previous Grand Theft Auto titles you had no way to re-experience missions once you've completed them. This time around Rockstar has implemented the feature to replay missions! It allows you to re-experience mission and aspire towards a 100% gold rating through weapon accuracy and various mission specific objectives.● In previous Grand Theft Auto titles the only way you could save was to go to your safehouse or apartment. This time around you can quick save straight through your phone!● Grand Theft Auto V offers hundreds of unique articles of clothing including hats, earings, glasses, armor, shirts, pants, shoes and a multitude of other accessories to customize your online character with.● You can't purchase car insurance, call for vehicle delivery for your vehicles or purchase apartments in single player. If you take your car out on a mission or it gets destroyed, it's gone forever.● The ""First Person On Foot Field of View"" slider isn't labeled in any way and is extremely narrow. There is way to increase your first person field of view in a vehicle.● Unfortunately, it's always been this way in every Grand Theft Auto title. This leads people to favor motorized vehicle transportation and procrastinate longer than they should as they don't want to leave the vehicle they're in. For a game that takes place in 2013 you would think you have the ability to purchase a pair of earbuds at the gas station and use your phone to listen to the radio or purchase music with in-game money on an iFruit app, but no.● There is no way to skip the introduction in the beginning of the game and it's locked to 30 frames per second. Most don't mind waiting 30 or more seconds every time they start the game but all of those seconds certainly stack up, especially if your game crashes often. As for the frame rate restriction, the only limitation that should affect a loading screen's performance should be your hardware but that unfortunately isn't the case in Grand Theft Auto V. Some people can't handle going from 80, 120, 144 or higher frame rates to 30.● When ever you first load into single player, switch characters or return from multiplayer, your character will have their clothes reset every time. Some don't care, but some inviduals painstakingly customize their character only to have it reset. This doesn't affect your online character however.● While Rockstar may continually increase the amount of items you can purchase with the money you earn, they don't bother themselves increasing the amount of missions you can earn money from. Not all missions are created equal so Grand Theft Auto V Online can turn into a grind fest very quickly.● Players are segregated based on their targeting mode preferences in the ""gamepad"" settings menu. Assisted Aim is set as default thus every other gamemode on any other preference is never full and players will constantly leave. You have to continulessly leave to find a new session and at times you'll randomly disconnect from everyone else.● On the 15th of June 2017 Take Two issued a cease and desist letter to the team at OpenIV essentially proclaiming modifications should be illegal. They've done this before with an alternate multiplayer service named FiveM.● Steam owners of Grand Theft Auto V can't play unless they're signed into a Rockstar Social Club account it's launched through Steam. These restrictions only affect people who have legally purchased this product.● Because everything you do online is tied to the Social Club service and not any sort of offline save file that you can backup for future use or load into individual user hosted servers, 10, 20, or 30 years from now when they're not raking in enough money to keep their servers afloat, all the ranks you achieved and money you earned or payed for would have been for nothing.● Instead of adding the feature to change your license plate in-game, Rockstar decided to outsource this feature to a third party app called ""iFruit."" This app is only available on Google Play, the Apple or Windows app store.● Those who were present during the multitude of exclusive events throughout the end of 2013 and 2014 on the console versions of Grand Theft Auto V were awarded exclusive weapons, vehicles and articles of clothing. It's debatable if you truly need to criticize Rockstar for doing this because to some it represents an appreciation for the alpha and beta testers of Grand Theft Auto V. For some, it's a painful pill to swallow knowing that there's items they're never going to be able to obtain because they either waited for the PC release or are a newcomer."

220,100.6,Not Recommended," November 24, 2015",98,"GTA V: a game that would be amazing... if it wasn't so plagued by it's own community.Speaking strictly in terms of online multiplayer, the game is infected. A solid 2 out of every 3 sessions has a miserable kid with a mod menu, endlessly spawning NPCs, fire, explosions, and other annoying entities on the players. And of course Rockstar introduced online challenges-- mini games which pit the players head-to-head to win a cash reward. Naturally, if you're close to winning, you'll be any modder's main target. This awful infestation of cheaters has made the game outright frustrating to play with others, something that GTA is meant to be about.Despite the unfortunate multiplayer environment, the game remains very solid in private sessions and singleplayer game modes. More unfortunately, however, is the fact that public multiplayer is the game mode most people want to play-- therefore I can't recommend this game in it's current, toxic state."

I didn't have any issues starting the game up.However, about two weeks after the release, I'm beginning to see problems. I haven't even been able to play the last two days, because the game crashes immediately after launch. I tried safe mode. Other problems include long♥♥♥♥♥loading times, and issues when connecting to other players playing heists.At this point I'd say you should wait until the majority of the launch problems and connection issues are fixed. Of course, they'll never be completely fixed, but I expect better from Rockstar. A couple days ago, in a patch, they even said this,""Fixed a rare issue where the Steam version of the game would crash right after launching.""Like I said, wait until launch and connection/server issues are atleast partially fixed. If you can't wait to buy it, then good luck.I will update this review as the game improves."

And I am sure it is a big bomb to all the GTA5 youtubers who maintain their lives with OpenIV mods also who enjoyed single player with mods after finishing the story. I don't think GTA6 will be another business boom without mods. So I assume that Take2 actually discarded their money destroyed one of the main features of the GTA series : modding and having fun until death in real life. And the new DLC is an actual piece of crap. Now all the mindless elementary kids who think they are somewhat bosses are now able to mess up the whole session with those retreded vehicles and stupid armoured clothes with burning bullets. After about 600 hours of playing, I learned how to deal with randomly killing noobs with a sniper gun and some other weapons. Of course I know how to make my own public session but it is now always possible to avoid people joining in my private session. And the set of new DLC contents costs more than the game actually costed me. This is just a crap. I miss the day the people did not have these cheat-like vehicles. And the game could be much better but there are only 5 heists, actually 4 because the fleeca job is just a joke. But seriously? I am 100% sure that there could be much more heists missions in this big map with various contents. Heists get so boring at some point. Please if you want to get more players, just make missions more interesting and various that people can enjoy doing missions almost forever. But the reality is : DLCs with bunch of stupid contents that cost 2M(12$) per item. tsk. seriously? And the shark cards cost too much. Back in the day, you could do a lot of things with 2M therefore a 12$ shark card could be considered worth the price but now, Just a small stupid flying bike costs 3M. And little garage thingy costs 2M,3M Did you already forget that we bought this game atleast for 25$ and up to about 60$? Please take managing game serious. And those of you who used mods to mess up people online should jump off the local bridges.

Mother f'er, I'M RICH! I'll simply drop a few hundred dollars in shark cards and I will just buy what I need! Hell, $500 in real money will buy you 40 million in game cash, enough to buy an office, a nice home, a car or two and Yacht, with maybe a little spending money to go around for things like bike and some fancy new duds.Reasons to NOT purchase this game:1) If you are looking for a compelling multiplayer experience... this ain't it sweetie. If you want to play in an environment of a truely caustic community than go ahead. It is filled with underaged griefers, hackers (aimbots, God Mode, one shot-instakill-rail guns in MP, moments where everyone on the server explodes at one) and every other hack imaginable. It is truely an awful place.2) You love to be rewarded for your labors...sigh, move along, nothing to see here. This game is a frigging grind, we are talking a Lee Dorsey kinda slog. WORKIN' IN A COAL MINE, GOING DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, WORKIN' IN A COAL MINE, GOING DOWN, DOWN, DOWN OOPS ABOUT TO SLIP DOWN... Want to buy a new lower end bike so you too can join a MC? Cool, buy in starts at $100,000. Sweet, just completed a mission for Lamar, nice! Here is your $5k, go forth and prosper, buy remember to stock up on the armor and ammo you used, but that's going to run you about $3000 to $15k if you like to use big bang bangs that go all explodey. WORKIN' IN A COAL MINE, GOING DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, WORKIN' IN A COAL MINE, GOING DOWN, DOWN, DOWN OOPS ABOUT TO SLIP DOWN... Buy a nice car, hope ya got a cool million.3) You have a PC that can not play Witcher 3 at 1080@60fps. Seriously, if you have anything less than a super high end gaming computer save yourself the hassle and skip it. If you love you some low resolution 30fps thunder than you just keep on keeping on you bad mofo, cuz this is the jam for you!All in all, its a pretty game with a fun single player component, but the MP is pure stage 4♥♥♥♥♥♥and balls cancer and the shark cards nonsense is nothing more than a ridiculous cash grab due to a completely purposefully screwed in game economy."

GTA V specifically, and Rockstar in general, are absolute garbage.This could be a fine game, but it's totally let down by a small community of modders and Rockstar's complete inability to do anything meaningful to stop them. At around 1:00 this morning, when I was tucked in and asleep in my bed, Rockstar, without provocation or reason, banned my account for 30 days and reset my character. If you think this can't happen to you, that your account will be safe because you don't cheat, I hate to break it to you but you are completely naive. I had 800 hours in game and never modded or used an exploit with my online account. I grinded out my money the hard way (maybe this is why Rockstar doesn't care what I think -- because I haven't bought into their overt attempts at pushing players to purchase shark cards). Rockstar is unable to stop modders and hackers so they resort to blaming victims. In typical Rockstar fashion, they won't even respond to my support tickets with anything beyond a form email saying that banned/reset accounts are not subject to appeal. Rockstar support never responded to me on Twitter. If you really want a laugh, try to find a phone number at which a human being who works for Rockstar can be reached.Rockstar will never get another dime of my money.

887,99.6,Not Recommended," June 15, 2017",8,"Honestly while I have had like 3 good times in GTA Online, and the game has an FPS mode that is really immersive thanks to some really well designed first person animations and a complete change in subtle control scheme to make it work great, the game is an unbalanced mess. It's got very high production value, you can see the budget that was put into this game before your very eyes, and there are some neat, fun touches in the single player campaign like Michael calling you when you rocket his house as trevor, but none of that matters when the game itself is actually quite boring.I thought about not leaving a review since steam only has upvotes and downvotes because this game is a solid 5/10. Like, flashy visuals, good character acting and large amounts of high tier development technology are appreciated and do contribute to making a game better but they still ultimately don't make a good game since they're all surface level quality. Just because you have a lot of things to do in a campaign doesn't mean they're all fun. In fact I think all of the animation budget they put into the game has actually affected the gameplay, since despite good somewhat punchy firearm sound design weapons feel floaty to use likely as compensation for the fact that there is a delay for turning thanks to the animation and controls focusing on realism first and responsive gameplay second. This is alleviated by going first person mode for the most part, but still very noticeable.In reality GTAV is somewhat of a slog. GTA Online seems deliberately grindy to get you to buy shark cards. The community is the worst one you'll ever see at times. The game gets old fast. But I could still leave a thumbs up despite all of that, were it not for mods being outlawed. This sets a dangerous precedent that should never be put in place.I cannot in good conscience recommend this game to anyone, like, not just because of this recent business with mods (That's a contributing factor though), but because the game seems to get worse with every update. There's more and more things, more and more controversies keep happening (for once not over the content but ♥♥♥♥♥♥ business practices, which is hilariously ironic because typically in the GTA series the opposite has been true; Ballad of Gay Tony and Lost & Damned for GTA 4 used to be prime examples of how to do DLC right.) and it all keeps making this game seemingly worse instead of better. Don't buy this. The PC port was appreciated even if it was 2 years late, but appreciating something doesn't mean you can't be critical of it."

However, I had 1.2 million of 100% legitimate money removed in game, this is nowhere near how much some people have had removed, this just shows what they're all about, after contacting them about this mistake, I received a generic copy/paste message as a response. Rockstar knows that removing money from people only affects us legitmate players, people using mods would use their mods to get their money back in a few seconds, not grinding for hours, even days like us legitmate players have to. They also absoulutely do not care enough to even respond to you. Their plan is that if they remove money from the online economy, then at least some of it will come back in form of shark cards, and that money just goes straight into their pocket. I hate to say this about a rockstar title, but they have made it this way... I STRONGLY recomend DO NOT BUY this game, it is obvious that this game is just a way to scam money from people, and it is extremely obvious that this is the case, other games make money while remaining honest. this is a major turning point for Rockstar, throwing your customers under the bus to make a quick buck will not fly well with people who have supported them all the way, through the bad publicity, and all, without their customers, they do not have a company, and they do not seem to care.

There are jerks who always left at the last minute, or left when the mission fail at the last checkpoint. Loading takes a toll of the time and each full heist could take like 2-3 hours, without any fail of course. Unless you are doing the first heist, which is the Flecca bank.- CEO Mission, also known as crates and vehicle mission.Forcing the players to go play in public session, whereby all the vehicles, truck, boats and airplanes could be blown very easily with any jerks using homing launchers. To make things worse, the connection stability is so terrible that any associates can get dc very easily, leaving the crates/cars exposed and destroyed in public. The reward for the associates was not interesting at all and many would not want to be part of it and waste time.-Biker DLCAgain, with businesses almost similar to CEO missions, just a little different whereby you need to wait for the production to be filled and then actually selling it. Issues were same as CEO missions as well, forced to join public, whereby 20+ jerks were waiting to fill you with frustrations, after hours of waiting for product completion upon spending efforts in resupplying each business.Rockstar should provide more flexible options to players instead of forcing players to go public and perform each missions.

81,672.8,Not Recommended," October 1, 2017",8,"TL;DR: Online is fun for 30 hours max, after that you need to grind or be rich. Singleplayer is really fun.I will preface with this: I enjoy the game, and the singleplayer is excellent. However, the main catalyst for rage on my part and one of the main selling points of this game is the online. My salt will be focused to bolster the claims and cries by other like minded gamers.When I say rage, I do not mean ""REEEE HACKER!"" I know I am awful at this (and many other) game(s). The online is a grind, and not a very short one. It is a very arduous as well as tedious journey to the top of the food chain. Now, you could either find a community to guide you there and make it somewhat bearable, however in this eventuality you end up grinding the same heist over and over again, close to five times a day to get anywhere. The alternatives include freeroam activities (which could be fun, more on that later) or doing missions with randoms, which in this game happen to for the most part be awful. I mean straight garbage. Your fourth and quite frankly final option if you hope to have fun after the first 30 hours of online (not incluiding singleplayer), you will purchase shark cards. IRL money to buy IG money. People will say this is optional, so it doesnt affect me. Keep in mind other people play this game, and opt to purchase the aforementioned cards.I neglected to divulge to you the content of these freeroam missions, so here goes. You can buy and office or biker clubhosue from which to stage your operation as either a luxury vehicle exporter and wholeseller of all manner of illicit merchandise, or a biker gang pushing drugs and running jobs as guns for hire. Either costs literal millions, close to 2mil to actually start earning anything exporting and around 1.5mil (dont take my word for it) for biker gangs. This sounds quite fun, and it is. For an hour apiece. Then it becomes boring, repetitive and easily exploitable. Oh, and might I add, you need to be in a public session, leaving yourself vulnerable to the *friendly* community of GTAV. How lovely. Now, you have established your presence and then begin to recieve numerous unrelenting calls about a new hangar, how this can expand your empire even further. Or, you see that you can purchase a bunker. You opt for either one, and lo and behold, same crap. Grind out boring, repetitive missions while you are being viciously maueld by various aircraft and the like.What you could do, is decide to cut your connection and quickly reconnect it in order to force yourself to be kicked from an open session into a closed solo session that counts as a public session. Simple exploit #1. You are welcome. Whats so bad about this? Well, it gets even more repetitive, though significantly less frustrating.Almost forgot, you could run monotonous jobs and missions that earn you meager cash rewards, and are simply difficult if you do not have the money to purchase good vehicles and missions. That and nobody plays anything. Good luck finding people.Edit: just edited for task completion"

A hacker joined and within 10 seconds had dished out millions of dollars in hacked cash to all of us. We didn't even know he was in the session until then.So, what do with the hacked money? You can't drop it and rockstar won't remove it for you. I sent them a support ticket immediately, they gave me a copy-pasted reply saying it'd be removed in one of their hacker sweeps. It did eventually get removed over a month later, after I'd been given many millions more in hacked cash without my consent and after new vehicles had been released that I wanted to buy. So yeah, I spent it. What else could I do other than just not play the game until it was removed?Anyway, they eventually did remove my hacked cash and charged a bit of my legit money for things I'd bought with the hacked cash. Okay, whatever. Fair enough.Just recently though when they announced the Smuggler's Run update, they did a couple more hacker sweeps. They took millions from my legit money, presumably for something bought with hacked money months ago. I feel like they took more than I ever spent in hacked cash, but that doesn't matter I guess. The real kick in the teeth here is that they did this after doing double $$ on bunker sales, and double $$ on vehicle cargo. People have of course been grinding those things like crazy to prepare for the new update.Sucking away millions of our legit money literally right after we'd been grinding the double $$ things like crazy is a huge ""F* YOU"" from Rockstar. You might say it's fair because it's taking money for previous illegitimate purchases, but remember that most people didn't ask for hacked cash. We didn't walk over money bags or enter dodgy missions. The hackers would literally desposit the money directly to your character, you had NO choice in the matter and Rockstar would not fix it for you.So all in all, f*** Rockstar and Take Two, and don't give them any of your money.A good game ruined by s*** business practices and lack of desire or ability to fix a colossal hacker problem.Oh but look on the bright side, there's a sale on shark cards!"

Even cash earned with the purchase of shark cards only days before.I haven't even played online for months, not since the Open IV/mods being removed fiasco, and I still had 95% of my cash removed from my online account because...?Well, I'm still waiting an answer on that. I think most of us are.This has become a pattern by now, where Rockstar does something silly/stupid, and it takes huge player-base outcry to even ellicit a response from them -- if we're lucky. And I'm just tired of being a part of it.And if you're looking to buy this game, you shouldn't be a part of it either. I'm not even joking or exaggerating when I say it's like being in an abusive relationship. In fact, that is exactly what it is. An abusive relationship between the game company and its consumers. And this is just Rockstar we're talking about here, not the rampant cheating that's going on still that will most certainly cause you problems as well.Now maybe you're just interested in the single-player. But the truth is that Rockstar no longer wants single-player to be GTA V's selling point, but online. So even if you want to just play single player, you will only at best be getting a very limited experience of what the game actually offers.The question is less a matter of ""is it worth the money or not?"" and more of a ""is it worth the trouble?""Is the game good? Yes. Yes it is.Is it worth the trouble? No. I'm afraid not."

66,"1,692.0",Not Recommended," June 15, 2017",8,"BEFORE YOU READ. It seems, that i've choosen a bad time to write an review, because at the moment everybody went crazy about mods situation. This review explains the whole situation, not just the mods one.(This is dedicated straight to the Online part of the game)I've played this game since fall 2015 and been trough 1000+ hours of gameplay. I really got mixed thoughts about this game. It was great at the beginning, but at it's lifetime it just got worse. I'd like to point some things outGameplay:The main idea of the whole gameplay is to become an criminal lord in the Los-Santos. Somewhere around the start of the game there was just contact missions (some folks just told you to go somewhere and shoot somebody ect.) and heists. But invest-money-businesses came after. I would be totally ok with that if some features would be purchasable without buying these ""businesses"" (special transport is a good example).Updates/DLCs:Thanks to Sharkcards donators every update is sort of free. But instead of selling an update as paid DLC, devs just put huge prices making players, which cannot afford some purchases, to donate real life money for in-game money (still better than paid DLC). I know, there are lots of ways to earn money in this game, but every single of them are coming to farming/grinding in conclussion.New content advertisment:Devs have a very interesting way to advert their updates. They just spamming ""BUY IT NOW"" in game tips, in-game phone and in-game email. Well, not literally, but if you're not interested in the new content, you don't have a choice to ignore it. It will annoyingly spam you with offers to buy it in every single way it's possible in this game.Servers:I don't have any ideas about servers quality on other platforms, but on PC they are just bad. Instead of good old server browser for PC platform we get completely random matchmaking system. If you want to join Online you just push one button and jumping straight into the loading screen, which can drop you in Singleplayer after minutes of loading. While loading you don't have any ideas where does matchmaking gonna drop you at. You can't choose where do you wish to go, to the empty or full session. Sometimes game can drop you into the Singleplayer right at the middle of Online gameplay. I didn't even mentioned disasterous server connection - long times to register kills, purchases or NPCs teleporting around.Loadings:As i already told - loadings are one of the main problem of the game. I dont know why this game has huge loading times. I would totally be ok with loadings too, but they're just everywhere. You choose session - loading. You start some gamemode - loading. You wait for a new gamemode round to begin - loading. You start heist/mission - loading. If you're playing with your friends, the game can even throw you around on random sessions sepereting you. And if you want to join up with your friends you have to go trough loadings again.Bugs and glitches:It's not a secret, that this game is filled with bugs, whatever they are abusable or not. Devs are seemed to not be interested in fixing them. At this point i can't understand them in any way. Once devs told that they support community if they're using harmless glitches to have fun (such as getting restricted clothing) and then devs are fixing them. They often got attention on glitches that community using for fun and fixing them, but not when it comes to the real ones such as losing connection, unlimited loadings or server connection problems ect.There is one bug with dissapearing helmets in the game, which devs sure were informed about and not fixing it for almost a year now. This one were the most annoying for me.Modding:Also a tricky part. A good part of the GTA V community is the modding guys. Some of the players are interested in this game because it can serve as a good modding platform (myself included). They're making unlimited amount of nice looking machinimas or artworks. Everything thanks to the mods. But at the time Take-Two are trying to kill modding community by banning some of the modding tools.But not every mod requires some complicated tools. Not some called ""mod menus"". You can often see people using these in Online (mods are actually not allowed in Online, if you're using one, you're risking to get banned). It would be ok if they're were just messing around with themselfes, but often they hurt innocent people by spawning them huge amount of money (which self-called anti-cheat system registers as hacking) and causing ban on both. Or they just can spam kills the whole session. Or even removing your hard earned cash or crashing the game (yes, they can crash your game).Performance:Optimization died with the game lifetime. Now it filled with unneeded sports cars and clothing reskins (which are in low-res for some reason). My PC settings are good enough play this game (even better than recommended), but i often meet with FPS drops or one second freezes now. Not even only me. My friends are suffering these too.Im just trying to say, that huge amount of content are pushing the game engine to the limit. Or something else is causing the troubles, then im not sure.But even if you never actually pay attention to the bad sides of the game, you can still have fun in it, since this game is sure has good something to offer to you. I wouldn't play this game for 1000+ hours if there wasn't any fun of it. This game granted me tons of good memories.TL;DR-Donate or you're left to farm money to enjoy new updates.-Poor server connection implementation.-Bugs are never getting fixed.-Ban risk.-Performance troubles.-Still possible to enjoy the game if you ignore every single problem.-Not recommended to buy at current state."

398,"1,076.3",Recommended," November 4, 2017",8,"First bought this game on PS4 and bought a PC just to play it again but with better graphics and a higher frame rate. Story is great and there's plenty of stuff to do but Online is where there's the most replayability. Many hours of things to spend your time on in Online and many new vehicles to get. I like the continued support for the game but of course there is some negative aspects too, such as the increasing amount of cheaters and the prices of vehicles is getting a little too expensive. There's a lot of grinding involved these days just to get what you want, so unless you have many hours of free time you're pretty much limited to buying shark cards or making a friend that owns it all who'll let you try it.If I were to judge the game entirely based on the single player, I would recommend it since the graphics are great and the story and music are also great.If I were to judge it just on the Online alone, I would have to give it a mixed review. Online was great around the Heists time but ever since then things have just been getting too expensive while the payouts of jobs have stayed the same. There are also many cheaters in the game and I've recently been finding one in every single session. These people can drop money on you which can be detected and get the money removed or if it keeps happening your account can get suspended and they also have access to every player's IP address which I know first hand because someone got angry at me so decided to post mine in the public chat where 28 other people could see it.Rockstar do seem to sometimes ban these cheaters but a lot of times it's ineffective considering they can just buy cracked accounts and use an updated cheat that doesn't get detected."
121,271.0,Recommended," August 10, 2016",8,"tl;dr: Don't buy if you're not prepared for a cancerous community.Singleplayer:By far the most interesting / close to best story on grand theft auto I've ever played, a 2nd place right after San Andreas, The whole 3 Character feature really does please most players with different tastes, I myself as a big fan of San Andreas found most fun playing Franklin, occasionaly going to Grove st. and such and I can see how 'maining' a certain character can change and better your gameplay experience. Just be wary when reinstalling to fix a bug or such, I did so and ended up losing my 82% Completion save file which Rockstar nor Steam could help with since they dont save your files in online.Multiplayer: holy sh*tLet me begin with the actual fun parts of Multiplayer:You want to be an elite bank robber ?- You can play multiple bank heists with lester the molester and earn a quick buckYou want to steal valuable information about military grade weapons and break people out of prison?- You can work for a guy known as Agent 14 And do exactly that and ♥♥♥♥ over a private military known as MerryweatherYou want to put all of that♥♥♥♥♥♥to the side and do some good old gang related missions?- Lamar is your man, call him and you'll get enough work such as starting gang battles, stealing lowriders and ambushing gangs in their neighborhoods, parking lots and even funerals.Bored of the missions?-Races, Deathmatches, All sorts of events, You can even have fun just playing in free mode with a friend and do all sorts of things.Sounds pretty amazing doesn't it? Well It's far from amazing.The people rating negative are all complaining about being banned for nothing , but when I go into a random lobby 2/10 lobbies actually have people modding and going invincible, spawning anything from tanks, jets, to ♥♥♥♥in' wind mills infront of your house, if it's not that then it's some russian kid and a french dude screaming at each other over the mic.So after all of that you go to the escape menu and try to find a new session right? Well if you're from EU have fun sitting in a loading screen for at least 2 minutesWant to play by yourself? Have fun getting kicked out of heists for your low level and getting completely destroyed in death matches or any other kind of mode by a chinese guy thats level 8000 and is playing with over 200 ping, or a modder that screams in your ear the whole time you play and you have to spend half of the time actually trying to figure out his name.Also they try to sell multiplayer by giving you a ""wide"" selection between characters, which is partly true, if you want to look like a Niko bellic with some kind of syndrome. Everybody walking around has the same face and most of them have the same haircut, and they're either in some crap like a suit and sweat pants or an edgy full tactical team outfit Who drive around in their armored cars and do nothing but kill people and go into passive mode after.Overall, The game is good, but the community and character customization and multiplayer in general has a far, far way to go."

No pay2win, people in jets had to actually go out and get them (so less people generally got in them), money could be made after a while, was rewarding.Once they started releasing things that greatly overpowered people who had money (such as the flying, rocket propelled motorcycle that shot missles), it started to get annoying. Jets could now be bought that allowed any idiot to just jump in one and go around killing pople. Shark cards were pushed further, grinding got more boring than ever, R* started banning for no reason what-so-ever.The last straw for me was the orbital cannons. People can now just sit in an underground bunker with millions of dollars (either bought or got through modding), and kill you instantly. Within seconds, you're dead. Really no way to stop it since you don't know when it's going to happen, and no way to really dodge it. If you ask them why, they'll say something like ""I'm rich I can afford this"". Then if you post about it on a forum or something, some poeple are going to say ""lol it's $500,000 it's not like they're going to frequently use it"" or ""stop making excuses why you're poor lol"". It's just not fun anymore.Getting into a solo lobby is the only way to have fun in GTAO, but more often than not kicks you out of online entirely, and you have to restart the game.The story is great, though. If really want to play it as opposed to watching videos on it, you should just wait for the sale. Mods are the only thing that can do that's still fun (after the story). The only time you should buy it is for mods or story. Just stick to watching videos for online."

126,588.4,Not Recommended," June 7, 2016",13,"As of June 7th 2016 the release date of the finance and felony update i can't recommend this game. It's having server issues and lots of bugs. Rockstar has a serious problem of not buying enough servers which causes the game to overload and not everyone can play at the same time. Typically this happens when it releases Xbox 360, Xbox One and on PC I can only speak for those systems because those are the only ones I played on. Rockstar will release a big update every once in a while and everyone gets excited and wants to play which also causes this overload on the servers. I'm sick of it, the top selling game of all time can afford some more server come on Rockstar get your♥♥♥♥♥♥together.I was trying out the new update in which you collect cargo and sell it so i was selling the cargo and I didn't get any money due to a Rockstar server error something about my transaction couldn't be processed. So i decided to help out my buddy and we tested a small delivery and it worked for him. We got the great idea to stockpile about $450,000 of cargo in his wearhouse which took many hours of tedious driving and all the while I was getting money for being his associate. He said lets just sell all this off and get it over with so we did and he got nothing I got only $10,000 for delivering it. So my buddy ended up getting the transaction error and got nothing and spent lots of money on these contracts, getting the cops to turn a blind eye and making us dissapear off the radar. He basically lost $550,000-$600,000. So this game as it is right now at this moment isn't even worth $10 let alone what they charge on steam. I will continue to play this game I have been playing it since it released on the xbox 360 and I love it but as it is right now don't bother buying it."

613,216.2,Recommended," July 31, 2016",67,"Had this since launch on PS3, have since owned it on PS4 and now PC. Only game I've ever owned on three platforms.Managed to transfer all my progress (houses, cash etc) from PS3 character. Game looks fantastic on PC, no wonder it took so long. This isn't your average PC port. Performance is generally around 60fps on high/ultra mix with a GTX980Ti and i7 config.To the game. Personally I'd say the campaign is worth the price alone. You control three characters, with varying degrees of likeability. Story is lengthy and fun. Lots of side missions. Great humour throughout. Solid script. Bank heists are great. Everything you expect from a classic GTA game.To the multiplayer, where a total gem can be found. A true open-world title. You can do as much or as little as you want in the multiplayer. Feel free to just explore, or undertake in the endless number of missions available. You can even play user created games, or create your own!Online heists were added, and although only 5 of them, they are a huge amount of fun playing. (Especially with friends) each heist requires several setup missions - all varied in nature. Heists are one of the best ways to build up currency for GTAOnline.Why would you need currency online? Because there is literally a mountain of things to buy. 100's of cars, planes, helicopters, yachts, weapons properties. You need a lot of cash if you want to live the Los Santos high-life. Participating in jobs online also pays (though not much) this could be races, team deathmatches, stunt rides or contact missions.PvP is also pretty well done, with mayhem potential considering some people have purchased tanks, jets and all sorts of advanced weaponry. Tip, if you're low ranked, think twice about starting trouble with any higher ranked players. If you're fed up of players C4'ing you new hypercar there is a passive mode, which means you can no longer be shot (or shoot)There doesn't appear to be any online level cap, so you can keep advancing. Though the final unlocks for weapons happen around 120 (minigun)My only two negatives would be -- Modders. Modding splits a community in two. Some people love it, some hate it. GTAOnline is ravaged by modders. My opinion is that modding is fine, if on the single player, or doing random jokey things online. It can lead to hilarious moments (shoutout to the guy who spawned a coffin around my waist and seagull on my head) but equally ruins the game. Here's why - some may have no intention of harming other players, and instead throw endless money on people (probably as two-fingered salute to R*'s extortionate cash-cards you can purchase with real £'s (£60 for $8m credits)) Great! You say. Not really. It's fine for those of you that just want to buy things with zero effort, but it leaves mission lobbies as ghost zones, noone does missions, because it's easier to beg a modder for cash. (You see this in EVERY lobby) Taking cash from modders can also get you banned from GTAOnline. So, even the good modding is bad online. Why grind a 30 minute mission for <$50k, when a modder drops $2m in 5 minutes... Sadly, this is now the mindset of most players.Now to the bad modders. Modders who use mods for PvP purposes. This could be all your usual expected PC game hacks. Aimbots, boosted health, invincibility, teleportation etc. But it can also be so much more. Modders can literally wipe every single player with a push of a button. They can set it so players spawn, and instantly explode - leaving it impossible to quit the server unless manually shut down GTA in task manager.They can change the rain to jumbo jets, crashing PC's as they cannot cope with the strain 100's of jumbos falling causes. Griefers can place giant blades outside apartments that destroy your vehicles the moment you leave your garage. They can drop UFO's on you when you're trying to fight, fire endless rockets out of their rocketproof cars. It's literally an endless headache playing vs modders who want to agitate the server - best option is to change servers, but most the same currently.- Second negative is just a general lack of cool details in Los Santos. In San Andreas, if you saw a pinball machine, or a pool table, chances are you could use it. In GTAV this isn't the case. Not a massive issue, just an observation.There is so much more I could say about the game. Overall the amount of free DLC added since launch, plus endless XP events and sales held weekly for in-game items, new game-modes. This is by far the best value for money game I've ever bought. £35 is almost incredible, given the trend of charging for DLC etc. Rockstar have given it all for free."

Constant patching to stop any sort of modding. Couldn't they just make a separate version of Single Player and Online, so the online version doesn't load anything? Nope.Then the constant issues and bad optimization. Crashes, can't load, stuck on loading screens, bad support, exceptionally constricting FOV (and attempts to make the mod invalid) that makes you puke, memory leaks, memory leaks, memory leaks, memory leaks, did I mention memory leaks? Well, memory leaks, lots of it!Since GTAIV, Rockstar has been a disaster on the PC scene, not releasing Red Dead Redemption, to shoddy ports like this. I would have assumed that they might have learned how bad GTAIV was when released due to performance issues, and being a crappy port. Nope, they didn't learn a thing! Delays after delays and they released another shoddy port.What sort imbecile creates an FOV with such restrictive options?! I loved the idea of the First Person perspective, but after throwing up TWICE, I gave up using it. The last time I had an issue with FOV was with Half-Life 2 when they changed FOV between FPS and vehicle use to simulate speed.I also assumed, due to the extreme time it took to get this out to PC that they would at least figure out that some peripherals, like a Rudder or a Joystick can't be used for typing. But if you do own any of them, especially a rudder pedal, when you type your login details in the horrid idea of a social club, it won't allow you to. It will pop-up a virtual keyboard, requiring you to use the rudder so it allows you to type on the keyboard.Not only that, some textures look washed out, or blurry. Where are the High Definition textures you get in games like Shadows of Mordor?For a classic to be sullied by bad policies like this, is truly saddening.

We've all been waiting for you.EDIT: After playing for a while I can attach a more informative review. Will update further when enough time is spent with the story and Online portion.Performance-wise, the game runs relatively well on my GTX 680. I have suffered from an apparent memory leak bug that forces me to shut down the game, but it can be fixed by adding more virtual memory page file size (look it up on the internet). Aside from that, the launch has been relatively smooth for me.The game world is full of detail. Put on sunglasses and you notice your vision is actually tinted. Park your bike in front of an entrance and a guy might shout you to move it. It's really the kind of benchmark-setting experience that makes other open world games look bland and lifeless.In my opinion, the story and mission pacing are far steadier and faster than in GTA IV.Driving is a little bit better, hard to pinpoint exactly what makes it so, but to me it feels more responsive. Shooting can feel clumsy, especially in first-person, and the guns don't feel all that special, but it's still fun.In addition to the updated graphics, the other PC-exclusive features include a custom radio station and the Rockstar Editor. Custom radio station is pretty simple. Add music files to a folder in the Documents, and you've got a Self Radio station in-game. It works, nothing more to add.As for the Rockstar Editor, it's really simple and fun to use. You mainly use markers to change cameras, apply effects, slow motion et cetera. I tested it for a bit and the end result is this:(I'm planning to make longer and better videos in the near future)The online feature can be a little bit confusing for new players to get into first, since it lacks direction, but you'll get it. Haven't played it too much to comment further, but it's fun to play jobs with friends, although the progression feels half-baked.Thanks for reading my review.

327,96.5,Not Recommended," July 10, 2016",10,"Note: my review applies exclusively to GTA Online. I have heard mostly positive things about the single player, but I bought it for online and have only played online.GTA Online is in many senses an enticing prospect. Drive around wreaking havoc and committing organized crimes with friends and randoms? Cool cars, cool clothes, cool weapons and a lot of cool explosions? Sounds great, right? Well, it would be, except for some pretty severe problems. The most extreme is the grindiness of it; between rank requirements (not too bad) and money requirements (horrible), you can get the shabby essentials in a reasonable amount of time, but a huge proportion of Online's content is so hideously expensive that only highly-skilled people grinding heists daily in pre-organized groups can really expect to get there without just paying Rockstar some real cash for online cash. And obviously, Rockstar likes it this way, since the more people get frustrated and just want that fancy apartment this month as opposed to two months from now, the more money they rake in. Additionally, one big pet peeve of mine is the game's tendency to throw you into sessions with strangers with no warning or ability to confirm/deny, including the I won't really comment on the fact that higher rank players have access to extremely powerful things and will repeatedly kill you with them, that's kind of obvious for a game of this nature and there are multiple ways to avoid it.On top of the grind, which is already pretty awful (more or less one of the worst of its kind in the entire Western market), the game is just not that smooth of an experience. Load times are long, GPU requirements are high, controls (except for shooting) are sluggish and unresponsive compared to other modern titles, menus are confusing to navigate with similar-seeming features scattered across entirely separate menus, and the netcode is just outright bad. Many times, while logging into online or switching between sessions, I've had it just fail out on me and dump me back to single player enduring the stupid loading screen already. While in sessions with people who are a bit farther away geographically, I've persistently had issues with the game bugging out while I'm in their vehicles - it acts as though they stopped driving, then seconds to minutes later corrects itself, and get this: if something like a helicopter crash happened as a result,That's right. This game isn't even really running on a server, it just passes people's actions around from client to client. Which, obviously, is a hacker's paradise, and to this day Rockstar hasn't really been able to stop people from using cheats online. Though they do a suspiciously persistent job of trying to get rid of the money-generating cheats specifically - the category that affects the quality of the online experience for other players the least, and Rockstar's cash flow the most.However, in spite of the many horrible flaws, there's still a glimmer of something bright, like a diamond flushed into the sewer. Driving around, committing crimes, and being stupid with friends and strangers actually be fun. The issue is, it's fun in of GTA Online and the way Rockstar bungled it. So unless you want to play single player, already have a group of people lined up to play with, or are simply a die-hard GTA enthusiast willing to overlook the many grating issues, I suggest giving this one a pass."

Oh that's a completely different story. I've played GTA:O for hundreds of hours on the PS4 before switching over to PC, so I know quite a bit. There are huge problems with GTA:O. First off, if you plan to play by yourself, don't. There is literally nothing fun to do if you play by yourself with no close friends. On PS4 I never played online unless it was with friends. It's so boring. Second, the PC version while better than console is absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on the online aspect. Modders and hackers in nearly every server. I don't get how Rockstar, a multibillion dollar company still hasn't fixed the modding and hacking issue. Third, the game is too much of a grind. Payouts for doing anything are super low with little to no value, and even if you did want to buy your way to the top shark cards are worthless. It would cost you $1000 real life dollars to get all content in the new ""Smuggler's Run"" update. Business are trash, and barely pay well. ""Oh but what about heists"". Heists in 2017 suck. The payouts are ok, but the main issue is trying to find 3 other people to do heist and heist setup missions with, and ones that don't suck on top of that. The PC version is also weird, as it has many inconsistencies. Phone services such as the mechanic (the guy you call to deliver a car to you) and MMI (the people that replace your car) are very inconsistent. On PS4, after two ringing noises they pick up, no matter what. On PC, it can vary from 2-4, and sometimes not at all. Other times they pick up but ""they're busy"". It can get very frustrating very fast. You also can't go ghosted to all players, meaning that you either have to put up with people's♥♥♥♥♥♥in freemode or go in passive mode, where you're extremely limited on what you can do. Rockstar has also drained innocent people's accounts because they suspected them of getting modded money. GTA:O is a♥♥♥♥♥♥show, and all we can do now is just hope that GTA VI Online isn't being run by the same greedy ♥♥♥♥s over at Rockstar.TL;DR: Don't get GTA V for the online experience unless you have friends to play it.

(Because of p2p servers.)-Sometimes mechanic doesn't seem to care about you, shatting on your head even if he had his payment.;singleplayer;-I feel like the graphics options on itself is useless, just like in Watch Dogs. I get the same FPS on 800x600 lowest settings, then on 1920x1080 everything high. How is that possible even?-The vehicles you buy, you have to take care of them. Otherwise, you just lose them. (AFAIK, there's no option like online to get it back... Sadly.)-Sometimes random events (one npc stole money from another, etc.) are just straight up not working. You return the stuff, the npc that got robbed just despawns. (Though, it's rare.)Cons that are common in both single, and online:You can't aim straight up. That is really dumb.The FPS mode because of the low FOV can easily cause motion sickness. (First game that caused me motion sickness in 10 years that I played..)On the other hand..pros:;online;-Fun online, if you're getting paired with a good host.-Different races (land, bike, sea, plane).-THEFT PROTECTION, AND INSURANCE. This is what the singplayer is missing. If your vehicle gets destroyed, you can just call MMI, and they'll provide you with the same car. (Usually other players blow up your car, in that case if it has both (protection and insurance) they'll pay some money (1% of the car's price?) and you can call MMI to get it back free.-Mechanic brings you a selected car from your garage if you give him a call (and decides to not be lazy.)-Pretty neat character creation. You can create unique characters with it.-Payout is quite good for the effort-reward system.-Heists are fun, with pretty good payout depending on difficulty. (And on host, how he sets the payout on the last ""day"" of the heist.)-In heists, it gives you the feel that everyone is equally needed (if you have no team lives left, and someone dies, the three can't clutch it, because the heist will fail.);single;-Loveable characters, hateable kids. (I'm looking at you, Jimmy.)-The story mode is pretty fun, it has it's own moments.-You can chose out of a three possible ending, two of them affects the endgame.-Assasination missions with Franklin let's you play stock market in your favour. (It is quite OP, actually. But hey, it's single so)-It could be either con, or pro, depending on which side of you are; The autosave function in missions are quite casual-friendly. (Usually if you do something in a mission, and you happen to die, or fail with the objective, you'll be booted back to that part, or a bit earlier.)-After you done the main story, there's still a lot stuff to do (if you haven't done it while playing the story already.) (And have chosen the third option as of the ending mission.)If I were to press myself, I could still write a lot to the pro, con side.I think they even themselves out, though the FOV and the cop system is a really big downer.Overall, I'd say I'm recommending the game, and at the same time, not.It's fun, but it has a dark side that can really screw you over if you'd just like to hop in, and play a few contact missions, or heists.For TL;DR people: Buy this game at your own risk, don't expect high quality online servers, it's fun if you get lucky with a host. Isn't worth 60 euros in my eyes, though. (As of being already an almost 2 years old game) and it's painfully obvious flaws.Cheers."

180,548.8,Not Recommended," December 6, 2015",60,"I waited a very long time to post this review and with over 350 hours played it's safe to say that I've done everything there is to do in the game. So with all that said, here we go.The singleplayer storyline is extremely fun and I had an absolute blast throwing endless hours into the game's singleplayer shenanigans. I think it was an amazing and refreshing change to have multiple main characters to switch between and instead of the one life you're exploring, you now have three. You've got Michael, the 'former' heister turned FBI informant who faked his death and is living in an upper-class mansion with a dysfunctional family, think Tony Soprano. There's Trevor, the redneck drug-peddling trailer-inhabiting junkie, oh and he's also a cannibal. Then you've got Franklin, the more level-headed ex-gang banger who serves as the younger one of the group. His only real goal is to get out of the hood and make it big.The game's story/missions and its overall gameplay is 10/10 for the genre with little room for improvement without changing everything we know GTA to be. That said, we'll move on to the dreaded topic of the game's multiplayer, which is the sole reason why I cannot recommend this game.Multiplayer is a complete and total joke and Rockstar has truly, TRULY dropped the ball on it. The online play was by far the biggest selling point of the game and it was one that they had advertised and 'focused' on extensively. The group heists are a lot of fun, as are the side missions and the ability to hang out and do whatever with your friends. My biggest complaint is the lack of meaningful content. They haven't added a single new heist since release, nor have they advertised or spoken about any future ones. They also still have yet to add the feature for players to make their own heists or game modes, which is the total key to making this game self-sufficient and community managed, if they were to do that then Rockstar could simply sit back and reap the rewards.The severe lack of content aside, anyone who has played this game has one single complaint in mind: HACKERS. EVERY single online lobby (with the exception of private made games) are absolutely filled to the brim with hackers and modders. While many are 'nice' their 'niceness' ruins online gameplay. Why do heists and missions when a modder can simply drop you millions of dollars? There's also the fact that not all of the modders you absolutely will find in online gameplay are 'nice'. Many will abuse their abiities such as godmode or the ability to blow up every player in the entire server at once - using your name. Rockstar hasn't done a SINGLE thing to rectify this situation and not only that, they haven't even so much as made a public statement about it or their plans.Instead of focusing on the very severe issues plaguing the game's online mode, Rockstar has chosen to release completely meaningless updates that contain nothing but a handful of new cars and horribly meshed/textured clothing items. Not to mention their absolutely god-awful customer support / community management & outreach. There are also a number of bugs that I myself have not run into, such as people being unable to connect to online or join lobbies.Don't even get me started on the apalling marketing practices shown by Rockstar during the 'sales'. I dare say that Rockstar has far surpassed EA in regards to greed and shady business practices.SIMPLY PUT - MY FINAL THOUGHTS:This game is a ♥♥♥♥ load of fun, the storyline and singleplayer gameplay is amazing. The online is the worst I've seen and Rockstar has shown incredible ability to completely ignore its playerbase and the problems plaguing it. This game is only good for private lobbies with friends and singleplayer playthroughs.I hope this review helped you!"

666,155.2,Not Recommended," January 1, 2016",124,"I waited a while to write this, mainly because I wanted to find quite a bit to write about. Nevertheless, after 100+ hours, I feel this game can be thoughtfully and precisely judged, more inportantly on all aspects of the game. I'll be dividing this review into two categories: Single Player and Multiplayer. Let's begin.Single Player:Single player starts off with the characters Michael and Trevor. Finishing a heist job from the North Yankton bank, they decide this is the last and final score. Yet, not all good things end well. They end up getting caught, and one of their crew members die. Trevor escapes, and that's where the story begins.Next and final playable character is introduced, named Franklin. Franklin is a petty thief, who is hired by Simeon (a local car dealsman) to reposess cars at the owners expense, although the reposession is not so to speak authorised. One day, Franklin gets the order to ""repo"" the car of a teenager, and upon arrival, Franklin is met with a seemingly rich family. After successfully lifting the car, Franklin drives away cheerfully, not knowing Michael is in the back seat. After pursuading Franklin to drive through Simeons shop, Michael makes a deal with him to make some ""real"" cash, thus involving Franklin in a series of robberies and other heists. Once word gets out Michael is ""back in the scene"", his old colleague Trevor finds out, who is furious because he thought Micheal died all those years back.That's pretty much the story. You rob a few banks, make some cash. The story is quite well and fun, I found no aspects to complain about, and even had hours of enjoyment playing through it. I actually wish it was longer, or a Single Player DLC was introduced which involved the main characters after the robberies. Even though side missions and such could count as this, I wanted more along the lines of the main story.All in all, the game is pretty much (in it's current state) only worth it for the story. The reason why is in Multiplayer.:Jesus Christ. Multiplayer is a ♥♥♥♥ing mess.Just to name a few problems:-Hackers. The ♥♥♥♥ers will infinitely shoot rockets at everyone until their dead, or at least until you want to turn on passive mode and ruin your experience.-""DLC"". With the addition of some well planned DLC, ""cash cards"" or microtransactions of in-game currency became available. The only reason I have a problem with this is that the ones that are worth anything at all (meaning the money from the card can't be made in 20 minutes time) are more than what the game is actually sold for. Yes, that's right. The developers are selling in-game money for $50 or even $100 real money. Not to mention this was the spawn of their genius Summer Sale idea to innitially discount the game 40%, only to remove the listing, add a Shark Card to it and stick it up as 40% off, but still cost the regular $60.♥♥♥♥♥♥move Rockstar.-Foreigners. I, myself, find me to be a very multicultured person. I don't mind at all anyone of a different nationality, only when it hinders my gameplay. Example: I'm still sort of new to the whole online mode of this game, so I often ask for hints during team modes such as heists. So, I was put into a lobby of non-english speakers for a heist, so I thought, okay, I can do this, I just have to fly a plane. I get the plane, go to the area, now I have to evade jets. No big deal. After flying around for 20 minutes with literally nothing happening, the team finally gets their♥♥♥♥♥♥together, and I can pick them up. I fly off, and we are supposed to lose the cops. My other pilot (who has the missles to shoot down the cops helicopters so we can get away faster) decides he's going to take a break, and lands at the beach. I fly around for maybe 20 more minutes, trying desperately to get these cops to go away, and even when there were none around for miles they somehow still found me. After I finally get them to go away, I now just have to drop them off. Somehow, my experienced skills did not tell me I have to stall my ♥♥♥♥ing plane in the sky about 200 meters up just do drop the ♥♥♥♥ers off, so I spent about another 10 minutes flying around screaming what the ♥♥♥♥ is going on??? Then, my genius teammates start screaming at me ""FLY TALL"". Any English speaker will not know what the ♥♥♥♥ that means, so when someone says fly tall, that literally sounds like nonsense. So, other helicopter guy decides his 15 minute break is up, starts flying upwards into the air, so I decided to follow. The game goes to the cutscene, and we all jump out. After 2 seconds, screen comes up the guy we broke out died. I left the game.Don't get me wrong, online can be some fun, and by that I mean if you have passive mode enabled or are in a solo session. Multiplayer is literally ♥♥♥♥ing cancer. Just avoid it at all costs."

Take-two has basically made any modification of the game impossible since they sent a cease and desist towards OpenIV, so gg no more mods. The shark cards and the updates do not help the game at all, and every update seems to be even more expensive than the last. Take-two and rockstar have made this game a total pay-to-win by this point. Only reason I have so many hours is because my friends and I used to play a ton until the updates started getting absolutely insanely pricey. Can't recommend this game to anyone, anymore.

Then take two ran along, pushed me off the fence,♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥on me, then proceeded run down the street singing ave maria. It was a move that made no sense to anyone but themselves and made themselves look ridiculous.The game itself is actually a bit meh. In some areas it's very strong, such as Rockstar's top tier writing and dialogue. In other areas, it's very bland, with the size of the world and number of activities making it seem unfocused at best. For example, the gun play itself feels very shallow, yet they put a good amount of effort into a bloody tennis simulator.If you like the sound of that and want a toybox as opposed to a game, more power to you, this should keep you occupied for a while. If you want a game that's critically good and will leave a lasting impact on you, look at other Rockstar titles such as the Max Payne series.Final nail in the coffin is GTA online.

""In a world where hackers rule the online gameplay, where the creators want you to spend 100% of the game's value in fake money, and profiles get banned when a hacker (unbenownst to you) ♥♥♥♥s with your account (or you mod the singleplayer); You have to ask yourself: What was Rockstar thinking!?""Well, if I had to guess, it's very similar to their ""Sale"" mentality, which is: CRAZY (Crazy bad, not crazy good, bt-dubs... or the actions of a money grubbing ♥♥♥♥♥). Have you ever heard of a sale on Steam where the game stays the same price, or goes up in price (OH, WAIT, forgot.. you do get a shark card! OH, WAIT, forgot... shark cards are useless to any actual gamer!). I have an idea, how about releasing the game for the actual 25% off, and letting those dumb enough to pay the extra 25% get the stupid shark card? Or, is that too much of a deal for Rockstar?: Of course it is...If I had to sum up this review I would say: Avoid GTA 5, right now. Not because the game as a whole sucks, but because Rockstar has some SERIOUS work cut out for them before the online play becomes anything but trolls and hackers. Although, if you're in it for the singleplayer, then you'll have a blast (that is, until you try to mod your game, then you could lose your copy). If your not much of a modder, then you'll be right at home, but do realize that the new EULA put out by Rockstar has pretty much forbidden any third-party modifications to the game, threatening temporary to permanent bans from online (Disappointing, when I think back on how much fun GTA IV mods were). But, if all of that doesn't bother you, if you still have a good amount of faith in Rockstar, I cannot deny that it's a game with great potential (that potential is just being directed towards shoddy business practices, atm)."

IT makes doing anything online impossible. I have tried 10 different sessions, about 3 hours of gameplay, and everytime I nearly complete a mission, someone teleports me and 1 shots me.Don't waste your time playing online if you are looking for a fun time.

People are cheating everywhere in multiplayer and to counter that, Rockstar just made the prices of every product highly expensive.The result is that only cheaters are able to pay for what they want, or rich people. Even grinding is not enough. (just check my playtime...)More and more products become more and more agressive and highly destructive. Multiplayer is a warzone, no more thug wars or bandits trying to struggle. Instead, we have generals fighting with tanks, Anti Aircraft missiles and so forth. You just can't play the game anymore.When it is possible to be connected, because there are a lot of connections problems. So even when you grind, you are disconnected and you cannot win the money you worked for.The only good point I still see in this game is that if you play only with friends (and if you manage to stay connected together...) or alone, you can just stay and stare at the perfect view, talking about stuf. But it is not worth the money you will put in it, and the infinite numbers of notifications reminding you that you have to grind or to pay to continue to play the game makes it impossible to chill out with friends too much. You always have a call from a fake guy, a sms or a mail, or even a ""help advice"" (sic) to polute your afternoon fun. And there is no way to remove them.At the end, I would say that this review could feel extreme or that I am biaised but I suggest you check on google for the flaws I showed.I played this game with 3 different computers, 2 different modems, I had my own team and everytime, and for everyone technical problem occures.Anyone saying otherwise is a fanboy.Rockstar has a lot of money with this game. It could be a good thing because it could mean better technical services and better servers, and better technology.I have nothing against videogame corporations making money. But this corporation is making money without never investing it in something that will make this game better.Only in more and more spectacular vehicules it becomes and more and more ridiculous.And when cheating becomes a problem, instead of working their *** to do something about that, they waveban people without filtering.Lazy job, lazy corpo, good devs but bad publishers.AVOID."

I've completed story mode about 11 times, I have about 6,000 hours online through my systems.Nothing really in my opinion needs to be drastically changed but it does seem like Rockstar are running out of ideas for online updates.Yes I do encounter the odd modder or two which does get annoying, but I just change sessions.I would rate this game a solid 7/10"

Only issue is that it's basically all people using trainers, who can't die, can teleport to you and kill you. They can also teleport you and blow you up whenever they like. IT makes doing anything online impossible. I have tried 10 different sessions, about 3 hours of gameplay, and everytime I nearly complete a mission, someone teleports me and 1 shots me.Don't waste your time playing online if you are looking for a fun time.

Sure the game has fancy graphics and a free open world for a player to choose to do as they want; but there is a very negative side of the game consisting of the terrible support from Rockstar and the way they run the game. I have had money stole from me both from Modders and Rockstar, ranging from a couple million to several millions. In addition, Shark Cards are advertised so much that players are nearly forced to buy them just to have money in GTA, although it is solely the players choice to purchase the overpriced cards, players are basically intruded into buying them through means of wiping players money balances back to zero every year so they have to buy shark cards.After hearing that countless number of innocent players have been banned just infuriates me -as i'm sure it infuriates others. I believe Rockstar only owes a big apology to their fan base and to the rest of the GTA community. I hope Rockstar will gain control over the modders and will finally crack down of the number of modders in the game, but I also hope they make it up for the ones that were innocently banned."

This and the biker business basically function like a mobile app telling you to buy some sort of premium currency or wait for hours.3. Gun running also added a muscle car mounted with a player controled dual minigun turret, missiles, and a mortar launcher. This car costs more than 2.5 million dollars flat out, and the weapon unlocks again require you to sift throug that awesome RNG unlock♥♥♥♥♥♥fest. The car is hilariously overpowered when driving around in a heavily populated public game, so if you are minding your own and see one within 2km driving remotely in your direction, you may as well just give it a hug and embrace death.4.

Hackers / scripters in nearly every public lobby you join. If there is a ban wave, expect to see them return in a few days.6. Upon the launch of gun running, R* decided to combat the rampant issue of people having money dropped on them by leveling out peoples bank acounts in comparison to their spending. This ended up with completely random results of some players having their entire banks with legit money reduced to nothing but thin air, players with hundreads of milions of dollars in cash having only about 5-10 mil taken away which hardly puts a dent in anything, and some people actually having their account leveled out.If you are one of the players who had their entire banks wiped out for no good reason, I am truly sorry.7.♥♥♥♥♥♥poor communication between the devs and the community to the point where it seems like the devs don't even care about players at all.8.

First person and third person views are both well done. Don't tell Rockstar this, but I would give my right nut and first-born son for some new vehicle DLC. Just wish I had friends so I didnt have to talk to myself so much while I play online.*EDIT* I am getting very frustrated and disheartened with this game. Online is driving me crazy and it feels like being addicted to nicotine. I know what i'm doing is bad, but I just can't stop doing it. I am sick of waiting up to 15 minutes to begin a heist only to get shot in the head and die instantly-yes im sure it's only because im a terrible player-thus failing the heist and putting me back at square one. And where are all the secret clubs online in the game? Why does it always feel so lonely online? I can't even get more than 2 other players to do a mission/job/whatever with me half the time. Perhaps most importantly; and in relation to my first grievance, why should I have to spend ~5 minutes setting up something like a race, and only get 1-3 minutes of enjoyment??? I don't feel I should have to spend 66% of my time in the game staring at loading screens that lead me to games with 1 or 2 other people who quit halfway through.**EDIT PT 2** My love for this game is only matched by my frustration. I am not considering anything from single player into my reviews since this games has already come out on multiple platforms and the only significant changes have happened online. So whit that in mind, I continue my whining about this game. When I am trying to play a race or a mission and i get a random invite from someone, why is it that 3 out of 4 times the player already started the mission by the time I can join thus instantly kicking me back out to freeroam? Can you imagine how frustrating it is spending 5 minutes on loading screens to do literally nothing? And when that doesnt happen, I'm being randomly kicked from the lobby either for no reason, or because the host didnt want me there, I guess. And another thing, hacking is only getting worse. multiple times per session, both during freeroam and activities/missions, there are hackers having a great time ruining everyone else's time. I might actually just stop playing this game. The ratio of fun to frustration is far too low for this to be worth it. I spend the majority of my time angry and annoyed than I do actually having fun.

163,200.7,Not Recommended," August 16, 2015",7,"**TL;DR? If you want GTA V for single player, 10/10 recommend. If you want to touch online, buy it on a console instead. Or don't buy it. Whatever**Let me start off by saying: I have been an avid GTA fan since playing my first and all consequent playthroughs of GTA III. They are amazing games, have always had stories that kept me wanting more and a great balance between good humour and serious game-play. GTA V is no exception to this, in fact, it hits a home run better than any subsequent game in the series.I originally bought GTA V on X-Box 360. I got the collectors edition, with the spiffy LS Cap and money bag. I took the week off work and I didn't leave the couch, except for bare essentials, for three days. I lived GTA V for those three days.Time came, the X-Box One was released, eventually R* released GTA V for that. So I bought it. The X-Box One wasn't what it should have been at release (another story for another time), so I ended up with a PS4 instead. I bought GTA V for that. Then, I decided to purchase another X-Box One. GTA V followed. Then a new graphics card, so I now have GTA V on PC. I love the game. It's a personal favourite.However, GTA Online is broken. It's that simple. Too many hackers dropping money, being invincible, blowing♥♥♥♥♥♥up. I had 5 million+ dropped on me, which for a day or two was absolutely awesome. Then it got boring. What's the point in doing missions/jobs/races when I have nothing to work for?The servers are rubbish, often having drop-out issues, 'kicking' everyone from my lobby (actually kicking me but being subtle about it). The DLC is fast becoming pointless. It's too expensive and not anything new. There have been no updates for the story, either.I've spent a lot of money on this game, on in-game cash too (queue desperate loser comments, blow me) for it to be this broken. Improve it. You're good at what you do, R*. If you're not going to give us Red Dead on PC, or LA Noire 2, at least fix this."
155,285.0,Not Recommended," June 22, 2017",7,"Don't get me wrong, the base game was good, despite zero replayability and a plot that doesn't even try to make sense.However, one cannot in good conscience support what happenned next:1. Plenty of free DLC content, with replayability, fun toys and a few nice quality of life improvements. Except all of it is multiplayer only.2. Players in multiplayer are actively incentivized to prevent other players from making money.3. There are tons of hackers in every other multiplayer lobby, often making it unplayable (and potentially exposing other players to the very strict ban policy).4. You know how FTP games are generally a lot more expensive than normal games? Yeah, prime example. The most recent upgrade, Gunrunning, would cost you around 400$ or 320 hours of making in-game money (or around 200 hours of pure no-fun farming). That's avoiding #2 and #3 above and assuming you ain't big on cosmetic upgrades. Oh, and if all you want is just one fancy toy from the update, you can't buy it on its own: its useless without a certain (costly) upgrade, which is unlocked through random (costly) research, and then you need a bunker (costly) to do research, and then you need a special new workshop (costly) to install the said upgrade, and then this workshop can only be deployed inside a new truck (costly)... You see where I'm going by now.5. How do the new updates to the game greet you? Right, with a black loading screen with a huge notice about what they'll do to you if you try to cheat. Yep, gaming mood going, going, gone...6. Take Two and Rockstar pretty much spit into the customers faces by issuing a cease and desist vs Open IV - modding tool that allowed the community to at least try to address #1 above; they essentially banned modding for single-player.All things considered, here's hoping to The Elder Scrolls: Vice City."

I mostly play it on console so I have a lot more hours then my record shows. I have been noticing a decline in how much fun this game is for a while. Every DLC has made the game a bit more annoying for the average player. The problem is someone buys all the new op stuff with a shark card and then runs around and trolls everyone. This wasn't a big deal in the early game because all players had basically equal footing. But now let's say a new player joins; how are they going to defeat an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in an apc driving in circles around them and blowing them up every time they respawn?All I do in this game these days is just fly around in planes. I don't even do missions anymore or races because people don't want to anymore. It's just buy money through microtransactions. Because it's much simpler.The game also admittedly has a huge problem with online hackers. But instead of doing anything real about it the publisher used this as a chance to try and make more money. The essentially blanket banned mods on pc largely hitting the single player base. They made this action trying to say it had to do with getting rid of hackers. However the real reason they did this was to effect their bottom line. Force people not to use their single player mods so the only way they can get new stuff is through online dlc.Unfortunately recent events have been the straw that broke the camels back for me.... That is if this was straw. It's more like a 50 pound weight dropped from a couple feet above a dehydrated, slowly dying camel."

Countless customers, myself included, have gotten their accounts banned from online play for no reason, and Rockstar doesn't even have the f*cking courtesy to tell you what you did to get banned (let alone actually unban you). I've called Rockstar support and have been hung up on for even having the audacity to ask what I did to get banned. They straight up tell you ""we can't tell you what you did to get banned"", then passionately assert that all bans are final and are not repealable, even though the evidence that this is happening to many, many of their customers is readily available to them. At the current time, I have no reason to believe they could possibly not know about this problem, so there is no excuse. I have never in my life seen a more arrogant, neglectful company, and time is drawing close to when a formal case will be made against them. They're offering a product, happily taking people's money, then taking the product away, and not even allowing the customer to know what they did, or talk to someone who can address the problem. That is a scam. It is my hope that Rockstar soon finds themselves in court and their sh*t company is shut down for good.

The story in GTA V is really good, most my hours are from the singleplayer. The characters feel like REAL people and develop as people the more you engage into the plot.

Not much else I have to say besides it's something to experience.

Hackers have free reign to basically do anything they want (rain money on people, spawn any kind of object from guns to DLC cars to people and so on) as well as the option to completely invalidate the only thing keeping the hackers and cheaters away by removing the reports and redflags on their accounts thanks to these cheat menus.the game is a lost cause, but at least Rockstar is actively trying to fix it, but to fix MP would require the rebuilding of both games, and i doubt they want to spend that time and money doing that.if you MUST ABSOLUTELY buy GTA5 DONT buy it with a shark card! buy the game alone at a discount and play both components for less then an hour each and decide if its worth keeping, dont be afraid to use the refund option."

Now we got it and it's BS, of course you can't start the Heist like you'd actually do, you have to buy another building, I guess you won't earn anything above 1.5 Million if that isn't already too much and the best thing is, you have to do almost everything in an open lobby.

My review will stay negative irreversably.My full comment on this in German to be found here: http://steamcommunity.com/id/syping/recommended/271590/Secondly, the game is NOT worth the full price. Beginning with the ""optional"" money cards that must be purchased for real money, because in-game stuff is EXPENSIVE and would take months of grinding (unless you're lucky to meet a kind cheater which there's plenty of, yet not all are kind at all)Thirdly, the PC ""port"" is TRASH. I sincerely, honestly, from my heart am saying this. The least annoying part are the tiny menus that you must scroll through with arrow keys (because mouse controls in menus are so bad that I'd classify them as ""not working""). They are irritating and usually I can barely find what I need.A little more annoying is the tiny-tiny minimap that you cannot enlarge permanently (despite having so much space on the display).More annoying is the aim system. Basically, the ""controller folks"" have a helping auto-aim. They can shoot you in the head from over 250m consistently and you can't! (Yes, I may be bad in GTA5 but hell, not that bad considering over 3k hours in CS in total)The most annoying: HELICOPTERS ARE UNCONTROLLABLE. Quite literally. Even after my aircraft control overhaul. You are and will be inferior to those who have bought a controller (that's yet another peripheral device to pay for; keep in mind the game price)Here are facts from the multiplayer:*It's a spread issue, that player who had bought in-game money (""shark cards"") haven't received them. Search for: ""didn't receive shark card money gta5"" - support either doesn't care or simply doesn't help.*Much Cheaters. Many false-positives. Such ""anti-cheat"" system that asks people to manually report cheaters. Wow.*Chat history is only 4 messages long - meeting sane strangers is nearly impossible*Multiplayer, jobs, lobbies take at least 1-2 minutes to load. Google suggests ""gta v"" for the term ""loading screen simulator""*Online lobbies tend to get emptier over the course of 15-30 minutes. Or you get a timeout before that happens. You are forced to join another lobby and endure loading times*The game has become so grindy, that players are mostly friendly to those who make money instead of battling with them. Or you simply join a friendly crew lobby and keep doing missions to grind money for the next buy.The game looks beautiful and has plenty of potential.

This meant that people who wanted to buy GTA V on sale didn’t actually get a discount, since the game was much more expensive than normal with the useless credit card. People who don’t want to waste money on GTA Online had to buy the bundle anyway. That was truly a d*ck move by Rockstar.GTA V is a good game (aside from GTA Online, which is a terrible cash grab), but Rockstar is a terrible company."

1,257.3,Recommended," March 30, 2017",127,"This review is about singleplay only. I'm not a multiplayer guy, and were it up to me, I'd separated GTA V solo and GTA Online completely. But anyway, that's not an issue, and I'm just talking of the single-player game Rockstar finally released on the PC, despite their ugly ""maximize profits"" policy. And I really think that GTA V is hugely overrated.A little spoiler up ahead (it's not even a spoiler, technically): In the end of the game, Michael says ""I'm too old for this"", and that's, I think, the words of Sam Hauser.You see, technically GTA V kicks asses, alright, it is still the best GTA-like game on the market. You have cars, bikes, boats, jets, helluva lot of activities and stuff to make your play a unique one, an unforgettable experience... But it fails in the most major aspect, for what so many people loved Vice City and San Andreas titles: the attractiveness of the story. The compassion thing. I've blamed the GTA IV for it, and it's the same, and somehow even worse with the GTA V! Just like the Mafia 2 & 3, where the main characters are so boring and unpleasant people I'd kill them myself, were it an option.The case of GTA V is worse than GTA IV and alot worse than San Andreas by the originality option as well. Let's take Trevor, for instance - for he's obviously the most noticable guy of whole trio. He's all kinds of a bad dude, sure, but I've played the game with just the same character a decade ago! It was the Scarface, and even the ""special"", the rage mode, was the same for Tony Montana, as it is for Trevor. Scarface game was quite a mediocre one, somewhere on the level of True Crime maybe, and by the time of San Andreas, it would be a joke to copy something into Rockstar game what was done in some wannabe competitors title. Today it's a major issue. Now, GTA V is still a quite good GTA-like game, it's still making shots and all, but it's just one in a row. It's not an overmighty king it was once.Oh, I'm sure that 10-years old who now plays and streams GTA Online like mad, are not gonna agree with me. And some middle-to-old aged creeps like Sam Hauser itself, would point me at the more realistic world around, that was made in GTA IV and V. I know, I know, I'm myself a middle-aged creep who likes realistic stuff much more than some phantasy elves and ponies. But, there is still a compassion thing. A mood after playing San Andreas or Saints Row 2 is better in my case than the mood from GTA 4, 5, or Saints Row 3, 4... Those late games provide less than pretends, and sometimes even hollowing your emotions rather than provide you with some new and strong ones.So, let's come to the mark thing. I'll give GTA V a 7.5/10, for the amount of work they made. Minus point is for hollowing unlikely characters, minus point for an overall creepy atmosphere GTA V providing. Even the radio was worse than usual, oh, mate, that's a disaster!"

38,"1,566.7",Not Recommended," April 25, 2016",108,"This game is half bad, half good, yeah in that order because bad is the first thing coming to my mind. Why?1- because once you finish the story mode you have nothing left to do if you're not interested in online mode. Seriously, it's so boring to wait for contacts to call you for help. Playing golf, tennis, etc is nice ....... 3 times then it's just boring.2- because online is infested by whining kids and uneducated brats. And no, going in private session is not a solution if you're interested in joining activities as you won't get any notification of any activity. Boring.3- online servers are the most shity things ever! You spend 50% of your time on loading screens. For example, me. I played almost 800H (I'll come back to why later) but in fact, on these 800H I spent about 400H waiting while watching a fuc*ing laoding screen. By the way, you're lucky if you don't regularly see the message ""Loading time too long, back to GTA, try again later to join GTA Online."" or if you're not simply ejected from activities or lobbies because Rockstar servers had a stuttering problem. And no it has nothing to do with my connection as I play on other online games and never had any problem, only with GTA.4- online is boring as hell if you are not interested in doing the same activities again and again and again and don't have a crew to have fun with. Back to my almost 800H of game: Yeah, it's a lot, but it's only because around 300H, when I was ready to give up on the game out of boredom I MET PEOPLE FROM A CREW WITH WHOM I NOW HAVE A LOT OF FUN.5- cheaters everywhere! And a lot a script kiddies who think they are hte best hackers in the world (even if they don't even know how to spell hacker, and even less how to hack) and who spend their time ruining the game for everyone because Rock* don't give a sh*t about them and is only interested in people spawning money bags because they think it influences the sell of their shark cards (as if anyone with two braincells would buy a shark card... oh wait, there are in fact people buying them, go figure...)So now, let's go to the positive points of the game...... Wait, I search some...... I know there are some great things in this game..... Be patient, I'll find one or two...... Hum, oh, maybe that:1- it's GTA! Yeah, GTA games are always good, come on, you know, you love it. Great maps, huge open world, strange humour always funny, nice radio stations and possibility to make your own, nice cars, nice guns, nice races, nice missions, ...2- if you find a crew, and by that I mean a real crew with people you can interact with, not the IGN crew where they are hundreds and nobody talks to anybody, they don't even play together, it's just to be in the IGN crew, well, as I said, if you find a real crew, then GTA can be the most entertaining game of the moment.3- hum, sorry, I can't think of anything else good in that game.So, is that game good? Yes because it's GTA and no because it's way too ♥♥♥♥ed up. Would I recommend it? Yes if you have friends playing it or find yourself a nice crew.

Modding was a huge part of enjoyment regarding the Grand Theft Auto series. Me personally, I cannot believe it turned this way.I don't know if this is true, but shutting down OpenIV to avoid 'cheating' in GTA:Online?It makes no sense in my eyes and in my mind at all. Altering files with OpenIV for the multiplayer?You'd get banned straight away, not necessarily instantly, but really close in the nearest future.Though everyone I know is using it only for purposes like, being creative, designing (gameplay-wise, graphic enhancements et cetera), learning skills (like 3D creations, vehicles, characters / peds / models, even programming like scripts, an example would be, instead of just gunning around, people go ahead and play the actual side of peacemaker, a cop, so there are mods to play either as firefighter, paramedic and police officer, even since GTA:IV and GTA: San Andreas). If TakeTwo has any reasons for OpenIV to be shut down, for reasons like GTA:Online, this is not reasonable, rather questionable. It could only be to gain profit. Buy SharkCards, play GTA:Online. This and that.But if we're going to be honest, if people would alter the game with OpenIV to cheat in GTA:Online, they would be banned pretty soon. But then, creating a new account would mean, buying a whole new copy of the game. You must be pretty dedicated and messed up to actually waste money for cheating like this, it would rather be an addition that needs medical attention and beyond.I don't know ANYONE who would use OpenIV to disturb the online experience. It is meant for singleplayer, and I don't know how this is and could affect the online world and others' experience.As of now, I won't pre-order any Rockstar Games and TakeTwo Interactive games, perhaps not buy them at all in the future. Modding was a good impact on the game, even with the dozens of restrictions Rockstar threw at us, it has only been made worse. Can't tell if they are taking the consumer's opinion and them in general serious anymore or just as a profit for themselves. What are you creating this game for? For the players, or for your own profit? Well, you can't make any profit without the huge amount of players who used to support this series.88% of the recent reviews, overwhelmingly negative. If that's not a sign already, then I don't know.It's awful to see the people who spend their time on, amazing content creators (without charge of money), users, roleplayers and more, dedicating themselves with passion and interest, being ignored by the industry like Rockstar Games and TakeTwo. It rather seems that they don't care at all about their players no more. With that said, there's a lack of chance, that they might reconsider their 'strategy' on marketing, online (cheating) policy and their plans all together."

138,49.1,Not Recommended, February 9,9,"Jesus I've never been so torn when writing a steam review for a game, I really wish there was an option for a neutral review.The single player campaign is great, one of the best I've played in a long time.Compelling characters, interesting side missions, an open world that feels incredably real & 'lived in', and a truly engaging main story.GTA Online, however, is total garbage.A frustrating and temperamental peer-to-peer system that leads to ridiculously long loading screens that frequently turn into infinite ones, as well as having no language/reigional settings as you would with a server based game, meaning you'll spend most of your time in a game with people who don't even speak your language (Which is really quite pathetic considering the focus on team-work in a lot of the online missions)Overpriced vehicles, properties etc presumably to try and encourage you to buy the microtransactions.And perhaps worst of all, an anti-cheat system that'll flag you for playing with texture mods, but somehow fail totally at blocking the type of modding/cheating/'hacking' that actually matters. It's literally been less than 24 hours since I started playing the Online mode and have already had three sessions ruined by cheaters, first with someone repeatedly teleporting everybody on the map to a location where he'd rigged bombs so he could loot the cash we drop, then by an unkillable 'god mode' character just simply killing everything in sight for the fun of it, then with a guy running around somehow spawning campfires in people which will kill you repeatedly until you close the game.I think I'm going to have to make this review a negative because Rockstar have made a lot of money from their online mode and despite this, nearly 3 years on, they've yet to fix the vast majority of it's issues.However I'm mostly doing so in the (likely vain) hopes they'll realize how badly the flaws in online mode has affected the reviews here and make improvements if they ever make a GTA VI.So if you have no interest in GTA Online and only intend to play the single player campaign, then that is something I can whole heartedly recommend."

145,332.4,Not Recommended," June 20, 2017",9,"It had been all nice and great, but now TakeTwo decided to pull the strings and ruin the entire community. Modding was a huge part of enjoyment regarding the Grand Theft Auto series. Me personally, I cannot believe it turned this way.I don't know if this is true, but shutting down OpenIV to avoid 'cheating' in GTA:Online?It makes no sense in my eyes and in my mind at all. Altering files with OpenIV for the multiplayer?You'd get banned straight away, not necessarily instantly, but really close in the nearest future.Though everyone I know is using it only for purposes like, being creative, designing (gameplay-wise, graphic enhancements et cetera), learning skills (like 3D creations, vehicles, characters / peds / models, even programming like scripts, an example would be, instead of just gunning around, people go ahead and play the actual side of peacemaker, a cop, so there are mods to play either as firefighter, paramedic and police officer, even since GTA:IV and GTA: San Andreas). If TakeTwo has any reasons for OpenIV to be shut down, for reasons like GTA:Online, this is not reasonable, rather questionable. It could only be to gain profit. Buy SharkCards, play GTA:Online. This and that.But if we're going to be honest, if people would alter the game with OpenIV to cheat in GTA:Online, they would be banned pretty soon. But then, creating a new account would mean, buying a whole new copy of the game. You must be pretty dedicated and messed up to actually waste money for cheating like this, it would rather be an addition that needs medical attention and beyond.I don't know ANYONE who would use OpenIV to disturb the online experience. It is meant for singleplayer, and I don't know how this is and could affect the online world and others' experience.As of now, I won't pre-order any Rockstar Games and TakeTwo Interactive games, perhaps not buy them at all in the future. Modding was a good impact on the game, even with the dozens of restrictions Rockstar threw at us, it has only been made worse. Can't tell if they are taking the consumer's opinion and them in general serious anymore or just as a profit for themselves. What are you creating this game for? For the players, or for your own profit? Well, you can't make any profit without the huge amount of players who used to support this series.88% of the recent reviews, overwhelmingly negative. If that's not a sign already, then I don't know.It's awful to see the people who spend their time on, amazing content creators (without charge of money), users, roleplayers and more, dedicating themselves with passion and interest, being ignored by the industry like Rockstar Games and TakeTwo. It rather seems that they don't care at all about their players no more. With that said, there's a lack of chance, that they might reconsider their 'strategy' on marketing, online (cheating) policy and their plans all together."
674,9.6,Recommended," January 26, 2016",9,"Just to get this out of the way, I don't play multiplayer and have no desire to play multiplayer, so this review is for the single player experience only. I'm loving this game so far. The voice acting and story are both top notch. Assuming that you have played Grand Theft Auto games before this, you will feel right at home with the open world nature. I'm not too far into it yet, but there is already a ton to do and places to go within the game. In the past, you couldn't really interact with much outside of the cars, ammunation, and a few other places. Now, there is a ton of stuff to do. You can play tennis, and the tennis is actually better than most tennis games available on Steam. You can play golf and the golf is as good as any golf game available on Steam. I haven't gotten around to anything else yet but I know there's more. There are a ton of vehicles to use including bikes, dune buggies, ATVs, Wave Runners, boats, planes, tons of cars, trucks, motorcycles, etc. The game is optimized incredibly well. I have experienced no bugs so far.Again, I'm not even very far into the game yet and I'm having a blast. I can see myself goofing around with this game for a long time to come. If you're a fan of the series or open world games in general, you should check it out."

138,49.1,Not Recommended, February 9,9,"Jesus I've never been so torn when writing a steam review for a game, I really wish there was an option for a neutral review.The single player campaign is great, one of the best I've played in a long time.Compelling characters, interesting side missions, an open world that feels incredably real & 'lived in', and a truly engaging main story.GTA Online, however, is total garbage.A frustrating and temperamental peer-to-peer system that leads to ridiculously long loading screens that frequently turn into infinite ones, as well as having no language/reigional settings as you would with a server based game, meaning you'll spend most of your time in a game with people who don't even speak your language (Which is really quite pathetic considering the focus on team-work in a lot of the online missions)Overpriced vehicles, properties etc presumably to try and encourage you to buy the microtransactions.And perhaps worst of all, an anti-cheat system that'll flag you for playing with texture mods, but somehow fail totally at blocking the type of modding/cheating/'hacking' that actually matters. It's literally been less than 24 hours since I started playing the Online mode and have already had three sessions ruined by cheaters, first with someone repeatedly teleporting everybody on the map to a location where he'd rigged bombs so he could loot the cash we drop, then by an unkillable 'god mode' character just simply killing everything in sight for the fun of it, then with a guy running around somehow spawning campfires in people which will kill you repeatedly until you close the game.I think I'm going to have to make this review a negative because Rockstar have made a lot of money from their online mode and despite this, nearly 3 years on, they've yet to fix the vast majority of it's issues.However I'm mostly doing so in the (likely vain) hopes they'll realize how badly the flaws in online mode has affected the reviews here and make improvements if they ever make a GTA VI.So if you have no interest in GTA Online and only intend to play the single player campaign, then that is something I can whole heartedly recommend."

203,358.7,Not Recommended," May 31, 2015",194,"Single player is fantastic, so why the thumbs down?GTA Online: It turns the game into a way over-regulated sandbox. I'm going to start with modding because it's the sole reason that a large number of fans prefer to play GTA on PC as opposed to console. Private modders motivated solely by wanting to do crazy things in this big open sandbox would do just that -- create tools, sometimes even scripting languages, and such to expand previous installments to way beyond what they were. As of late May, the relationship between Rockstar and modders is tumultuous at best. Rockstar realizes that the modding community is a huge aspect of the success of PC releases, but they didn't really prepare for the modding community and it has ended up clashing with their regulated sandbox and business model, which is a hodgepodge of things that companies have been doing in the last 5 years that have worked.So what is this regulated sandbox that I keep going on about, and why is it so flawed? Lets start with the reputation(experience) point and currency systems. Ironic coming from someone who used to be a rabid RPG fan, but experience points in an online game are a bald-faced ""Skinner Box"" system that gives a game artificial longevity and is essentially a mechanism for compulsion. It takes somewhere between 150 and 250 hours to hit level 120, which is where you've maxed out everything except the maximum number of armor you can carry. To get there you can go through hastily assembled missions that don't even have voice acting, heists which get old after awhile, various deathmatches, parachuting, races, and a bunch of activities that most people don't enjoy doing like tennis and golf. There are daily objectives that help speed up this leveling process, but it's just another compulsion/loyalty element as it must be performed every day.The problem with this system, and much of it stems from the fact it takes so long to max out everything, is how imbalanced it makes the game. If you're a level 8 in a deathmatch against a level 110, you're probably going to be annihilated because the level 110 has twice as much health as you and more armor capacity, not to mention faster reload speed and less recoil. If the deathmatch is allowing inventory weapons, the imbalance gets much worse, with weapons like RPG and Heavy Sniper to contend with. Races are no better -- you cannot win a bicycle race if you lack max stamina, which allows you to pedal furiously forever. (versus about 15-20 seconds with sub-max) Handling and other aspects are affected by driving skill, and of course unlocked weapons affect the outcome of a GTA race. Custom vehicles also imbalance races. So basically, Rockstar made all this regulated PvP and yet it's completely imbalanced, and thus can't be taken seriously. It's no wonder that so many deathmatches are made simply for farming RP and cash.I go back to my artificial longevity point to mention that most people are going to pick a few things that they like -- however, no one wants to repeat the same mission over and over. Nor will most people want to get trounced in PvP by people who have no life. (irony intended) What is especially hard to stomach about all of this is that the game itself openly mocks the majority of what they're doing with their Call of Duty parody named ""Righteous Slaughter 7"". XP, persistent upgrades, and pay-to-win are among the things they mock...all sins that GTA Online commit.Even though this compulsion system is highly flawed, Rockstar is hard at work protecting it against the evil modders. How dare people not ""earn"" level 120 by shaving weeks off their lives. How dare people get money from some other source than Rockstar, to purchase roughly $30 million worth of goods that are exclusive to the online stores. There was a mass banning in early May 2015 over this. Reason? Rockstar wants you to buy their imaginary money with micropayments...much like Zynga. In fact, with price points almost lifted directly from Zynga's catalog. The highest price point is even, you guessed it, $99.99 for the whales. And let me put this into perspective...Rockstar has made roughly $3 billion from game sales alone. It's the most profitable single game ever made, and they're alienating an important part of the fan base for what surely amounts to less than 1/100th of that.Now it's worth noting that Rockstar is trying to figure out how to handle the modder issue but it's a bit too late -- the port needed to be made modder friendly from the ground up. They could have released server software and automatically have stat changes on private servers not be reflected on Rockstar servers. However, because they didn't, it's going to be some time -- probably not until GTA VI, that these issues are resolved.So what about their own creation tools? I'll start with the video editor -- it's less flawed than the Creator, but it's only good for artsy videos. If you need to make any kind of tutorial style video, don't even bother. The caption length is too short, the caption placement handling is awkward, and the text editor for captions lacks basic features like clicking between letters and having the cursor go there. The Creator is very flawed. In overhead mode, it can be very difficult to place checkpoints on hills. If you want to place any objects in midair, you need to spend many hours manipulating the very fine time/space windows allowed for this kind of placement. Even though some of the most popular community maps use this, Rockstar hasn't embraced it and has kept it limited. There's also a profanity filter that's so poorly written that words like ""Sniper"" and ""Skyscraper"" get filtered out of descriptions. It's virtually impossible to promote your maps and there's a glut of maps due to there being mini-achievements for publishing a map and having it played. It's possible for maps to be viewed as ""corrupted"" and need to be made from scratch -- it's happened to two of my crew. Finally, once you publish a map, any time you go to update it, you can't save a local copy without making a brand new duplicate -- it won't update for anyone who has bookmarked the old version. (and the editor will crash, a lot, even on low settings)This aspect didn't fit in anywhere else, but the online loading times are terrible -- it can take over a minute to load into a Freemode game.With all the complaining in this review, which might be viewed as unfair, I need to contrast this game with TF2. Valve has embraced the modding community with all its Source games, including TF2 -- Rockstar is struggling with it in GTA V. In TF2, players pay real world money for cosmetics that don't affect gameplay, while in GTA V, real world money is used for an in-game advantage. TF2 -does- charge for weapons, but these weapons are easily acquired via trading or random drops, far easier than in GTA V. (but it's only fair to point out TF2's one sin) TF2's hammer tool is frankly superior to Rockstar's Creator, though I can only fairly compare the interface, speed, and how much potential time is lost due to errors with the software. AlliedModders, a fan-made company, handles all the other aspects of TF2 modding -- and they do it well, because they care. TF2 lets fans run servers and Valve only very lightly interferes with the management of these servers. (entirely related to paid cosmetics, which is fair) GTA V isn't there yet, and may never be there. TF2 has balanced PvP, GTA V does not. GTA V has artificial longevity through Skinner Box methods, while TF2's longevity is a product of a solid base, along with the company working along side its community. It should be no wonder that GTA's been slowly losing players and will soon be overtaken by the aging TF2.I write this scathing review not to bash GTA V, but in the hopes that it will be read, and will influence the development of GTA VI. GTA's overall fan base is enormous -- hopefully Rockstar will get it right in the next installment."

While it adds a lot of cool content, it is primarily designed to pump players for cash through the Shark Cards, unless you want to grind.

I can basically get some coffee while I'm joining a session (or loading story mode, for that matter). It's not my connection and definitely not my computer. My friends have the same issues.2nd: The netcode.Whatever they did there, they failed horribly. It's incredible how this game just sucks your internet connection dry. I can play it. But everyone who does not have a 16Mbit/s connection or a slower computer has serious lags that make the game nearly unplayable.3rd: The stability.When the game came out, you were not able to switch back to fullscreen mode. The screen remained black and the game needed to be shut down. They fixed that one at least. I also don't get any crashes personally. BUT: I know at least three people who get them regularily, one of them is in my heist team, so we need to restart heists from time to time which sucks badly.4th: The Social Club.Why the HELL does that garbage even exist anymore? Basically everything the Social Club does can also be done through Steam. When I want to open a party in Team Fortress 2 or Dota 2, I just invite people through Steam. So when you implement a DRM like Social Club in your game, why not just STEAM? The social features of Steam have NEVER failed me. Social Club does on a regular basis. Not only do invites not reach me often, even if they do, they are heavily delayed.But the worst part about Social Club by FAR is the security. I have no idea if it is still the case, but in the first few weeks, THOUSANDS of accounts were stolen. Hell, a friend needed nearly two weeks to get his account back (at least he did eventually), and it was not because he had a weak password, but because even HE was able to get into other people's accounts after he researched a bit on the topic!5th: The most dickish move a publisher could actually make.We write the 11th of June. People are eagerly awaiting the Steam sale to buy a game which has been out on consoles for YEARS now. They don't want to pay 60€ for it. Might be because they don't want to BECAUSE it is such an old game, or because they simply don't want or can spend that much money on a single game. Whatever is true, does not matter at all. They just awaited at least a -15 or -20% deal on the game as we always get during such sales.But what happens? With the start of the Steam sale, Rockstar releases ""DLCs"" that just give you in-game money you can also get through normally doing heists. They bundle the game with one of those DLCs so the price increases to 75€. But HEY, people still want their sale, right? So we do a -15€ discount so the game basically matches the usual 60€ price tag! People will love that, right? RIGHT?NO, they freakin' don't! And while I DID pay the full 60€ when the game came out, I regretted it so much since then. And I was one of the people who defended Rockstar so much in the beginning. ""Yeees, the game is years old, BUT that does not make the gameplay worse. It also has much better graphics than PS4 and XBone. It is even a good port this time!""So while the story is pretty enjoyable, everything else about this game is not. It has pretty much destroyed it for me. I'm not sure if I will even finish the goddamn story."

315,380.8,Not Recommended," October 25, 2015",573,"UPDATE: Wow. Rockstar and Take Two Interactive have now officially established themselves as fundamental anti-consumerists. Burn in Hell.https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2017/06/15/grand-theft-auto-iv-mod-tool-openiv-shut-down/--------------GTA V is one of the most profound and mind-numbing examples on how you can take 'the' most recognized video game franchise on earth and turn it into a cancerous clusterfùck of hideously moronic design decisions that have no equal in terms of the sheer stupidity and broken functionality that currently plagues this depressingly messed-up title.As the faults with this game are numerous and require their own individual attention, I am simply going to list them, one by one while providing proof of their existence.------------------------------------------------------------------1. Online functionality.Putting aside the current average load times of getting into the online game being 1.6-3 minutes for people with top-tier gaming PC's that have SSD's, the state of the GTA servers as of right now are a horrendous mess, as anyone that played the game on console (or even watched videos of others doing so) for more than 3 hours can attest to. The problems from there has not been dealt with for the PC version.Disconnect after network failure after server outage after connection issues after time-outs after server overloads, Rockstar continues their behavior of not knowing how to host proper servers. Even after delaying the PC release a multiple times for several months and perhaps more importantly, giving out fat bonuses to people who pre-order weeks before release to massively help them gain a better idea of the incoming traffic, they still fail horrendously to offer any kind of steady service when the online aspect of the game is concerned. It is however, made much worse by how the multiplayer is constructed around clumsy lobby systems with ZERO flexibility. Go through the effort of creating a heist and wait for players to fill the lobby, play 95% of the mission and have someone disconnect? MISSION CANCELLED, LOBBY CLOSED DOWN, CREATE A NEW GAME MANUALLY AND WAIT FOR PLAYERS TO RE-JOIN TO START AT SQUARE 1 AGAIN. Let someone join mid-game to replace him? Pause the heist itself and give the disconnected player time to rejoin? Create an AI partner to take his place? Nope, back to the 2 minute loading screens with you. Over. And Over. And Over Again.------------------------------------------------------------------2. System functionality.Memory leaks, physics glitches that causes crashes, black screens, FPS spikes, blue-screens, graphic-driver crashes and cases of just plain bad optimization where laptops would have the game run off their integrated GPU's first before checking for any 'external' ones. GTA V has them all and It is a very depressing fact to face after all those months upon months of waiting for the game to be, and I quote: ""As polished as possible""-----------------------------------------------------------------3. Cheaters.On both offline AND online, the number of cheaters have been routinely going up in terms of being spotted by the community and they show little to no signs of slowing down:Due to the manner that Rockstar handles hackers (by slowly detecting them and putting them in queue to only be in games with other cheaters), they can cause MASSIVE amounts of havoc, most of which end up being beyond repair and going outside the control of Rockstar themselves due to the dynamic nature of the game. The most acute symptom of this very serious issue is the server stability for where these hackers roam. As seen in the video, the hacker spammed UFO's and caused insane amounts of lag to happen due to flooding the host with collission data, vehicle spawns and teleports while also flooding other players with money drops. The much more chronic results are perhaps more damaging as money can trade hands in so many ways. Be it, being dropped on the street, have someone get mugged, spend it on cars & other items and re-sell/give them away.. The list goes on and most of these things, Rockstar can't reliably keep record of and this isn't even where the issues stop either.There are also other more logistical things to keep track of. For example: They have to dedicate a number of their servers to actually put hackers on, meaning they are redirecting company resources to let hackers roam around instead of focusing these efforts on contributing to a more positive experience for the non-offending players. Even then, hackers are allowed to purchase new accounts and keep on creating massive amounts of havoc as punishment is lingering at best and there are no immediate counter-measures to deal with these situations.-----------------------------------------------------------------4. System Design.If you were to ask me what personally disgusts me the most about this game, It has to be without the shadow of a doubt, the ""Bad Sport"" system. How does it work? It bans you from the regular multiplayer (including private sessions with your friends), separating you from everyone else if you blow up other player's cars, leave online games early or simply get reports.Sounds like a necessary thing on paper with GTA being what it is, but oh the cancer that can be find if you observe it more closely. Here are 4 scenarios where the game will punish you and cut out your ability to play Online:a) Defend yourself from someone trying to drive-by you in an armored kuruma by blowing them up with a grenade: You're a bad sport.b) Stay AFK in a tank or some other heavy vehicle and have people drive under you with their own cars and explode as a result: You're a bad sport.c) Have your game crash during a multiplayer session due to GTA V's notorious memory leak: You're a bad sport.d) Own a couple of guys in fair death-matches or similar over the thousands of hours you spent in GTA V and have them spam reports against you with no legitimacy to them whatsoever: You're a bad sport.-----------I thought this was a beta thing at first, perhaps a myth or something exclusively on the console.. But one faithful day when I just finished a mission and was outside my apartment, fiddling with my settings, a guy rams into my car from behind using an armored kuruma and proceeds to try and mow me down with an SMG. I pull out a sticky bomb, slap it onto his windshield, drive away and proceed to detonate the bomb as he continues trying to kill me. Boom, he dies along with his Armored Kuruma (which is nigh impossible to only kill the players within using guns)... And:YOU HAVE BEEN FLAGGED AS A BAD-SPORT. Bye bye playing with friends, bye bye actual multiplayer (as everyone who is a bad sport just waits their time out or jumps onto another account/plays offline), bye bye GTA Online as a whole. The first ban you'll get will be 2-3 days (48-72 hours) that cannot be reduced (used to be possible by getting awards, etc, not anymore), next one will be weeks, then months, then years and they will be that much more easy to get after your first one. The timer can be extended if you continue being a ""Bad sport"" by blowing up people's cars and It will very frequently get stuck as well, sometimes even resetting if you do certain jobs, missions or activities. It is one of THE most hated 'functions' of GTA V Online and Rockstar does absolutely NOTHING about it.It is even a walking contradiction itself as the design goal of it is to dissuade people from doing, and I quote here: ""Doing Unsanctioned Mayhem"". The problem here is that THERE IS NO SYSTEM OR DETECTION METHOD IN-PLACE TO EVEN REMOTELY DETERMINE IF A CERTAIN MAYHEM WAS SANCTIONED OR NOT IN THE GAME.Now Rockstar have also recently broken the game even further with FPS killing patches.Just.. Ugh."

Not to mention that they sent private investigators to stop the creators of the original FiveM mod. Lets not support these scummy practices.UPDATE: Good news, Rockstar/Take-Two have now allowed OpenIV to get back in development. I'm still leaving this as a negative tho, because I still think this game has the most greedy implementation of micro-transactions I've seen in a Triple A game. Singleplayer is good so get it for that, but shark cards are way overpriced as the amount of ingame money you get from them is pathetic compared to the prices of items that have been released in the last few updates."

There just arent too many ways to generate cash in the game while actually having genuine fun. It's at its best when you find that 1 out of 1000 lobbies where everyone is just messing around and you get a truly fun experience with randoms.That being said, the story mode is great. Lovable characters, interesting conflicts, great gameplay, and an overall story that is just easy to be able to get into.

The story is great and is full of fun and challenging content. I continued to play for the online content after I finished the story. It was a lot of fun playing with friends whether it's messing around and driving, or doing the heists. BUT, the game started to change for the worse. Money is hard to get so theres very few ways to make money in fun ways, one way was heists on double $/RP weekends, however new heists were never added and so they began to get stale and felt more like a grind for money instead of being fun. In addition to that, if you were playing on a public server there was a high chance of someone being a modder and giving everyone hundreds of thousands of dollars, even if you never asked. To be honest, that was the best way anyone got money without grinding out hundreds of monotonous missions or exploiting old glitches in the game e.g: selling expensive cars (Which hasn't been possible for a few years now.).I understand that R* wants to make money, but the base game is still $60 dispite being released for console late 2014, and PC Early 2015. It has a lot of issues that they can fix, but they don't.( like the long loading times, not being fun, going into single player to make a multiplayer lobby, etc.) Instead they want to punish people who got money illegitamitely, ( so they can make more money from their dumb shark cards...) even if they never asked for the money from modders... And if you didn't spend all that money on cars or other very pricey new 'free' DLC gear, it's most likely all gone, except for about 20K in funds. Yeah, okay I get it- You have to work hard in the game to make money, that wouldn't be so bad if every way to make money is boring. On top of that, any new content is gonna cost well over 1 million points to get. In my opinion, R* taking away illegit money away is just a superficial fix. People modded money because getting it is too boring and hard, and you need a lot of money to have any fun.Maybe I'm just♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥that they took away my legitamite money I ground out with friends doing the pacific standard heist, even though I got money from a modder on the public server over a year before. But I know that any desire my friends and I had to play this game, is now gone.TL;DR: if you want to play the game for the single player get the game some other way so you don't have to pay the full price. If you want the game for the online content I wouldn't recommend it. It's fun at first cause it is new, but it will get stale really fast once you see all the flaws."

I sucked it up and went back to playing.

Story mode? Just play one time and forget forever - its very far from masterpiece. Gameplay? Car physics is not good, damage model is very strange, etc.Online? It does not worth the money paid for the game. Very monotonic gameplay, lack of missions, not just unfriendly players but highest concentration of cheaters/haxors in freeroam session, stripped down gameplay, player is strongly relied on farming and/or microtransactions (hello, korean MMORPGs!), bans for nothing or just for being victim of cheaters (whereas cheaters are not banned in most cases. I know even case when player was banned for official ""Criminal Mastermind"" achievement because technical support decided 10 million bonus from achievement is too much), inadequate technical support... And this is just a peak of an iceberg! The only way to play online mode in GTA 5 is to play with trusted friends, but there is still no guarantee to dont get ban in future.Mods? Forget about mods. TakeTwo and Rockstar decided that any player has no rights to modify game, and in future they can even harm ordinary players for mods - they already do it with developers of modding tools.I can give only one advice about this game: DONT BUY IT! And i dont recommend to buy any next game from Rockstar and TakeTwo. A lot of players bought GTA 5, they made ""The most selling game"" real for Rockstar. How players were rewarded for this?

Bear in mind, I don't even know how to install mods or cheats, nor have I ever griefed or trash-talked other players (though I cannot say I haven't been on the receiving end of such distasteful behaviour).To say I was irate would be an understatement, I was absolutely ballistic, having been wronged by such a unscrupulous judicial system. I went to their support page immediately to appeal against my false ban, and lo and behold, as soon as my request was submitted, an automated message bounced right back.It was then when I realised that no matter how hard I try, Rockstar would do absolutely nothing about it. While I am sure that players like me who get falsely banned are in the minority, it is absolutely appalling that Rockstar has absolutely no interest in resolving such cases. What is the point of playing again after the false ban expires? There is no point, I tell you, for they might ban me for no reason yet again, and that ban will be permanent.So, should you buy the game? Absolutely not. They wrongfully banned me, and who knows, they might wrongfully ban you too. It's a damn shame, because I thoroughly enjoyed playing the game, but now I have lost all my trust in them.

It's become a scheme and they are trying to destroy outside modding communities that have no connection to the money used in the GTA Online experience, they're just being♥♥♥♥♥♥♥---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The most devestating things about GTAV for PC is Rockstars lack of support for creative community servers. There has never been a game more ripe with potential for custom servers that simply does not support it. Life servers on GTAV would be groundbreaking. A completely amazing Role Play experience, tossed out the window by a company primarily focused on draining the players of their money by keeping a tight grasp on every players in-game currency.You might say, ""you are buying this title for the single player and the expansive world"". No, I bought this on XBox 360 and PS4 for those things, I bought the PC version for FPS and community servers. It was written in stone that Rockstar would support online servers and mods. What they actually support is their 100% vanilla, Social Club Economy-driven, play style and absolutely no modding on the online front at all. What they meant was, they don't care what you do with your single player, but multiplayer is off limits. Really? Biggest♥♥♥♥♥♥move ever made, seriously.If you've played it before on any other platform, skip it, PC version is VERY MUCH NOT WORTH IT.

A freaking decade later??? I do not support such vile acts."
19,422.5,Not Recommended, March 30,6,"The GTA Online is broken on so many levels. If I were asked to make a short list of things that are wrong I would say, FROM THE TOP OF MY HEAD:1. First most important, remove all millitary aircfarts and vehicles from the Free Roam. I'm talking about tanks, jets, APCs, bombers etcetera. Why? It doesn't make sense to have these things flying and rolling around in a city limits and country. Because, this here is a civilian territory. Imagine this happening in real world, lowlife biker band moving small weed shipment to distribute and suddenly all these millitary vehicles starts pursuing it. It doesn't make any sense the servicing cost of millitary aircraft is HUGE comparing to value of van full of weed bags, and not counting the price of such airplane. THIS IS AN OVERKILL. It's like destroying the truck full of stuffed toys with a nuclear bomb, the damage is too insignificant compared to the efforts. They can be removed completely from the game or placed in a special type of millitary missions/jobs where you fight other players. All of this shouldn't apply though to regular aircrafts like civilian planes and helicopters, they can stay in free roam. If you want to play warfare go play Battlefiled or War Thunder for GOD'S SAKES.2. Second thing which directly stems from the first. Grievers. With all these unbalanced OP vechicles and aircrafts it's too easy to grieve people online. I played a lot of CS:GO (near 1300 hours) which has it's infamous toxic community, BUT compared to GTA it seems like a picnic. GTA has cancer community, it brings out the worst in people. It encourages you to grieve other players, to completely ruin their expirience. After GTAO I honestly think that CS:GO community is NOT SO BAD after all!3. Cheaters. Third thing comes out from the second. Of course if you have so much ""bad sports"" they inclined to use cheats to gain an unfair advantage. Although I think it's mostly Rockstar's fault because they seem to be too lazy to install any kind of anticheat system. OR, the system is in place but it just DOESN'T WORK AT ALL! I heard that Rockstar tracks various stats trying to detect them, but it's also not working because I see the players with inflated bank accounts and 8000 lvls everyday. What can be easier than detect players that get insane increase of cash and RP in short period of time???4. Prices. Actually I am okay with prices, to support the development of new content players can donate more money. It's ok. BUT, one BUT, with cheating problem mentioned above high prices only hurt HONEST PLAYERS who refuse to use modded money. That's kinda messed up if you ask me. It's like GTA jacked up prices encourage you to use cheats otherwise you're gonna have a huge disatvantange in PvP.5. Armored vehicles. Everybody knows that armored vehicles like Kuruma and Duke are OP. They're used by every troll and griever, and make transportation of a cargo too easy and boring. Besides, they dont make much sense. You have an armored plates on the windshield, now there are few problems with that- it obstructs the view in the FPV- it's unrealistic to have a vehicle with front view obstructed, such a vehicle would never legally be allowed on the roads of city- you can shoot from the inside of the car perfectly but the bullets coming from the ouside can't hit you? LIKE WHATS UP WITH THAT??? at least they could make it only transportation vehicle so you can go from point A to point B safely on the price of not being able to shoot from the car- ok, if you drive in a third person you don't get bothered with obstructed windhield, but then again why restrict the ""tinted windows"" upgrade to side and rear on other cars in mod shops??? you can't put a tint on a windshield, why??? DMV won't allow it??? it doesn't MAKE ANY SENSE6. FLYING MOTROCYCLES WITH MISSILES ONBOARD??? LIKE what the hell?! Have you lost your freaking mind? What is wrong with Rockstar content developers?! Besides that, everybody knows that Opperssor is completely imbalanced and OP vehicle. The content in this game is so ridicolous and stupid that it only attracts 5 yr old kids!!!7. Weapons. Weapons stupid and unrealistic. Sticky bombs, there are no such things as throwable sticky bombs in real life. Besides them being OP that makes every other throwable weapon useless they really doesn't make much sense. You can't put these ridiculous weapons in the game, what if they put a railgun in the game from Quake??? That would disrupt the balance and atmosphere of the game, just like sicky bombs. Minigun, OP stupid unrealistic weapon can shred any player, vehicle or aircraft to pieces. There is no such thing as handheld minigun in real life!!! ONLY MOUNTED! These things make game a ridiculous and chaotic pile of bullcrap.8. FPV view is made horribly bad. Why make something that noone's gonna use because it sucks so much??? I am all for FPV in games but in GTA it has very narrov visibillity I feel like I'm lookin through the magnifying glass. First person in a car also very bad, since vehicle's side and rearview mirrors dont work you have a huge blind spot behind your left shoulder, so it's very hard to change lane to the left in traffic.9. Story mode. The story in a single player is kind of rly boring compared to other games in GTA series. Characters are completely mediocre and undistinguished. Story doesn't evoke any interest, so you go through it just because you paid for the game. Recent game I played which has a GTA-like gameplay is Sleeping Dogs. Now that's a story, that's how you make a scenario for the single player. It's so interesting and exciting that you even discount the absense of multiplayer. You don't care about multiplayer if the game has single player THAT GOOD. The same thing I would say about the Mafia II, it also has the brilliant story and atmosphere. Comparing to these 2 games GTA SP is crap."

They might have one, if they do, this is news to me. Why? Because the amount of hackers I've found in the game, either they're dropping millions of dollars for everyone, or (like they normally do) blow everyone up with a ""kill all"" button blowing entire lobbies of players up countless times till that lobby is completely empty, I like the game I do, GTA is one of my favorite non medieval games, but when playing online, with the amount of hackers or ""modders"" as the community calls them, I really don't care what you call them, a hacker, modder, cheater, exploiter, glitcher, I don't care it's all the same thing, a law breaking player who breaks the game. GTA has a lot, in my opinion, generally when I play through out a day I find roughly 1-2 per lobby of more than 15 players... It's awful. It's like DarkSouls2 Scholar of the First Sin all over again, same deal too, it was a good game, but when pvp came into play, there are a lot of cheaters...

Sadly there are some huge downsides to it for anyone considering joining in.Rock*(Take-Two Interactive?) really wants to push Shark Card sales. I assume this is the main reason they have for forcing you to do the CEO and Biker bussiness money making methods in Public lobbies, so normal players and hackers alike can ruin your chances of grinding out some GTA cash. Hours of your life down the drain because one jerk in a jet plane decides he's bored. (The jerk in question already cheated to own everything, and the progression is gone, so all he has left to do in game is screw with people who are trying to earn their stuff)On top of that, you also have the ""nice"" hackers. The ones that pop in and start raining money bags from the sky, or worse just depositing money right into your account. Then Rockstar starts threatening you with an account wipe because you cheated, when THEY are the idiots forcing us into a Public lobby in a game that they cannot control hackers in.Rockstar. Do the right thing. Allow CEO and Biker stuff to be done in Friend/Invite only lobbies. Heck, ramp up the NPC violence towards us if you want to try and balance it or whatever, I don't care.

Two weeks ago I received a monthly ban, for the generic reason of ""Violation of EULA"". No other specific reasons were given to me or could I find out on my own.What actually happend the previous day, was a modder joining my session. He spawned fireplaces, jet engines and other random stuff inside of everyone in the session, which led to killing people even in safehouses or in passive mode and not even giving chance to report the guy (The report must be done via ingame menu and once you're killed, menu is closed and you're forced into death screen). On top of that he unlocked all the weapons for everyone in the session.Next day was fine, I was playing with friend. At some point a high reputation level guy picked on us. We decided to smack him, and we did it pretty well. What I basically was doing, was stalking him (as he did before) and headshoting him, since he was barely moving at all. He reported me for cheats along with his friend, who was giving him solid support this way. That was evening.The next morning I tried to login to Online I saw message about being suspended for a month. No particular reasons given. I sent multiple tickets and I called the customer service just to be ignored. For all the questions I asked I received same responses: ""It's not within our duty to answer/do this"", ""We don't have such knowledge"". The support only told me about what can be possible reasons for banning, and warned me to play fair.I was banned from Online for a month after about a week or so from starting it and grinding in it. I never used hacks nor I have modded the game in any way. Whole my progress from playing plenty of hours daily is wiped. Next ban I will get will be permament, even if it's unjust and I CAN'T even appeal it.Imagine all the veterans (numerous of people actually got banned for nothing) loosing their progress or even access to game.ALL THE ACCOUNT BANS AND SUSPENSIONS ARE FINAL AND ARE NOT TO BE APPEALED.The game has got automatic anti-cheat which is not supervised by any means. Anti-cheat doesn't check content of your folder nor of the game and neither it checks changes in game engine or any addons. It bans you based on your stats in game. THIS SYSTEM IS VERY FAULTY AND YOU CAN'T APPEAL THE BANS!TL;DR - You can get banned for modders in sessions affecting your account or even for being incredible player. Bans are final and cannot be appealed. Your progress and characters (all) are wiped. You can get only two bans, second is permamentIf you're into GTA V single player story and you're willing to pay the price for it alone and treat Online as addition, go ahead, pay the money, game is wonderful.

And now Take Two decided to send the devolopers of OpenIV a cease and desist. OpenIv being a very powerful tool meant for modding the singleplayer portion of GTA V, and had failsafes to prevent users who modded their game from using online to prevent it being exploited for cheating. Despite that, Take Two deemed OpenIV a cheating tool, despite OpenIV having no effect whatsoever on the Online portion of the game. All while the hacking and cheating scene on GTA: O continues to grow and the massive grind to obtain in game currency needed to buy some of the content in the ""Free"" updates has gotten so bad that many players, (including me in my time playing GTA:O) have actually CHEERED and praised modders who were spawning cash for players just so they could actually afford the more fun things in the game.Now that Take Two has effectivly shut down OpenIV and thus modding of the game in terms of things like replacing vehicles, player models, ect. And in no doubt the scripthooks and other such mods will potentially recieve cease and desists in the future as well, effectivly killing off modding GTA V all together.Now let me just make it clear that this is NOT Rockstar's fault. Rockstar has made a great game, and have for many years fully supported modding of their games, to the point of even showcasing some of the popular mods on their own websites. And as well as all the new content we find in the game is awesome. But sadly Take Two are still pulling the strings and all they want is more money.If you haven't bought this game already, Don't.

Profiles are being hacked left and right on the official servers, with no help from Rockstar. Not to mention TakeTwo being complete tw4ts with anything that doesn't drive sales of Shark Cards. It's become a scheme and they are trying to destroy outside modding communities that have no connection to the money used in the GTA Online experience, they're just being♥♥♥♥♥♥♥---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The most devestating things about GTAV for PC is Rockstars lack of support for creative community servers. There has never been a game more ripe with potential for custom servers that simply does not support it. Life servers on GTAV would be groundbreaking. A completely amazing Role Play experience, tossed out the window by a company primarily focused on draining the players of their money by keeping a tight grasp on every players in-game currency.You might say, ""you are buying this title for the single player and the expansive world"". No, I bought this on XBox 360 and PS4 for those things, I bought the PC version for FPS and community servers. It was written in stone that Rockstar would support online servers and mods. What they actually support is their 100% vanilla, Social Club Economy-driven, play style and absolutely no modding on the online front at all. What they meant was, they don't care what you do with your single player, but multiplayer is off limits. Really? Biggest♥♥♥♥♥♥move ever made, seriously.If you've played it before on any other platform, skip it, PC version is VERY MUCH NOT WORTH IT. The game has an amazing story that is movie worthy, but the online experience is one of the most tragic stories in gaming history. When Rockstar held GTAV ransom for in-game purchases.

201,831.1,Not Recommended," December 23, 2016",6,"So, after waiting for ages to sit down and do a proper review of GTA V, which I have acquired a decent amount of hours on, here's my rant.1. Optimization- I run this game on my ""High End"" gaming/workstation rig consisting of an i7 6800K, 64GB of RAM, and a 980ti Hybrid (Soon to be 1070). This game for the most part runs smooth, but its so damn glitchy. Having it installed on an SSD doesn't even improve load times in the slightest bit, I crash so damn often and I don't even know what's causing it half the time. When I do manage to load in, I get constant black screen loops and other glitches that lead to crashes and makes it a total hassle to even try to play the game due to having to wait nearly 10 minutes to load in after every crash. I love this game dearly, but for the love of PC Master Race, R* please optimize it.2. Recent Banwave.- A ton of players have been subjects to R* banwave. Some clearly deserve it and its great to see them being brought to justice, but in return, lots of innocent player's have been banned due to multiple flags being set off. One of my own friends got money dropped on him by an unknown hacker, then the hacker reported him, and he got banned within the next day. I've also read multiple reviews here regarding false bans and It's truly shocking to see how R* treats their players. Ban them, then provide no evidence or even try to work with them.I probably will update this whenever more rants come to me.TL;DRR* fix your game, and stop banning people who are innocent."

We decided to smack him, and we did it pretty well. What I basically was doing, was stalking him (as he did before) and headshoting him, since he was barely moving at all. He reported me for cheats along with his friend, who was giving him solid support this way. That was evening.The next morning I tried to login to Online I saw message about being suspended for a month. No particular reasons given. I sent multiple tickets and I called the customer service just to be ignored. For all the questions I asked I received same responses: ""It's not within our duty to answer/do this"", ""We don't have such knowledge"". The support only told me about what can be possible reasons for banning, and warned me to play fair.I was banned from Online for a month after about a week or so from starting it and grinding in it. I never used hacks nor I have modded the game in any way. Whole my progress from playing plenty of hours daily is wiped. Next ban I will get will be permament, even if it's unjust and I CAN'T even appeal it.Imagine all the veterans (numerous of people actually got banned for nothing) loosing their progress or even access to game.ALL THE ACCOUNT BANS AND SUSPENSIONS ARE FINAL AND ARE NOT TO BE APPEALED.The game has got automatic anti-cheat which is not supervised by any means. Anti-cheat doesn't check content of your folder nor of the game and neither it checks changes in game engine or any addons. It bans you based on your stats in game. THIS SYSTEM IS VERY FAULTY AND YOU CAN'T APPEAL THE BANS!TL;DR - You can get banned for modders in sessions affecting your account or even for being incredible player. Bans are final and cannot be appealed. Your progress and characters (all) are wiped. You can get only two bans, second is permamentIf you're into GTA V single player story and you're willing to pay the price for it alone and treat Online as addition, go ahead, pay the money, game is wonderful. However you can be ripped for no reason from the online part of the game."

It's publisher is a greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that views us, the consumer as greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s if we aren't spending money 24/7 on GTA: Online. And now Take Two decided to send the devolopers of OpenIV a cease and desist. OpenIv being a very powerful tool meant for modding the singleplayer portion of GTA V, and had failsafes to prevent users who modded their game from using online to prevent it being exploited for cheating. Despite that, Take Two deemed OpenIV a cheating tool, despite OpenIV having no effect whatsoever on the Online portion of the game. All while the hacking and cheating scene on GTA: O continues to grow and the massive grind to obtain in game currency needed to buy some of the content in the ""Free"" updates has gotten so bad that many players, (including me in my time playing GTA:O) have actually CHEERED and praised modders who were spawning cash for players just so they could actually afford the more fun things in the game.Now that Take Two has effectivly shut down OpenIV and thus modding of the game in terms of things like replacing vehicles, player models, ect. And in no doubt the scripthooks and other such mods will potentially recieve cease and desists in the future as well, effectivly killing off modding GTA V all together.Now let me just make it clear that this is NOT Rockstar's fault. Rockstar has made a great game, and have for many years fully supported modding of their games, to the point of even showcasing some of the popular mods on their own websites. And as well as all the new content we find in the game is awesome. But sadly Take Two are still pulling the strings and all they want is more money.If you haven't bought this game already, Don't. Save your money for something better. Modding GTA games has always been a HUGE selling point on the PC. But thanks to Take Two not anymore."

It does not worth the money paid for the game. Very monotonic gameplay, lack of missions, not just unfriendly players but highest concentration of cheaters/haxors in freeroam session, stripped down gameplay, player is strongly relied on farming and/or microtransactions (hello, korean MMORPGs!), bans for nothing or just for being victim of cheaters (whereas cheaters are not banned in most cases. I know even case when player was banned for official ""Criminal Mastermind"" achievement because technical support decided 10 million bonus from achievement is too much), inadequate technical support... And this is just a peak of an iceberg! The only way to play online mode in GTA 5 is to play with trusted friends, but there is still no guarantee to dont get ban in future.Mods? Forget about mods. TakeTwo and Rockstar decided that any player has no rights to modify game, and in future they can even harm ordinary players for mods - they already do it with developers of modding tools.I can give only one advice about this game: DONT BUY IT!

The open worlds of previous GTAs is expanded and improved in this one, and there are some fun vehicles.As for the online part, it generally follows the pay to win mechanic of mobile games, where anyone who can drop some money on a Shark Card can get a Hydra/Deluxo/Oppressor/whatever and continuously grief anyone trying to do ANYTHING other than PVP (had one guy land a helicopter outside a clothing store at one point and shoot a missile at me while I was buying some shoes). Heists are fun if you can get into a mission with people who don't rage-quit or run directly into the bullets, and the races are great, but it's not enough to save the game.

Not sure why this is a thing.-before making simple checks to see if a session is full or if friends are playing, GTAV Online will end your current session, forcing you to have to load in again if the search for a new session fails, instead of just letting you do it while still in the current session.-Loading screens are kind of long-So many weird issues happen during multiplayer missions, including players spawning without the correct gear, spawning in the wrong locations or simply not spawning (messing up the game for everyone else).

104,163.2,Not Recommended," June 14, 2015",6,"Other than the scummy attitude of the devs, this game has some serious flaws.1)""YOUR DATA COULD NOT BE LOADED FROM THE ROCKSTAR CLOUD SERVER. TRY AGAIN LATER"" is a frequent screen. 75% of the time I load the game, this happens and I get thrown to another loading screen for a few minutes and then thrown into story mode. I bought this game for the sole purpose of playing with friends, and that is out of the question most of the time.2)Online is plagued by hackers who can blow you up form the other side of the map, delete your cars, delete your weapons and even your cash. They freeze the game for you and make it unplayable.3)Online is a grind. You get tiny amounts of money for missions that need to be repeated and repeated to be able to buy a car that wont leave you a sitting duck.Why should I have to spend days playing this to just earn what a hacker can earn in 10 seconds? There is no easy way to report them either, so its a ""live with it or don't play the game"" scenario.Rockstar are more interested in adding content that is ridiculously overpriced and encourages Micro Transactions in order to use, than dealing with the hackers.If you still decide to get the game after this, then take note. 90% of people will shoot you on sight. You can be driving around in a trash truck, trying to obey the rules of the road and someone will drive past and throw a c4 onto your truck, only to detonate it as they watch from their rear view mirrors. If they don't do this, they will be driving a bulletproof car and spray you, leaving you helpless.Good luck."

Seeing as how all the non-hiest jobs pay dirt and the hiests require a 4 man team, I decided to sell two of my best cars (about $5,000,000 worth with the upgrades), for which I was given a petty $2,300,000 which is under half of what I paid. I sucked it up and went back to playing. I signed on today (less than a week later) to a notification saying ""Rockstar Game Services have corrected [my] GTA Dollars by -$2252009"" which is a solid 95% of the money I got from the cars.

99,651.9,Not Recommended, March 23,6,"I got the game mainly for the online mode (I was naive at the time), but tried the single player. This was the first game where I could not stand a SINGLE of the characters -playable or supporting, and while some of the missions were interesting in terms of mechanics and situations, I could not care at all about the story. The open worlds of previous GTAs is expanded and improved in this one, and there are some fun vehicles.As for the online part, it generally follows the pay to win mechanic of mobile games, where anyone who can drop some money on a Shark Card can get a Hydra/Deluxo/Oppressor/whatever and continuously grief anyone trying to do ANYTHING other than PVP (had one guy land a helicopter outside a clothing store at one point and shoot a missile at me while I was buying some shoes). Heists are fun if you can get into a mission with people who don't rage-quit or run directly into the bullets, and the races are great, but it's not enough to save the game. Plus the freemode lobbies are riddled with modders are running into someone with a teleporting tank or in god mode is definitely not an uncommon occurrence."
8,39.5,Not Recommended, March 24,6,"Banned after 9 hr of just playing racing games, No issues with the game, people were pleasant, the mechanics are good, I already own this game on 360 and wanted to play online - which was fun.Then after two sessions I'm banned - I can't find out why, I don't even know how to cheat, I'm not allowed to ask why I was banned, and I'm $50 out of pocket.This sucks!EDIT;They are now editing support requests and closing them - I created one under 'OTHER' - they copied and pasted the EULA statement again, changed the title to ""GRAND THEFT AUTO ONLINE - PC - CHEAT/EXPLOIT REPORT OR BANNING ISSUE"" and closed it.At this point I can only guess they banned me for having a PC as I had only brought the game two days previously and I definitely hadn't modded anything, I hadn't killed another player, hadn't done more than play racing games.Not sure if it's relevant, but during my entire gameplay I received a phonecall every few minutes from looping characters telling me I had to buy a bunker immediately.So I guess in 30 days they'll ban me again, and I'll have thrown away $50.Oh, the reason my hours are climbing now is due to my playing in single & director mode (steam won't refund as I was over 2hr)"

When they charged exorbitant amounts of in-game money for items online, I would grind for hours. When I heard characters make degrading jokes about people like me, I gritted my teeth and looked past it. I did all of this because I knew that on the other side of these things was freedom. I didn't have to be like the other people in this world, or the other players online. I could buy a cheap pickup truck and drive down the highway, looking out over the ocean on a beautiful sunset as I eagerly anticipated arriving at my modest home in Paleto Bay. I could download some files off the internet and my single-player game would have me going to work at an office, obeying traffic laws, living out of my car while saving for a one-bedroom apartment. I put up with everything because I paid sixty dollars for it, and this game was mine. With the recent actions Take-Two and Rockstar have taken against the modding community in favor of a micro-transaction fueled online environment, I can no longer take ownership of my copy in good conscious. GTA is no longer a game full of freedom for me where I can really be myself, it's a game where I can pay Take-Two more than sixty dollars for less of an experience. Don't buy this. Please."

249,507.7,Not Recommended," December 21, 2016",6,"While Grand Theft Auto V is a good idea and started out well, now it's barely worth $15, let alone $60.Pros :- Great singleplayer with memorable characters and fun missions. In my opinion the best thing about the game.- Great graphics, extremely well optimized- Gameplay is fun, but I highly recommend using a controller, especially for driving and flying.Cons :- Multiplayer is a mess, and in my opinion isn't even worth playing.- Everything in GTA:O is expensive, from cars to clothes to guns and to apartments.- Despite the high prices, making money is done through repeated grinding of heists and missions. While your first time doing Pacific Standard heist will be tension-filled, high-paced, and satisfying at the end, you won't feel any of these emotions when you've been doing the heist over and over again for hours, just to buy a plane or a car.- Activities such as CEO missions and Biker missions are at best repetitve and at worse simply not worth doing. With a good helicopter there's no reason to do anything other than the CEO missions for money, and even then it takes hours to make a profit, if your entire shipment doesn't get destroyed by a griefer in a hydra jet or a hacker.- Hackers run rampant. Expect having to change servers frequently to get away from players who teleport around, blow up your cars, and strip players of their weapons.- Always, but especially now, you run the risk of your account being banned for no reason. When this happens, don't expect Rockstar support to help. Even characters that have hundreds of levels and millions of dollars risk being deleted for suspected ""hacking"", and have no hope of being restored.TL;DR : Buy it when it's on sale for the singleplayer campaign. Avoid GTA : Online like the plague."
136,485.4,Not Recommended," June 17, 2017",6,"This is the major example of a wasted potential in AAA game. Don't get me wrong - the singleplayer is one of the most intense ones I have ever played. However, the decisions made for the online mode are the prime examples of what not to do with a great product - and how to drive your creation straight to the trash can. Here are the biggest cons that were not present at the release of the game, but are now a thing due to the most mindboggling decisions made by Rockstar Games and Take-Two:- The studio only supports online mode, and any new DLC vehicles since the beggining of 2016 are not being released to the singleplayer, therefore players which want to test new vehicles before buying them have to mod single player - which Take-Two just made almost impossible by shutting down OpenIV, a modding tool used to mod GTA games since 2009.- Even with the shift to online, singleplayer is still a lot more immersing. Rockstar encourages players to only play online by releasing free DLC's only to that mode - but online still feels like a cheaper version of the singleplayer experience. Even the simple things, like animals not being present in online since 2013, make online appear much less polished than the singleplayer.- Another big problem are the Shark Cards - the prices of them are just plain stupid. Overall, the pricing of vehicles shifted a lot after the heist update in 2015. The prices of Shark Cards did not change since 2013. Before the heist update, the biggest 8MLN in-game dollars Megalodon Shark Card could buy you almost all of the in-game content for 100$. All of the content from the newest DLC, Gunrunning, costs around 40MLN in-game dollars - which translates roughly to 500$. We have to remember that all of the DLC's since the release of the game are free - that ""unfortunately"" does not justify the content hiding behind a 500$ paywall.- If you are one of those people that do not want to spend any money via microtransactions, turn away from this title. Everything is hiding behind a neverending grind. In-game jobs pay nothing, and still, after 2 years, the best way to make money is by grinding heists - which released in 2015. The community is so upset at this fact that every two online lobbies, you will see people begging modders to drop them money.- Adding to the topic of modders - online mode is filled with them. I, personally, have a mixed opinion about them. Rockstar can't control them since the release for PC. Modders can create the most hilarious and fun moments of online - or they can simply wipe your account and even steal your IP adress - as you can see, they are totally out of Rockstar's control.- Last thing I am going to write about is purely subjective, and is about the content added in the new DLC's. I am one of those ""rare"" casual players that would like to drive vehicles into the back of the Titan (which is not possible since the release of the game) or go offroading and hunting in the countryside with a couple of friends (as I said before, hunting is not possible due to animals not being present in the online mode). Instead, we get new super cars added in almost every DLC. For me, GTA has always been about having fun - not grinding missions to unlock the ""fun"" content. Even simple things like custom lobbies with police, player icons or friendly fire disabled - which were present in GTA IV - are not possible in GTA Online.Thank you for reading my review. As I said, in my opinion, GTA V is the best example of a wasted potential I have ever seen in a video game. This game released in 2013 and with the right development could still be one of the top contenders for the best sandbox, best racing game and even the best fps (because of the next gen option of first person camera mode). Unfortunately, in my opinion, it will not be any of those any soon. Also, adding more context to my review - I have been playing this game since the release, both on Xbox 360 and PC. I think that with the recent shutdown of OpenIV, it is the highest time the community should speak up and protest against the greed of Rockstar and Take-Two.Sincerely, a disappointed GTA fan."
