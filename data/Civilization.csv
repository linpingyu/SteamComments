115,"1,553.6",Not Recommended," October 9, 2017",2,"tl;dr: Just play Civ V instead.Well, I've been trying to love this game for 642 hours now (as opposed to 3532 hours wasted/enjoyed in Civ V). Some observations about this game as it stands alone, now that the adjustment period from Civ V is out of the way:- AI's military tactics are still extremely weak. It does not assemble its units for advantage, attack when it has the advantage, or defend its cities effectively. You'd think a fundamental goal for any game like this would be to have fronts naturally develop, as in a real-life war. Nope. Scattered, random skirmishes that the AI always loses. You can run the map with 1-2 infantry or cavalry units, plus 1 artillery.- Diplomacy mechanics bring nothing to the game. If you so much as defend yourself or retaliate against an aggressor, as one does in war, you're branded a warmonger. Were the Allies warmongers in WWII for conquering Germany? Leaders relentlessly spam you with their disapproval, consuming ridiculous numbers of UI-animation seconds before you can esc/cancel with each one. Despite claims that leaders approve of certain things, it seems to be an either/or, all-or-nothing, hair-trigger mechanism. A leader will love you one turn and denounce you the next, because they expected you to have one more military unit that turn or something. There is no nuance, spectrum, or ""scoring"" to this system, as far as I can tell, contrary to the claim that there are several levels between ""friendly"" and ""denounced."" It's a waste of effort to try to get along with everyone while trying to win a science or cultural victory. Just let them inevitably declare war and fight them off.- Firaxis has figured out how to make leader interactions annoy you further and waste even more of your time. Clearly, you want to be spammed with an inconsequential 30-second message for ""good job"" ""or ""I hate you"" several times each turn - often interrupting your next click - and wait an additional several seconds for it to respond to multiple Esc presses.- The AI engine is SLOW. I've played on an i7-5930k and an i7-6850k, and on both, it takes up to a minute to process AI turns in late game. I think most hours spent playing this game are for the ""please wait"" stage. Why Firaxis cannot take advantage of parallel processing, or cache possible scenarios in advance while you're taking your turn, I do not know. There should at least be an option (or default) where other player moves have faster animations so that you can see what's happening without losing time, without making all the animations bizarrely short like in quick combat.- The lack of automated builders brings more tedium to the game than it does craftsmanship. In late game, I really no longer care about the details of each city; there are no real mistakes to be made, and I do not want to micromanage every single tile of every single city on a standard to huge map. Keeping the charge mechanic on builders, but adding an option to automate (or making it a technology, like a ""self-reliance"" civic) would probably still encourage early game caretaking, while removing late game tedium.- The game in general just feels slow and tedious. This is in no small part due to terrain penalties and weak road bonuses for unit movement. (And the fact you essentially can't deliberately construct roads; military engineer roads are too expensive.) Even in the middle ages, no, it didn't take 20 years for a unit to cross a civilization. It takes a lot of the oomph and fun out of army mobilization when it's far more practical to move single powerful units against the weak AI than to assemble melee and archer units into a tactically appropriate formation. There's simply no reason to bother with a combined arms / blitzkrieg approach in this game.- I like the districts mechanic in principle, but it's not flexible enough. Districts should be removable at a cost, or at the VERY least, there should be more information displayed in early game about the future optimal options for each tile. It's really not fun to try to wing it and guess where it will be best to place an industrial, commercial, or theater district in the future, before you can select those districts to see the adjacency bonuses. (Or for placing future wonders, each of which have strict, arbitrary requirements.) At the very least, there should be some sort of filter (a lens?) to display all adjacency bonuses on a tile.- Tile info popovers are slow and unreliable. Just show the dang info when I mouse over. I'm not afraid. At least make it so that mousing over a resource icon by accident doesn't prevent tile info from displaying until I leave the tile and reenter.- Personally, I think the air unit mechanics in this game feel awkward and unnatural. Why not just emulate real life instead? Carriers in real life can project power farther and to more places at once than allowed by the 2 short-range aircraft, as can air bases. Jet fighters intercept attacks, like in Civ V. They don't sit there and take it. No cruise missiles or ballistic conventional weapons in this game? They do exist in real life... Also, by the time you can build aerodromes and project significant air power, you could far more easily have created 3 times as many land units of greater power. The air game seems to be rather pointless, and is placed too late in the game in terms of military advancement. Air units are too weak for the time they take to acquire. Minor note: you'd also think cheap surveillance or attack drones would be making an appearance by now.- Nuclear weapons are thankfully a little more realistic in this game, since they really ruin whatever land you'd like to conquer, but at the same time, you've got to ask, of what use are they in the game? The AI never has a powerful enough conventional army where you'd need nukes to defend yourself. Since you can conquer all other civs with 3 army units, it's foolish to nuke them first and ruin your takings. Best guess, if you're trying to win a science or cultural victory, you'd like to ruin everyone else's day? If you're in the mood to go for one of those victories, initiating nuclear war doesn't really fit the bill.- In my experience, all games devolve into domination matches. As soon as someone attacks you (inevitable), you will have an army and be branded a warmonger for defending yourself. So you might as well remove the nuisance of neighboring civs who like to attack you. Nature then takes its course. Maybe this is a bit realistic, but it doesn't exactly meet the 4x, varied experience Firaxis is trying to accomplish.- City state and liberation mechanics are flawed. There is no real way to defend an allied city state, or even just to play peacekeeper. You're not notified that they are attacked, and you are not given any casus belli for declaring war. War of liberation (after the fact) also doesn't seem to become available when it should. If you do liberate a city, all your units are immediately expelled from that territory, bizarrely and unnaturally disrupting your advance in a way that just wouldn't happen in real life. Takes the fun out of liberating that neighboring continent that had been conquered by a single civ; liberating France as in WWII is literally impossible.- So tired of hearing ""best not to aid that city state"" from other leaders. What are you talking about? I didn't aid any city state. Which one???- The tech/civic boost mechanic is neat, but it makes games far too uneven. Either I hit all the boosts by the luck of the map and launch a moon landing or accidentally win a culture victory in 1700, or I'm tied up in a war for 500 years (in which I can't go on the offensive to end it or else become a warmonger), miss a lot of the boosts, and discover petroleum in 1960.I fired up this game this morning on a sick day to pass the time, and found that it's more fun to write this review than to sit through any more hours with the game. That should tell you something."
131,38.1,Not Recommended," October 21, 2017",221,"I'll preface by admitting that I'm a grumpy old civ4 elitist, but this game just isn't worth buying in its current state.There are a lot of very cool systems the designers have put up a rough foundation for, but it's still just too empty to really enjoy. You can really see the potential in this game, but there's still just so many little things missing or buggy that drive you nuts.And as always, the AI is dumb as rocks. They keep making the combat engine more and more complicated without adapting the AI to handle it at all. As a result, you can win wars with maybe 4-5 units. The AI is just not good enough to handle the system. All the depth of the combat mechanics just aren't satisfying because of this.It's like beating a dog in Chess. Your great strategy and tactics are simply wasted on an opponent that has no idea what it's doing.And a full year after release, there are still missing hotkeys for actions you will do *EVERY TURN*.The art is gorgeous. The soundtrack is amazing. The district system and the armies/fleets system show so much promise. But the game's just not deep enough, and the AI so poor that it's simply not enjoyable after one or two playthroughs.I cranked the difficulty up to diety on my 2nd playthrough, and still got bored and quit 200 turns in because of how far ahead of the AI I was. I played on Emperor in civ5, and I think Monarch in civ4. It's not like I've magically gotten better at the game. The AI is just *that* bad. It is utterly incapable of threatening you militarily, and does not know how to pursue win conditions at all.Again, there's a TON of potential. Really disappointing game as it stands though. Maybe with a couple of expansions it'll reach its full potential, but until then I cannot recommend this game."
113,217.2,Not Recommended," June 30, 2017",923,"I am not a frequent reviewer here on steam, but since this is a series i have played for decades and I have been with it through thick and thin I feel like this is one I have to review. Unfortunately in the current state of the game and the current DLC policy I have to give this game a hard not recommend. As with the last few Civs this game may be worth a purchase after a couple real expansion and when they release legit mod support, bu right now this gamejust shouldn't be purchased nlesson a steep sale and even then I would say you should wait for a better sale later.Reasons why you shouldn't buy this game:1. The biggest issue with this game is the AI. The AI in this game is attrocious, they can't manage the district system well, they can't manage their units well, they just can't play the game very well as a general rule. You can potentially solve this with Multiplayer, but unless all your civs are humans this will be an issue and a big one2. The second biggest issue with this game is the balance, there is very poor balance in the game, some civs are head and shoulders better than others, and sure it is sometimes nice to throw in a challening civ or two in a game like this as almost a short way of raising the difficulty bar without just adding Civ Cheats, but there are huge gaps between the great civs and the bad civs and it isn't even close.3. Lacking strategic choices. Once you get a few playthroughs in on this one you start realizing quickly that there is an optimal path through this game, early attacking a neighbor civilizaton is MUCH better than trying to make a friend, science victory is MUCH easier than other conditions, some policy choices you have to wonder why they even exist they are so much worse than alternatives. The game feels like there are options, but much as the rest of the balance issues from #2, they are not really good choices it is just the good choice and the why the heck did you do that choice. There is some balanced choices certainly, but so very many terrible ones.4. Religous Combat. OMG if your neighbor is a religious nut you will end up declaring war on him just to stop the sea of relgious units running around your zone, you can't give open borders to a neighbor for the same reason. The AI loves getting in your way to get in your way and if you give them an inch they will just sit in your borders to be a pain in the rear. But religous units are the worst, you have to micro manage them far too much by constantly running them accros the map to convert cities and fight the spam from other civs and it just isn't fun to manage or participate in. Almost makes you jsut let a neighbor give you their POS religion just to not worry aobut it but they still fill your map with their untis which means you can't even do that.5. Micromanaging in general, the game wants to make you ""make choices' because things like constantly telling your trade routes to make the most money is apparently a fun decision to make every 20 turn. This is a core design decision in thegame to basically make you ""interact"" with the ""decisions"" more frequently but again over and over again you are just chosing the one obivous choice and making that decision far more frequently than you should need to. It gets old quick and is a big issue with this game.So after all that, (and honestly there is more), this is actually a reasonably solid Civ game if you focus on MP and avoid its quirks, it can be playable and fun for a while, but once you see behind that curtain that sheen falls off fast and hard and the game quickly becomes ""wait until they finish it"". However, that is really my big reason for my review here, here we are approahcing a year (or 3/4s of one anyway) and they haven't really addressed the big issues with this game, the AI is still terrible, the balance is terrible, the strategies are still lacking. The quarterly patches are just no where near fast enough or good enough to move the game along.And then comes the DLC policy that is the final nail in the coffin for me, $9 for 2 civilizations and some maps? Are you kidding me, that is something a modder could add to the game with a few days of effort. The fact that this unfinished game that still isn't as good as either Civ IV or Civ V (or really even close) has $25 in DLC of civs just makes me think that I won't be spending anything more on Civ VI again. To be honest, Civ isn't the king of Civ anymore and this Civ is a long way from being the best Civ.This will probably be worth it in some gold edition in a few years after a couple expansions and the tiny over priced DLC included, but DO NOT spend full price or even close to it on this. Go buy Civ IV and get Fall From Heaven on it or buy Civ V and get Vox Populi on it, don't support this mess until they bother to fix it."
251,118.2,Not Recommended," March 28, 2017",672,"This game has some of the worst AI I have ever seen. The game introduced a newish idea, that each civilization, in addition to victory goals, would be driven by their own personal reasons. For example, the vikings like anyone with a strong navy, egypt anyone with a strong army, brazil hates anyone who gets lots of great people, and china hates anyone who builds a lot of wonders. This had potential to make games more complex, as it would allow you to form alliances that catered to your goal, and the goals of the AI.In practice, the system is horribly done. Let's go through a few turns of meeting the Vikings:Turn 1: Oh hi! We found the vikingsTurn 2: Oh they won't accept our gifts? That's weirdTurn 4: Vikings: ""Your navy is s***, we denounce you!""Turn 7: Vikings: ""Your navy is still s***, we declare war""You then spend about 20 turns at war, taking some citiesTurn 28: All other AI ""Warmonger. Warmonger. We declare war""How does that make any sense? Gorgo, one of the leaders of Sparta, will actually attack you for being weak, because they hate the weak. And the warmonger system makes 0 sense, as well. If someone declares war on you, and you take one of their cities in return, you are a warmonger. Did they capture some of your cities in a previous war, and you took them back? Warmonger. Another AI asked you to go to war with them to take out a second AI? Well now they both think you are a warmonger. It is absurd."
20,442.9,Recommended," June 27, 2017",2,"Ok, This is my very first review so it's gonna be extremely confusing and completely baseless.1.) Let's go with the basic simple review, is this better than Civ 5?- Eh, it's more flexible i guess. In Civ 5, i either kill everyone and conquer every cities on the planet or just turtle up myself with any number the tradition policies told me too. Districts system is good that you could give your cities their actual characteristic, probably the best part of Civ 6. Eureka systems are good but sometimes lead to repeatitive early game interactions like ""Try to kill barbarian with this Slinger"" or ""Make 2 Galleys"", some of them also depend on map RNG.2.)Is the game well-balanced?- Lol, nope. Some Civs are very strong since the Ancient Era while some are like playing without any bonuses until Renaissance. Babarian can be annoying most of the time, sometime they went full Genghis Khan and dunk 5 Horsemen into your face on very early game (I think Babarian condition that ""If they are any Horse resource nearby, they will make even more Horsemen"" are work even with horses in your cities). City-States do something weird as well, some will never make more than 5 units, some will make 10+ units and make traffic on the continent worse than morning rush hours, so ally with some City-state don't improve your army while some could eradicate some armies for you. City start could be very bad or extremely good, coastal start like Spain or England could be pretty bad.-Edit: Somehow 2K went buffing and nerfing some Civs, Norway, England and Spainish got buffs and Kongo got a nerf.(DLC Civs are still OP, no worry). Barbarians're still annoying, I don't think they touched this part anyway.3.)Is patching, bug fix or A.I improvement come fast?-Edit: 2K seem to give out the seasonal patch and update(?), some of it actually make the game better while some of them are pretty bad(like making Alliance with A.I. in latest patches which is pretty annoying)4.)2K sell so many DLCs, should I support them?- No idea, Just be yourself. The prices are a little higher than a TCG pack in my country, so i'm not that mad about it.5.)Should I purchase it now?-If it's on sale and you will play it right now, yes. If you want to play it later, No, wait for better patch or expansion.TL;DL: It's good game design and improvement over Civ5, but still need more patches and balancing. The decision is up to you, but for me it worth it, maybe.Edit: Ok after realize so many people actually read my gibberish review so I guess I will update the update, patching, and some other parts."
105,25.0,Not Recommended," December 31, 2017",346,"Nuked my own city just for fun. Was immediately contacted by two of the AI civs: Aztecs to congratulate the improved alignment of our interests and Nubia to congratulate the effectiveness of my districts.My biggest complaint with the game is that it feels like the game is playing me, rather than me playing the game. My actions were more driven by controling war declaration than doing what I want. Don't build enough of the right military units quick enough? AI declares war on you. Try to use your envoys on the city states? AI will declare war on you. Build wonders? AI will declare war on you. Upgrade your form of government because you are ahead in the civic tree? AI declares war on you. Have too many luxury resources? AI declares war on you. Not enough? AI declares war on you.Some people will enjoy the puzzly nature of babysitting the AI's temper tantrums or the frequent small wars with higher numbers of AI civs, but if you found yourself enjoying the more peaceful routes of Civ 5, I'd watch a lot of playthroughs on YouTube before buying. No matter what victory path you aim for in Civ 6, war will be a part of it.PROs:+ I like the new district mechanics, though I wish there were more (quantity and variety of effects) buildings for each district+ I like the new builder mechanics+ City states are more interesting+ Split research and civics trees is more good than bad+ Better than Civ 5 was pre-expansionsCONs:- Religion is painful- No diplomatic victory option. It was janky in Civ 5, but it enabled some gameplay options that are missing from this game (like focusing on economy with mostly peaceful intentions).- The AI is as bad as all the reviews say- The start location scripting/city placement issues are as bad as the reviews say (I once had another civ spawn in the hex next to mine, I captured his settler with my warrior on turn one)- I appreciate what the devs attempted to do with the AI agendas to give them some diversity, but it turned the AI civs into loose cannons. With almost non-existant diplomacy, it's a bad combo.- Large maps and the higher difficulty settings just aren't fun.- No penalties for building wide, no benefit to building tall- No VeniceWait for post-expansion reviews or pick up when on sale."
28,232.3,Not Recommended," July 13, 2017",976,"As a lover of Civ 5, it pains me to say that Civ 6 fundamentally fails as a strategy game. The crucial problem of this game is that the vast majority of decisions made by the player ultimately don't matter, and the decisions that do matter will have the same right answer time and time again. In a nutshell, Civ 6 is shallow and repetitive. It doesn't work.War is always the right answer. The fastest way to a cultural victory is to steal the hard work of a cultural player. The fastest way to science victory is to take over other Civs for their science output. War is also the best way to spread your religion. So by pursuing the domination victory, you inevitably end up doing what is optimal for all other victory types as well. Hence, war is always the right answer and the game is broken.Diplomacy is broken. It's broken to the point of comedy. For example, Frederick gets mad if you get friendly or become Suzerain of city states. Now heres the question: Is it ever within the players advantage to choose to not become friendly with city states so as to avoid angering Frederick? No, of course not. So what ends up happening is that Frederick will hate you every single game. And what's comical is that every character's agenda is similarly broken and ends up having the same effect as Fredericks. It's inevitable that every AI character will hate you just for playing the game properly. Not to mention that war is always the right answer and war mongering penalty is steep, so it's best to just ignore diplomacy entirely- it's so irrelevant that it's not worth the brain space of thinking about it.The characters are severely unbalanced. Scythia and Sumeria are unstoppable. Germany is also well above the rest of the cast because of its high production output. It's like they never play tested the game. The special abilities of most of the cast don't matter because they are designed for a Civ game when Civ 6 is a game of war.The Eureka boosts add to the games repetitiveness. The effect they have is that you end up doing the same actions in the same order over and over again. This reduces the extent to which decisions are made in response to what is going on in the environment. The effect is disastrous in what is already a repetitive game.The user interface is awful. The game interrupts itself constantly with the same annoying cut scenes. Skipping through them is too slow and they get old fast. Again, it's clear that this game wasn't adequately play tested.This game is also glitchy. It's gotten better since release, but it's still far from a polished product.If another player wins the game, it skips immediately to the ""defeat"" cutscene. It jumps to this cutscene so fast that you don't know who won or by what victory type. This can happen seemingly out of nowhere if the AI gets a non-domination victory (usually a religious victory, I have never seen an AI get anything but a religious victory. It is by far the easiest victory type for the AI against the player- just to mention another thing that is broken). It's extremely frustrating to put many hours into a game only to have it end abruptly. In order to figure out how you lost, you have to select the ""just one more turn"" option and then do detective work. It's just awful. There's no way this game was play tested.Ultimately, Civ 6 is game that comes off as lazy and rushed. I gave it many chances and tried my best to appreciate it, but the flaws are too severe. I typically find myself getting bored by turn 20. The repetitiveness is maddening."
184,129.2,Not Recommended," September 3, 2017",298,"Although it pains me to do this, I have to give Civilization 6 a thumbs down.It's just not fun. After a few games of this I just went back to playing V.I'll try to list everything I find positive about the game over V:Instead of passively impressing every city state just for existing, you now have a new system that encourages you to influence your favorites.Religion now matters, as a Victory.Vastly different Civilization abilities almost make each game feel unique.Much easier moddability.Sean ""I am Fond of Pigs"" Bean's narration is fantastic, it is one of the few things that never gets old about this game.Now the, unfortunately, longer list of Cons. Especially downgrades from V:A real shame, I was very excited about Civ 6. I kept looking online every day to see which Civ would be included, wondering who would show up next. Over the past year I've played a few games, but kept feeling something was missing.Civilization 6 is just not fun, and that's tragic. Hopefully a future patch can change this sad game into something great."
105,166.2,Not Recommended," November 10, 2017",644,"There is so much to love about CIV VI. The new multi-hex city development is fantastic, a vast improvement on the old ‘single hex’ city. You now have to plan, and think ahead as to how you will develop your city. The way builders now work, while feeling odd at first, now makes sense. Again, a huge improvement.But, and I am afraid it is a big but. Diplomacy. Not only is it childish on occasions, as to why a CIV declares war on you, it blatantly lies to you. Then you get the ‘Diplomacy Spam’. Politely refuse to allow a CIV into your capitol, and they will come back almost every three or four turns and keep asking you. Not annoying and doesn’t break immersion? Try creating a custom single player game with the max allowed A.I. CIVs. It’s verging on unplayable. The full screen displomacy uses, adds to this frustration.Then we have that old chestnut Religion. It’s just not worth the effort to create one. Your cities will get swamped relentlessly, as A.I. CIVs constantly swamp your land in order to convert your cities.CIV VI has the potential to be the greatest CIV game ever. But right now, it’s a long way off and a missed opportunity.As I have to either recommend it or not, I cannot in all honesty fully recommend it. In reality, its somewhere in between the two.EDITOne thing I forgot to mention. The initial civ starting positions. It’s ludicrous. You can have a huge size map but the civs will all be right close in to you. Huge swathes of land will be completely empty. There is no space.Edit 2Religion has indeed improved. That has to be said."
109,52.3,Not Recommended, March 7,228,"Civ 6 is probably the best Civ game I've played in a long time. The new research system with inspirations granted from doing various tasks is a fantastic idea that should have been in the game a long time ago. The neutral cities giving quests that allow you to curry favour with them, and the resulting benefits, also makes that portion of the game much more worthwhile. Workers having limited charges makes them much more sensible, and with some mods, making them automated helps greatly in the late game.So why the negative review?Three (four?) words.The. AI. SUCKS.You don't notice this early on, because you're too busy being amazed by all of the things they do right. But eventually, once the glamour wears off, it smacks you in the face. You realise that the AI literally can't do anything right.First it's the small things - like, when you're attacking a city, if the city has a unit fortified in it, it won't attack your attackers unless it has other units in the nearby attacking range. Even if the unit is ranged, it will just sit inside and wait, until another one shows up, before attacking.Eventually, though, you start noticing that the AI doesn't actually even play the game. It just sits there and waits for you to react. It never attacks you, unless you're grossly under-defended. And when it attacks, it's painfully easy to wipe the attackers out.Where it really kicks you in the nuts, though, is when you start playing on Emperor difficulty or greater. Read some of the guides online, and you'll realise that the harder difficulties don't actually make the AI better - it just lets the AI cheat. And the way to beat the AI on these harder difficulties, is to basically abuse mechanics as much as possible.Hopefully they eventually fix the AI, because the game really is great. And if you're playing for multiplayer (which I'm not), it quite possibly could already be great. But for now, I have to give this a negative review."

74,26.3,Not Recommended, February 12,1,"OK, Steam asks me for a review (after I got a ""free weekend play"" offer, managed to squeeze 20 hours)...I am an old guy (40+ yo), played Civs since Civ1, spent my teen years playing Civ2 (and 3), didn't like Civ4 much, spent over 2800 hours on Civ5 and still going (still 3 civilizations to play-and-win).I will write this review for all Civ5 fans out there, thinking the almighty ""Is it worth it yet?"" question.It's not. At least not yet.What did I like:- refreshed government types (early goverment types unlock very few benefits, later ones more and more) - think ""they replaced Policies with it""),- interesting City District mechanics (still didn't fully wrap my head around it, but I only played 20h or so), making Cities physically large, occupying 10+ hexes),- trade routes now establish roads automatically (oh, and wokers now ""expire"" after few uses so you only use them to build farms/mines/etc but not roads),- Corps/Fleet idea (you can join 2-3 units of same type to create a stronger version with bigger punch; useful if you're hopelessly outgunned by tech-superior opponent, your swordsmen against his riflemen).What I didn't like:- cartoonish graphics (I realize developers want to introduce 12yo's to this game, but they clearly forgot about veteran gamers), especially irritating on diplomacy screens, I don't think I will ever get used to it,- seems it's made for tablets, not PCs (aforementioned graphics, everything is click-click-click - not much of keyboard control),- reports are clunky compared to Civ5 (try to list all your military units, to see if they need upgrading etc, I dare you; try to easily see which of your cities has most production/science/...),- diplomacy is a joke; while I like Cassus Belli (a ""reason"" to start a war to minimize your warmongering score) it's only the player needs it, AI will be constantly starting wars with you, even if moment ago they were showing smily face (icon representing your standing with them), and then when you pummel them to dust (hey, they started!) all other AIs will start hating you for warmongering,- oh, and they will be denouncing you every 5 turns or so, and that's the video sequence you have to wait through (and THEN click ""OK, done""), making turns longer and longer (the ""denounce"" is used by players to start wars; it's not really used by AI for nothing else)- not to mention that scary Gilgamesh looks like a Asterix-or-Obelix cartoon. He was my friend for ages, and then he hated me, and then my ""free weekend"" expired to I couldn't put him to his Disney-like grave.What is interesting but needs improving:- the Eureka system. Great idea (""if you use archers all the time for war, it should be much easier for you to develop crossbows""), but flawed execution. Some Eurekas are triggered by luck (""find a natural wonder to speed up research on X""), some by something-way-too-easy (""build a Niter mine to speed up research on Rifling, 3 or 4 eras (!) ahead of you""), and some are just insane (""build 3 units of this brand new thing to speed up following research"", where research takes 30 turns, and building that brand new unit takes 25 turns),- new World Wonders; some are overpowered (Big Ben!), some are useless (""Chicken"" Itza it's now just that, it just improves jungle tiles in this single city alone and takes 80+ turns to build, WTF?).I know DLCs change the game. I will still wait and read reviews once every while to see if anything changed. But for now...Verdict: do not buy (yet?), stick to Civ5."
28,379.6,Not Recommended," October 2, 2017",512,"I’ve played way to much civilization, and my first impression of this new civilization game was not a good one. I was comparing it to all the previous games and not just looking at it as a standalone game.After many hours of play, without the comparison to other versions, I still can't decide If would recommend this game to others.Some Pros: The districts concept create a fun new way to think about cities and I enjoy being able to see each individual building in the district it belongs to. One note I do have is that in old civ games I felt a more tangible reward from buildings, and in many cases, the most tangible reward in this civilization is the little graphic fun building you get to see. Which is no comparison. I’d rather know the specific benefit of that building and have it be worthwhile then get a cute building graphic and have a vague understanding of what that building is doing. As I’ve played the game I’ve jotted down specific things that I believe may be holding Civ 6 back from being as satisfying as the other games. These random notes are below. I apologize in advance.I should also note that I have not purchased any expansion other than the Aztecs. This is so because of all the flaws in the game. The usual gameplay overhauling expansion is what I want. Not a map or a new civ with a new wonder.Unequal distribution of turn worth. 18 turns for spy mission yielding 4000 gold when my civilization makes over 1000 gold per turn.Spies have 3 promotion levels with benefits, then they claim to have more as they complete missions BUT there is no option to pick another upgrade and the actual level and effectiveness of the spy doesn’t seem to change at all.Lies about spy promotionsSpy cannot see the cities current production.The “victory progress” world rankings gives inadequate explanation to why science victory progress bar is slowly increasing in stage 3. Also spies are unable to gather relevant information too"

The AI is still too stupid to make games playable. Every interaction with opponents is fraught with basic UI errors.

89,112.8,Not Recommended," September 21, 2017",875,"A direct downgrade from Civ V with a predatory DLC policy and inability to reliably use workshop content.The GoodCiv VI's district system is, in my opinion, a great innovation in city management, as it means that one city can't produce everything for the empire. The fact that wonders now take up a tile slot adds to this, and the result is that turtling isn't as effective a strategy anymore and one city can't house literally 90% of the world's wonders. District management means planning is paramount.The BadThis game launched with few leaders, some of whom were near reskins of existing ones. Firaxis has decided that it's okay to ship the same civ with a different leader, which only changes one of the unique characteristics of a civ, and call that differentiation. The game is also unbalanced. If you don't have DLC, you will always square off against either Sumeria or Scythia in the late-game, because they are extremely powerful civs. If you have DLC, you will face whatever civ is a DLC civ.Each game feels hardly different than any other because the civ variety is so low. Each game feels like you're fighting the same seven enemies with the same two always coming out on top.Civ VI employs a predatory system of DLC release. DLC civs are objectively more powerful than base-civs, making Civ VI essentially pay-to-win. A will cost you $5 since it comes bundled with a bunch of useless crap like scenario packs that you'll never play. FURTHERMORE, and this deserves its own paragraph:----------You'll notice that my profile has ~99 hours of gameplay in Civ VI. At least 5 of that is just bug fixing. Here is a list of bugs I have had that is in no way complete, but what I can remember off my head:* Crashing from launch screen* Build/Culture/Bottom-Right button not working at all* Units not moving to the space I click on* Almost every single patch to this game will require you to not only disable, but UNINSTALL FROM THE FILE FOLDER every single piece of Workshop DLC content you have ever downloaded, and chances are you still won't be able to use DLC content even with a reinstallation.* Unit icons not displayingAnd lastly, the single most ugly thing about this entire game, worse even than the frequent crashes, predatory DLC policy, and inability to use Workshop content:Every single time you complete a production, you need to do another. It's incredibly micro-intensive. ""But wait!"" I hear you say, ""I can just get a UI mod from the Workshop to fix that!"" To which I say, no, you can't. Civ VI won't run Workshop content without breaking instantly.Go buy Civ V.Edit: To those that are saying Endless Legend started the district system, they didn't-- at least not as it's used here. Endless Legend's districts allow the city to utilize all benefits of extra tiles or adjacencies. There is nothing preventing you from building any building you want in any city in EL. Civ's district system is innovative because it prohibits building certain buildings without the prerequisite district."
219,106.2,Not Recommended," February 27, 2017",436,"TL;DR: At the current state I cannot recommend this game. Not until the issues with the AI mechanics have been truly addressed.Civilization is one of my absolute favorite game brands so I was naturally really excited about the Civilization VI and also preordered the game. The reason for my late review is that my laptop unfortunately broke fairly soon after the release and I was without a PC until only very recently.After around a hundred hours I've now reached the conclusion that this game has a few core issues in how the AI acts that make it extremely frustrating and hard for even the most open-minded player to fully enjoy the game. I've tried my very best to overcome the downsides for the sake of the many upsides and enjoy the game. However in the end I just can't overcome the main downside of the game. The graphical design is fantastic and the game packs with many welcomed ideas or enhancements like the districts and new wonder placement, day-night cycle, new city state mechanics and the beautiful drawn map.A major thing the Civilization V was lacking was a proper diplomacy and that's what Firaxis wanted to upgrade in the 6th installment of the series. The ending result was the idea being great but the implementation not that much. In this review I will focus on those few major points that keep me from recommending this game despite how much I love it otherwise.The AI constantly denounces you for unrealistic reasons. A few of them being: ""your military is too weak"", ""you have so much that I do not"" (having one other luxury resource that the AI doesn't), ""you have accuired more great people than I have"", ""you have a different coverment policy than I have"" or ""you haven't spread your religion to my city yet"". It's absolutely frustrating when you try your best to be friendly with the AI but the relationship either starts right off negative or ends up going there very swiftly. In short the AI most of the time thinks and acts like a very close-minded pessimist.The other negative aspect of the game goes hand-in-hand with the issue I mentioned above. All the AI Civilizations are more or less warmongers that seek any possibility to declare war on you. My ""best"" experience was when in a very early game (below turn 50) I met an AI and they immediately declared war on me. This was followed by every other AI in the game (3) declaring war on me one by one during the next couple of turns. Half of these AI's I had not even met yet. What makes the situation more absurd is that every time when you counter the attack of an AI who has declared war on you, the other AI's denounce YOU as a warmonger. ""The world shall know truth about you"". How does that make sense?The recent Australia update supposedly came with minor adjustments and tuning for the AI as well but I honestly can't see much of an improvement. The core issues are still there. Instead of pushing out new DLC for the game I'd hope that Firaxis would patch the base game so it wouldn't feel so unfinished. It is no coincidence that this game has gotten really mixed reviews so far and as a new buyer I would hold my purchase for now. I will gladly change my rating later on when the issues with the AI mechanics have been addressed properly. I love Civilization and it greatly saddens me to give this game a negative review even if it wasn't my final opinion."
323,76.3,Not Recommended," May 10, 2017",607,"Imagine a situation - You have 4 cities, the other player has 3. Will you get really upset with him and want to destroy him? Here's another situation. You have 20 ships, other player has 18 ships. Will you nuke him for this reason? If you find my questions puzzling and confusing its because the AI in this game is puzzling and confusing.You start the game, meet the Romans, its the year -4000. Boom, they'll condemn you for not having alot of cities while you both just founded your first. Have less ships then Norway? You'll never be their allies. Have 1 more wonder then the Chinese? They'll hate you forever. The AI in this game is so annoyingly childish that you'll end up most games wanting to destroy everyone. While this isn't new with Civilization, the literal idiocracy of the existing AI is some of the worse ive seen in a strategy game."
150,125.9,Recommended," December 18, 2017",397,"I love this game, but would I buy it full price? No...I have been playing Civ since the original back in the 90s, and over the years its changed dramatically. Yet even inspite loving this game there are a few things i find really disapointing. But first the stuff I love.........1: Two Tech TreesYea you read that correct, instead of having the old standard tech tree there is a second one that covers your civic abilities. These in hand effect how you govern or opens up more to how you can govern better to your preferred style. For instance one of my favourite abilities from Civ4 'Serfdom' has reappeared and the way this ability works is pretty great.2: Still Fight Barbariansin previous games when you reach a certain age or a unit reaches a certain experience I have found that those units no longer gain experience when fighting barbarians, thats now changed. you can still level a unit but unfortunatly its at a very slower rate than if your up against a civilization target. Yet still its good that when you come up against mauraders trying to pillage your sea tiles that you can be rewarded.3: DistrictsAt first I wasn't sure if I liked the idea of districts or not but I think the more I play the more I like. The idea behind districts is that your cities are not just on one tile but can spread out over several tiles. This in my opinion can be a blessing or a curse. It can be a blessing if you find the right spot to build a city and there are plenty of boosters for your districts like Mountains or rainforests for science districts. The curse comes more with the lack of space issue. Especially if you land in a location and raise a city only because you find valuable resources, but the city could fail to see its potential due to a lack of district space. The game forces you to make more wiser decisions.Those are the main likes, here are my main dislikes.....1: All roads lead to Rome?Err no they don't, the way you build roads has been redeveloped for some bizare reason and they no longer have the abilities of earlier Civ games. First of all your builders no longer create roads, only traders and a new engineer unit can build roads. If you task a trader to trade with another one of your cities it creates a road on its path. If you use an engineer, the unit only lasts for 2 active turns and then disappears, they seem to be a waste of time imo............ Roads no longer give you any advantage anymore, they don't provide added tile wealth like in previous games, and they don't really offer any movement advance for units, e.g. 3 tiles instead of one, in fact I have seen units avoid roads for some reason.2: Oh and the same for buildersThats right, with no modifications your builders only have three active turns, meaning that you can only get them to develop three tiles. So for example in previous games if you wanted to say redevelop a pasture hill with rainforest to build a mine, it might take e,g, 10 turns to do everything from cut down the rainforest and then build the mine, now it take 2 of your 3 goes, one to cut down the trees one to build mine. The only saving grace is that every action is instant, cutting trees take one turn, building a mine is one turn etc etc. I am not entirely sure why the devs have done this, and especially why they have changed the way roads are built and work. my only conclusion is to reduce map congestion, but that should be left to the player to decide. I used to love having a transport ship filled with builders who follow and invasion in case I have used nukes or if I need to redevelop the infastructure. Can't really do that now.3: Boot polish can make it shineWell I think in this case there is a distint lack of polish and especially when the game costs £50 - £70 depending on what version you get before any discount is alarming. There are a lot of bugs in this game and things missing that I would expect from previous games from the get go. One bug is when a Civ tries to contact you but then does nothing, the animation is still playing for the civ leader but no pop ups, Why does this happen? Well I have worked out that parts of the game work to quickly, and when the game is catching up the game crashes. This is not a PC speed issue as it would happen all the time otherwise. Another bug which I have experienced and it seems reading the reviews for the game so have others, other leaders are easy to♥♥♥♥♥♥off. For instance if you build a wonder or choose a different form of government, other world leaders seem to go into a nerd rage.Also why do the devs still insist on not having transport ships and forcing one unit per tile, its so redundant and slow, also where are my paratroopers? I love paras as they offer a great dynamic to combat.4: A lack of consequenceOne of the things I loved about Civ4 (imo my favourite version I think) was that every important game changing task you did had concequences. For example, you got caught spying big time, it had consequences, you have developed Nukes, it had concequences. Now nothing does. I had caught a civ trying to steal cash and sabotage districts, and in spite the fact they apologised, they did it again several turn later. I declared war which seemed the only way to stop them, but I turned out to be the bad guy for doing this and ruined the end game because everyone hated me and called me a warmounger. Put this down to a bug or intentional, either way it ruined my game.5: Out pricing the futureYep as it seems with all games these days the polish comes in the form of overpriced DLCs. At £25 I think I will wait for the sales before I purchase ""Rise and Fall"".It seems that I actually hate this game considering that I put more negatives but I don't, I struggle to hate any Civ game even when newer versions remove the stuff I really loved. I just think that when you make a conscious decision to buy the game you do it knowing the negative points. There is still enough love in this game to make it enjoyable but thats where you as the player come into it."
70,125.1,Not Recommended," December 1, 2016",1,"TLDR - Interesting choices with city building, good graphics. But AI and diplomacy is broken.I like the city districts and the strategic possibilities it entails. But it feels like they spent all their time on that mechanic.Imagine being invited by a nation to help them fight a war, and then get denounced by the SAME country as a warmonger for your troubles. Imagine getting suprised attacked by a nation, defending yourself and taking one of that nation's cities in retaliation and being denounced as a warmonger by that nation and everyone else. Imagine liberating a nation long-dead for millennia, no acknowledgment of thanks, and then being denounced by the same liberated nation as a warmonger. Welcome to Civ VI, where you are hated no matter what you do. And no matter what victory condition you start with, you always end up wanting to nuke the &*$@#^& out of the nations around you. For the first time in all the Civ games I've played I wished there was an option to execute opposing leaders, that's how annoyed I got. Ah to see the eternally annoying Phillip II lose his head, now THAT would be fun...Wait there's more! Imagine being asked for a gift of resources, plus gold, plus gold per turn. You think to yourself, ""I feel generous today"" and offer at least the resources and the one-time gold, but not the gold per turn. Well, these entitled♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥will tell you, ""Not good enough! We want a gift from you the way WE say it."" It's unreal. So back to nuking them. Honestly I cannot understand the thinking that went into the diplomacy, it's the worst I've ever seen. It doesn't just feel unfinished, it's plain bad. As usual your opponents get to say snarky comments and threaten and bully you and you get no options to respond. This has been an issue for me in previous games too, but it's even more exquistely painful in Civ VI.And the AI does ridiculous things like FLOOD your country with their missionaries and apostles, blocking your path and there's no option to even say, ""Hey, can you relax with the religion thing?"" I had to declare war multiple times just so I could move around my own empire. And of course, the flood of hate and denouncing hits you from all sides. I played king level and at the end of the game city states still had warriors and even some nations.This game needed way more playtesting. I hope like other Civ games it improves with patches, but I'm not pre-ordering a Civ game ever again."
156,127.6,Not Recommended," June 1, 2017",892,"I don't usually write reviews, but I was so, so disappointed with Civ VI and 8 months on, nothing has changed that feeling. I'd say that as of now, if anyone is thinking of buying the game, just get Civ V for a fraction of the price and wait for some actually interesting DLC to be released for Civ VI, or maybe a really big sale. Full price is a joke right now...I played 380 hours of Civ V, and I loved it. I pre-ordered Civ VI as soon as it was announced. Whoops.While a couple (and no more than just a couple) of features were exciting and fun (such as the city districts), the majority of the game felt so, so similar to Civ V. My impressions were that it was essentially a nice mod for Civ V. No where near worth $60. I'm hoping some DLC will invigorate the game and change it up, but 8 months later and they've only released $25 of civilization/scenario packs. Which is also insulting, as these civilizations add nothing new to the game.On top of only feeling like a modded Civ V, they didn't fix any of the major issues of Civ V - mainly, the crappy AI. If anything, they've made it worse by adding more reasons for the AI to randomly hate you. I've found that once a rival civilization hates you (which can start very early and for very little reason), it's just going to be all-out war for the rest of the game, with a few turns of peace scattered throughout. There's no respite. Not that you necessarily need it, as the AI is also stupid and incapable of conducting a proper war or assault. And then you get warmonger penalties, and so everyone else hates you as well. It takes the whole element of diplomacy out of the game.There are just so many cons to Civ VI, and only a couple of pros. The changes from Civ V are mostly aesthetic, which should never cost $60. I'm really hoping there'll be some REAL DLC coming soon to breathe some life back into the game. I'll never pre-order a Firaxis game again."
96,185.8,Not Recommended," June 4, 2017",472,"I love the Civilization series. I've grown up playing the series since Civ II, when I was only eight years old. This series has shaped what I know and expect out of any strategy game, and will forever serve as a litmus test to other strategy series. I can play any number of games and genres, but I always go back to Civilization when I grow bored of the others. Keeping this in mind, Civ 6 has been a huge disappointment to me and fails to compare to its predecessors in any way.Many new features are welcome improvements (though admitedly adapted from other comparable series): the introduction of districts, policies, and changes to various science, espionage, religious, and military aspects. I even warmed up to the art style very quickly in my first playthrough. They carried over enough of the previous games to make it easy for me to pick up and start playing right away. Unfortunately, they left behind the soul of the previous entries.Civ, for me, has always been a single-player game first, making interaction with the AI one of the most important features in the game. I like how they made the AI react differently to my playstyle. I like that I can have reasons (casus belli) to declare war, drastically reducing warmonger penalties to the AI. Unfortunately, all of this means nothing since the AI is deperately broken. They will declare wars against you and other civs for absolutley no reason, and then beg you for peace, giving you all of their resource. City states will either be technologically inept in the later game, or wildly advanced beyond any civ close to them. Harder difficulties don't make the AI play any better - they just get more settlers and builders to start. It took them six months just to patch the AI to make it playable, but it still needs improvement.To make matters worse, Firaxis is taking the Paradox route by nickel and diming fans just to get the ""bonus"" content of new civilizations, which are honestly desperately needed for the enjoyment of replayablility. As of this review, they are charging a minimum of $5 new civilization. I felt that Civ 4 and 5's expansions were perfect - these expansions brought multiple new civs, leaders, and game changing content, all for the better. Yes, they were more expensive, but they brought so much that they were worth it. Until sweeping changes come from expansions or patches, I do not recommend purchasing the game at full price in its current state."
134,36.3,Not Recommended," January 15, 2017",540,"Civilization 6 is a good game, but not if you compare it to Civilization 5, which is just a much better game. Civ 6 does some things better than Civ 5, like for example the district system, the finished wonder animations, culture, great people, espionage and trade routes. Some things that I liked in Civ 5 are worse in civ 6, like statistics, map, A.I, resources and religion.One thing that might be insignificant to you is the map showing owned water tiles as if they were land tiles. To me that is just a fun killer since I love looking at the map to see the empire I have created. In this system it just looks like a blob instead of an empire.The A.I in Civilization 6 is pure garbage. In one game I played I had declared war ONCE in the entire game. One time in 354 turns (1932 A.D) and every single A.I denounced me for being a warmonger when I did it on like turn 100, and renewed their warmonger denouncements continualy through the rest of the game, despite me not starting a single war since then. I think this is why the A.I for some reason counts wars declared against you as you being a warmonger, which is just beyond stupid.- The A.I is also incapable of fighting human players. All I did to win every single war was to just sit there and do nothing until the A.I gave up. They send like one or two units into my land and that's it. I play on immortal difficulty.- The A.I mocked me by saying my economy was weak and that I would go bankrupt soon...I had the strongest economy in the game.- Diplomacy...I might be overly harsh on this game, but that is only because I have like 2.000 hours on Civ 5, and I'm making a lot of comparisons between Civ 6 and Civ 5. It seems like they're doing the same ""mistake"" they did with Civ 5, where the game was fixed through multiple expensive DLC's.At Civilization 6's current state, I will say you're better off just buying Civilization 5 if you don't have that.This is a subjective review, so treat it as such."
153,85.9,Not Recommended," April 5, 2017",817,"I am very happy to have written this review because it helped me figure out what was very wrong with this game.TL;DR: This is RECOMMANDED for NEW CIV PLAYERS, who have not experienced the series yet and will probably have a ton of fun discovering the ""complex"" mechanics of a 4X game. Though I'd say Civ 4 and 5 are probably a ton of fun as well.For ""veterans"", this is a glorious NO. Not because of AI/Diplomacy, which have been rightly criticized; rather because of stupid mechanics. One word: tedious.What works- city building and planning (districts <3)- the added culture tree- government cards could be refined but the idea isn't too bad- builders charges- AI- diplomacy and agendas (omg wtf it's awful)- religion (100% not worth the investment)- stupid mechanics: where is the fun?(for me at least)My analysis is this: the game has very tedious-to-optimize mechanics alongside a general lack of challenge. This awesome ""combo"" makes you feel like you're without the sense of that comes from overcoming difficult odds.Two examples below:Upon realizing specific actions (eg. building three archers), you get a massive reduction in a specific tech cost (50% or 40% of the tech). This is available for every science and culture tech in the game.The way the feature was introduced by Firaxis, it seemed that it would allow for civs to go faster upon certain tech routes (for example, sea-related techs for the Vikings) thus making every game different depending on what happens in your game, where you start, who you encounter... I would call it an ""organic evolution"" of your civ depending on the context you're in. Sounds good! Sounds like a ton of replayability!Now let's look at this from the ""optimizer"" perspective, that is, players who cannot play a game without trying to exploit every mechanic in the best way possible (that would be me). Of we are going to try to get every eureka and inspiration: it's A 50% REDUCTION IN TECH COST, FOR DUCK'S SAKE!! EVEN THE BEST BUILDINGS DON'T DOUBLE SCIENCE YIELDS. But getting these eurekas/inspirations is tedious (each one has a very specific trigger). So you go along the tech tree, researching 50% of every tech BUT NO MORE because you don't wait to forfeit your 50% reduction. You just switch techs everytime you reach 50%.This is not fun. This is the opposite of fun. I'm certain this is not the way Firaxis intended this mechanic to be used in.There are hidden formulas within the game (WHY hide this information from me?). As an example, : if you got 50 tech, the district cost will be much higher than when you had researched 13 techs. In and of itself, it doesn't sound too good already, does it?BUT THERE'S A TWIST: if you place your district on the map (by launching production), it locks the cost! So, the Optimizer will place every district as early as possible, then immediately switch production to more sensible things (like military units), just in order to avoid the cost increasing with tech. STUPID STUPID STUPID mechanic.It also makes founding new cities completely not worth it past a certain amount of turn (because local production will never be able to afford building the increased-cost districts).I know it's easy to talk trash on a game that I've spent 80 hours on and end up not recommending. So, here are my two cents on how to make the game better.1) get rid of the eurekas and inspirations OR make the requirements harder to attain so that you aren't tempted to go after all the bonus2) improve military AI so as to make the AI an actual danger3) improve diplomacy so that the AI understands it is playing a game that they want to WIN. With this mindset, allying the player can be very beneficial if it helps overcoming a stronger opponent or eating part of their empire.Currently, every civ will hate your gut for conquering that tiny Roman 2-pop city after Trajan declared war ON YOU. From that moment on, don't ever hope to ally anyone, because you're a badass WARMONGER in the eyes of the whole world. Let that sink in for a minute.4) get rid of the ""agendas"", open or hidden. It's stupid. The AI shouldn't hate you or love you depending on set-in-stone conditions related to (a)historical facts, rather they should assess the situation they are in and how allying or warring you makes them come closer to their own victory5) rebalance the whole game: religion, tourism can safely be ignored 100% of the time. Military, maybe science are the only viable options. Civs are also wildly unbalanced.6) Religious combat isn't right. Missionaries have always been tedious to manage. Why make it a unit? Rather, let us manage religion through a dedicated screen, that would allow us to specify what city we want to target. No more going around the map, that's tedious.7) Have a sensible formula for district cost8) Don't hide formulas from the playerThank you for your time.Your hateful comments will be disbanded. I don't care about your ""freedom of speech"", I do care about my feelings.Fair criticism is always welcome, I love being proven wrong (I absolutely mean it, no sarcasm)."

Really, this game isn't worth your time... Get Civ V instead - it's a far superior game...My key issues are as follows:1) The AI repeatedly declares war, sends nothing to attack you, then begs for peace some turns later prostrating themselves before you with offerings of gold and luxuries.2) When at war with the AI, they never attack. I remember playing Civ IV, and seeing armies building up on my border before the AI declares war. No behaviour of that sort is to be seen here.3) The AI is schizophrenic and utterly moronic. They will condemn you for warmongering, while frequently attempting to encourage you to join in their wars. Involving yourself in even a single war during an otherwise peaceful playthrough can lead to unanimous loathing from the AI, with constant denouncements being shouted at you.4) The AI never uses aircraft...5) The AI settles cities in any location they can, and leaves them completely undefended. The AI does not choose efficient locations for city building, and thus irritates that player into having to declare war in order to raze the cities and more efficiently use the land.6) The victory screen statistics are total garbage. There is no map replay.7) The UI feels a bit awkward, with various essential tools seemingly overlooked. There is, for example, no list of all units. If you want to find your builders, you must do this manually by scrolling over your empire. A further oversight is the lack of a global politics overview. If you want to know who is at war with whom, you must ""speak"" to each leader in turn, and look at their current relationships.Complaints aside, however, I have to say that this game is looks stunning - it is rich in detail and vivid in colour, and the wonder animations are an absolute delight. The sound design is fantastic, and music is memorable and quite beautiful. The new district system is absolute genius - making the process of building and laying out a city a substantially more interesting and nuanced process compared to Civ V. It's a terrible shame that the AI is just such garbage - it ruins the game. I used to play ""comp stomps"" with my friends on a fairly regular basis, but doing so in Civ VI would be a waste of time.Edit:Some people have suggested that I play the game on harder difficulties, but my understanding is that higher difficulty levels simply add a multiplier to the AI's output (e.g. they get a 2x production multiplier so that they can always outproduce you), and does not affect their behaviour. Since my biggest problem with the game is its broken AI, playing on harder difficulties simply gives them an advantage, but does not make them ""smarter"".Additionally, I think it's valid to compare the game to Civ V. I played Civ V from its initial 'vanilla' release, and (I realise that I'm referencing personal memories from ~6 years ago) do not recall being as disappointed with the AI after making the jump from the mature game of Civ IV to the then new game of Civ V. Therefore, I stand by my statement that Civ V is a better game. It is not more content that I desire, but a challenging, inteligent AI."

But recommending this game would mean supporting Firaxis' bad practice of releasing a broken, partial game.Why broken/partial?AI is really really really bad. I mean civ 1 AI was much better than this. I could just as well play with no AI enemies and it would be the same (maybe less annoying).End-game management of cities is much worth than previous versions. I like that there is no cap on the amount of colonies (except for luxury resources providing bonus to only 4 each). But come on, do I really need to tell every city to build ""Market project"" (ie convert production to gold) every 2-3 turns? Can't I just tell them to keep on building this??? Is implementing a production queue that hard to do? I mean you've done it in civ 5, why not in 6?So really, the game is great, I had lots of fun playing it, but Firaxis, I expected more out of you.

159,243.9,Not Recommended," November 6, 2016",1,"Civ 6 had me hooked and playing late into the night for 80+ hours on ""King"" Difficulty for the past few weeks. So its doing something right at least. However even with all its greatness I have to not recommend it at this time. Civ 6 has a few issues that are infuriating to the point I did not want to play the game anymore even when I felt the ""One more turn"" urge to keep playing.First the changes that made me love Civ 6;-Art style: I actually like the style, especially the map fog which I assume everyone likes.-Barbarians: Holy jebus they can actually be a challange to deal with. Even late game when you least expect it.-Districts/Wonder Placement: Actually make city placement and specialization more thought provoking and fun.-Tech/Culture Eureka/Inspiration: Another good feature that can effect your gameplay style of a game.-Great Persons: if you want em you gotta go after them vigorously. And they range from ""Oh neat"" to ""HOLY♥♥♥♥♥♥THATS AWESOME""-Various other things but here comes the long rant...Now the things that made me wonder what I was doing with my life playing Civ 6 (Mostly AI related);-UI/Infromation: So much detailed information is just GONE from Civ 5. You gotta memorize your luxurious resource trade deals because the game will not tell you how many you had in total or who you traded it to/from. You have no clue how well religion is spreading. You cannot look at Units special abilities. Combat Numbers do not accurately indicate the amount of damage your unit will deal. You have no way to look at deal historys with other civs. the ""Gossips"" tell you everything you don't need to know, from england building a granary to your civ trading with another civ the turn you setup a trade deal.-AI Agendas/Diplomacy: First off, the Agenda system is not a bad ""Idea"" its just the AI does not execute it correctly in relation to diplomacy and AI Insanity. Bottom line, if you are doing well, they will hate you, leading to all the AI denouncing eachother as well. If you manage to find ONE AI that tolerates you enough to become an Ally, they will do everything in their power to not be your friend/ally behind the scenes. Like declaring war on you for no reason.-Ai Combat Tactics/Peace terms: Speaking of declaring war, the AI are so bad at tactical combat that the Barbarians can wipe them out given the minor opportunity. They tend to fall behind in higher Tech Units because they don't upgrade their units usually. Also I think they were either programed to be complete panzies or their military command give out their orders in different languages to each unit. Because 90% of the time they will not attack anything in melee unless they can one shot it. If their HP drops to 60% that unit will run away. This leads them to just shuffle outside completly outmatched cities with a single archer able to fend off 10-15 units by himself without them even attacking the city. then the AI goes pants on head ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and decides all hope is lost and will give you EVERYTHING they own for peace.-AI General AI Batshit insanity: The AI in Civ 6 are more akin to an Alien then a human player because they act insanely random. I would say they act like Civ 5 Ghandi but at least he was predictable with his madness. ""We have been best friends for thousands of years sharing trade and tech-DECLARES WAR ON YOU"" ""Wanna do a joint war against this Warmongering prick burning down my cities? YOU ARE A WARMONGERER!"" They are such massive hypocrites like the Joint War example. EVERYTHING they ask you to stop doing, They are currently doing to you but x10, Units near borders in particular even if its a single unit 2 tiles away in your own goddamn territory while they have a massive army IN your borders.-War, War Never Changes, (Except it does for the worse): War in Civ 6 is now a huge pain in the♥♥♥♥♥because unless you declare war on people within 20 turns of the game, WARMONGERING. even the casus belli's do nothing to change this (Except Liberation wars which never happen because nobody likes you), the ""Severity"" of Warmongering penalties translate to ""How long they will hate my guts"" not ""How much they will hate my guts"" so no matter how justified your war is, everyone will denounce you for declaring war on anyone, even the people who joined the war with you. Because you are a heartless ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ marching your forces to go punch that genocidal civililization in the face, who kick puppies for fun. Next on the agenda of war is ""War Weariness"" this as a good mechanic that falls off the mark due to its execution. Because yes it makes it so you cannot just be at war forever and kill everyone. But it screws over the AI while it forces the player in the late game to keep wars in short increments or have all your cities get pissy. This screws over the defender/AI because War Weariness skyrockets in cities being fought around. probably why the AI caves and throws everything they have at you, I've sieged a city and within 2-3 turns barbarians spawned around it and it turned into a 3-way fight.-Last but not least, PACING: The games pace is so wrong, without rushing science you will have nukes by the Napoleonic Era. Epic game speed is the old standard speed. You will never stay long enough in one era to enjoy it. Finally once you hit the Atomic Era the game speed kicks into high gear rushing the game into a suddon stop. You will get the coolest tech and units 5 turns before you achieve a Science victory, possible to not even get them with a Culture victory.I've stopped playing my current game because of these problems which I desperately hope get patched or something as there is a game in here that I love. but I can't play it without feeling like I'm a cat chasing blind deaf and stupid mice to a finish line on the counter. sure there are many ways to get onto the counter and the mice ""could"" reach it. but one jumped off the counter, another♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥in my cat-bowl, the final one thought we were buddies then had a brain aneurysm and tried to bite me but had no teeth and just gnawed on meAnd before you say ""Raise the Difficulty."" thats just tying rope to the mice to pull them towards the goal faster. They are still Blind Deaf and Dumb."
80,211.2,Not Recommended, April 8,92,"A good game at it's core, probably the most complex-at-release game of the series. However, there are some serious problems regarding the AI - namely the fact that they are either petty, incredibly spontaneous, or both. The unique modifiers for each civ leader disregard capability, so the Dutch with insult and berate you for not being able to trade with them when they're on the other side of the world. They will also declare wars against you without any sort of warning, despite the display showing that they are friendly towards you. Lying civ displays was a thing back in V as well, but here it feels arbitrary and a constant frustration when your neighbors (and everyone else) suddenly declares two, four, or even six separate wars against you without any sort of real discourse. The only time a civ will demand something from you is when they are displeased with you, but know they can't win a war. The whole system makes their ""poker faces"" seem more like a game of Guess Who when the other player keeps changing their character.Map generation is oversimplified compared to Civ V, which allowed for a variety of different map types. In VI, however, you have less than ten different map types not counting the fairly minor variable modifiers. With how the Eureka and Inspiration systems work, you could easily find yourself trying to play a military civ without have any iron or horses spawning near you, resulting in a far slower tech development than those lucky enough to do so. This also happens with two of the earlier technologies, which require you to find a second continent and find a natural wonder respectively - both of which you could be easily screwed out of by no fault of your own. This leads to maps boiling down to one of a small variety. Good starts, bad starts, and unwinnable starts. Yes, those can happen - if you end up next to a horribly aggressive enemy or get cornered by barbarians, you can basically kiss your starting point goodbye, because the AI will quickly leapfrog ahead of you.On that note, Barbarians are horribly annoying in the early game, but are basically required for the Eurekas for most starting military techs. If a barbarian scout locates your city and gets back to a nearby encampment - and with a movement range of 3, that's more likely than not - you're going to find a raiding army of three units heading towards where you settled. Note that this likely happens right out of the gate, resulting in you having to put all of your development building military units so you can actually build and expand without your units being killed or abducted. The worst part, however, are barbarians that encamp near horses. Those barbarians spawn Horsemen and Horse Archers, a barbarian specific unit that is both far more mobile than their grounded counterpart but also much stronger. And you don't get the Eureka for the technology to make spearmen until you kill three barbarians total. This is even worse in slower games, because barbarians spawn much faster than you can make military units to fight them off due to the barbarian spawning not scaling to the slower game speed.Religion, which was only added later in the life cycle of Civ V, is in the base game, but it is extraordinarily tedious and frustrating. The AI will pursue religion with a crazy furvor, using every single faith point it has in the most efficient way it knows how, making competing against them to get a Religious Victory a trial of tedium. In fact, the easiest way to win a Religious victory is to actually go for a military victory. Cities burned or captured and Inquisitioned are much easier to deal with than trying to work the arcane Religious Combat system or throwing Missionaries and Apostles at any city who doesn't follow you over and over. It wasn't even until Rise & Fall was added did they allow your military units to stop religious units, who would before then just walk right through your lines and provide scouting and intelligence.Honestly, it's not a bad game. But it is disappointing, poorly balanced, and if you want to just play a fun round you may end up hitting that Restart button more than a few times. Hold off on it for a sale, at the very least."

I can tell you this- if you like your gaming companies to be competent people who don't try to sell you a million DLCs when basic functions in the game are still broken a year later then Firaxis are not your guys. If Firaxis is wondering why CIV VI is selling so poorly, maybe they should look to themselves and realize people really hate it when you sell a broken game."
95,"1,619.5",Not Recommended," September 14, 2017",242,"I've been a civ fan since civ 3 and have easily played 1000 hours for every installment. So it is with great sadness that I say this game is terrible. My hope is that the next expansion 2k/Sid Meier decide to release (and I hope much sooner than the year it took to make War of Chosen for X-Com 2 which was great) will fix alot of the issues plaguing this game.tl;dr if you look at steam stats civ 5 is being played far more than civ 6 so wait for a sale and buy that game for $10 because 6 is no where near as good.A few issues off the top of my head are:Pacing - its terrible. Eras and units are far too short and this maybe due to the eureka mechanic in the game. I like the idea of playing around these bursts of science and civics but they affect the pacing of the game so much. For instance you could finish a game in 1700AD with stealth bombers on Emperor (3rd hardest difficulty) which takes away from the immersiveness you might want.UI - The UI is terrible at the moment and mods are required to make it playable. There's no production queue, trade routes are better with the most recent patch but still awful. Diplomacy tab is just cumbersome; to see the quests required to complete to get an envoy is painful to scroll through. All cities status requires you to click through 3 tabs instead of pressing one god damn button and even then to change production queues quickly you have to zoom onto the city EVERY TIME.District removal - I love the concept of districts and playing around it. Really makes city building and perhaps going tall interesting but lack of district removal is a severe oversight. Even in the real world parcels of land get re-zoned all the time so why can't we remove districts. The only time a district might not have the right to be removed is through some grandfathered idea (like 50 turns perhaps longer). Especially due to populations limiting your ability to make new districts its crucial in strategy game to re-appropriate the land as you need it although it should be at a great expense. Adding this feature could change the game alot and how you adapt and if tied in with government it would diversify your playstyle greatly (for ex. communists governments could remove districts with fewer penalties).AI - This is probably the issue most people complain about and with good reason. AI is incredibly difficult to program especially in an intricate strategy so I can understand there will be hiccups. However, diplomacy is just a joke and often times just SPAM so much damn spam. Refusing a deal only to have the same deal pop up 3-5 turns later is infuriating; ALL SPAM IS BAD. The combat is questionable. Sometimes the AI has clear advantage and walks past your city while your at war witht hem. Their units are spaced out all over their land when it should be fighting on whatever front it should be fighting on. Barbarian spam is unreal and can overrun you so fast even if your constantly building units. The fact that barb camps can overrun you so quickly with horseman and slow down your progress so damn much can force a re-roll.This game has so much potential to be great but it pains me to say that this is the worst civ game its released in awhile. Here's hoping the developers will release an actual expansion instead of these money-gouging dlc's but for now this is straight trash and needs to be uninstalled."
536,50.0,Not Recommended," December 19, 2016",1,"The Short of It: While Civilization VI isn't a bad game, it is quite fundamentally flawed and comes in no way close to its predecessors, Civ IV and V. If you're new to the series, definitely play those instead, or if not, go for Endless Legend, why not. All three are better experiences than Civ VI.The Long of It: The Civilization series should be well-known to all gamers, but not everyone has actually played the games. The groundlayer of the turn-based 4X-genre, Civilization takes a player, and his empire, from the Stone Age to the Information Age, with the player making decisions on where to focus in terms of scientific research, military development, cultural progress, expansion, and many other factors. Every game is different, not just in terms of player-determined settings, but also in terms of map layout, rival civs, etcetera.Civ VI improves one thing greatly compared to its predecessors, and that is city development. The Districs system really forces you to think, and to specialize. Gone are the days of a single city building every improvement and Wonder. It's just not possible anymore, and that's a good thing. With the districts-system, Science and Production are no longer the be-all, end-all of games which need to be focused on primarily.Barbarians are no longer the pointless annoyances they were in the previous games. They're much deadlier now, and every civ needs to stay on its toes. This definitely gives the barbarians-element some much needed relevance.A few other nice improvements made it to Civ VI, including military/noncombatant escort formations (finally!), expendable builders (which deals with unit clutter), mix-and-match cultural policies, and Eureka!-boosts for techs and civics, earned by fulfilling all kinds of mini-tasks. Now, if they'd just stuck to that, Civ VI would have been a straight-up improvement over VI, but sadly, there's a lot to discuss when I point out...With all the desire for innovation and change, Civ VI trips over itself in quite a few departments, in same cases making the game frustrating and irritating to play.The diplomacy system is, for want of a better word, a complete disgrace. Rival Civs will all, without exception, viciously loathe each other, including you, denouncing each other and you as often as they can, even when you've done them absolutely no wrong. One Civ had several diplomacy bonuses from good relations, but still declared me filth because we had a different system of government. Meanwhile, the A.I. leaders will not stop spamming you with pointless messages every turn, and because they, for some reason, need to slowly fade out twice, it's an infuriating habit which costs you a lot of time and has no benefit at all.You might as well never bother with trade deals either. The AI will never, ever agree to a trade deal, nor suggest one, which doesn't favour them at least 3:1, even if they are pathetically weak. Their deals are nothing short of extortionate, and all they do is waste your time with more pointless interruptions, because you'd never, ever accept any of their deals anyway. As for espionage, well, expect all the A.I. opponents to focus only on you, sabotaging your Industrial Zones relentlessly, causing you to gnash your teeth as you waste yet more turns rebuilding things.What few friends you have will, guaranteed, suddenly declare war on you for no reason at all, even though they're much weaker than you are and have nothing to gain from the conflict. And then, within ten turns, they'll come begging on their knees for peace. Refuse, and the entire world will hate you even more for being a warmonger. That's right, you will be a warmongering menace to the world even if you never once declare war. Having war declared on you and defending yourself is apparently an atrocity. This kind of system makes a player wonder if this game was even playtested at all.In fact, it's not just diplomacy, really. The A.I. in general is often downright moronic.The choice of art style, as well as the writing, are questionable to say the least. While it's true that Civ V was high on realism, and therefore seriousness, Civ VI has taken to the other extreme. The art style is jarringly cartoony, with leaders looking like caricatures and the map nauseatingly green and yellow, the UI is ugly with oversaturated colours, and the educational quotes that came with tech discoveries have been replaced with cringey pseudo-witty pop culture soundbites from comedians and other assorted funny-people. Not even Sean Bean's excellent narration can save the writing from being eye-rollingly lame. All things combined, Civ VI has the look of one of those crappy mobile games.Lastly, the Civilipedia isn't much help. The game neglects to explain a lot of things and looking them up in the Civilipedia doesn't help one bit. You're supposed to smell that you can only build a single Archaelogist per city that has an archaeology museum, for instance. Often, building options will be grayed out without any explanation as to why. And don't get me started on National Parks. Ugh.And of course, once more, many civilizations and mechanics are not present, or in a bare-bones way, which means Firaxis has once more held back things which were present in the previous game, only to release them in expensive DLC packs. It's a nasty habit, and every game developer should ask itself some serious questions when it resorts to deliberately holding back game content to be able to release it as DLC later.Civ VI has some good ideas, but its positive elements don't come close to making it as good as Civ IV or Civ V. It's certainly not a bad game, but as an entry in the Civilization series, it falls far short of the standards the franchise holds itself to. Seriously, get the previous Civs instead, or if you've played those, give Endless Legend a go."
70,324.7,Not Recommended," November 9, 2017",334,"It is a bit akward to rate ""not recommended"" in to a game I played so much...So let me explain, from the view of a classic Civ player...ConsThe AI is really stupid!.... ok, there is NO civilization game who wouldn't have a stupid AI (like enemies attacking without reason even if they are much weaker and commiting suicide, AKA civ1-3) Now they are the same, plus doesn't make much sense: They will declare war or firendship even if they don't get any benefit from it at all... and wouldn't match what they feel about you. This one is so far the worst: it is impossible to have any single civilization to ally with you if you defend yourself against a random attack, or befriend you if you decide to cede all your privilieges to any rondom former firnedly civ. To put it blank: diplomacy is totally broken!Districts: I learnt to love the idea, even if you take out space to build farms, I see potential on the districts: but some of those are so underpowered that they are a waste of time! (pe the Industrial distirct gives so little production that is actually damaging to your economy)Bad pacing! I hated from earlier Civ games that ancient eras where usueless, so fast they went.... At least in pre-civ V games you'll scratch a couple of turns where one of the most amazing military units in the world became useful during ancient times: the phalanx and the legion: Civ VI manages to make those just ""meh"" and if you select ""marathon"" pacing you'll make the military exactly the same,, but you'll be discovering flight while building a district takes up to 150~ turns... Making Civ V look like an amazing game!The graphics.... I won't fall for the ""I don't like the cartoonish"" thing. I don't, but I consider the developers wouldn't be able to produce in just an acceptable amount of time some realistic 3D graphics... But then I have other questions: Wouldn't it be better to produce some high quality 2D like on Sim city4 or Simon 2 and make it accesible to slow end computers and faster in all computers? What is the point on 3D if you can't rotate anyway and it works like and old fashioned isometric engine? Well, at least the animations are quite cool....Not balanced at all: In previous games it was difficult to win unless you centered your civ to a certain task: war or science: here you have to center it around culture so any random civ won't beat you by culture even if you have all the economic and military cards on the game, or viceversa...No palace upgrades and city views! After such a downgrade in game mechanics comparing to Civ V, I was expecting some good easy gratification respect Civ IV and V! no luck :(The district mechanics is good, and I think it can really improve the game, but as it is it stands in: Buggy, faulty and meh, plus no palace and city view.... I'll stick to Civ I-III and sometimes go to V, but to enjoy VI you'll need mods... if you want to buy it I'll recommend to check the mods regularly and decide if it is worth. as a standlone product it is a big step backwards!"
50,236.5,Not Recommended," October 25, 2016",1,"Civ VI has all the promises of being great, but is being held back by what I can only assume is lack of development time.I've enjoyed the game so far and I'm certain I'll keep playing it for awhile, but after some 60 hours the novelty is wearing off and the flaws that I initially wrote off as rare quirks can now be seen clearly as major problems.There are minor bugs all over, most of them more annoying than gamebreaking but they are very clearly things that should have been on a ""to-fix"" list after in-house playtesting, yet they're present in the released game. I've had very few technical issues (game hanging upon exit being the only one) and I can understand why those are generally hard to track down, but UI elements getting stuck, being declared war on by a civ you have not yet met or by your own civ, both Greek civs being able to have the same leader in the same game, diplomacy faux pas penalties despite no transgressions, war weariness not decreasing, painfully obvious production -> gold exploits? These are things that should not make it into the final game, or in worst case be fixed with a release day patch.Significantly worse though is the atrocious AI. I was playing as China, had built a desert hills city where I builder rushed Petra, two turns after it's completed Scythia turns up with an army of horsemen, the city has no fortifications and not a single unit within five-six turns of brisk march. Welp, that city's clearly done for... except the horsemen proceed to parade up and down the flood plains, both city-side and not, rather than bang their heads against my non-existant walls and taking that (better than Civ V pre-nerf power level) sweet sweet wonder. I find an archer somewhere that starts taking pot shots at the horsies, a few turns later I can buy ancient walls and a crossbowman joins the archer and fifteen turns later the riverbank is red with horse- and manblood. Not a single horseman ever attacked the city. I meet Russia, they're so impressed by my culture and science and everything else (they were at least an age, propably two behind me) they want to be bestest friends forever and five turns later they hate me and declare war. Then nothing. More nothing. Twenty turns later a spearman appears. Then two more. Then Tsar Peter offers me the entire russian state earnings and his own personal allowance to please stop the bloodshed. Had he used that money in some other fashion, such as actually funding an army to attack me with the game could have been somewhat challenging.And that's a huge problem, the AI is so bad it makes the game far too easy, and when I as a player make mistakes I'm not punished for them - I'm actually rewarded no matter if I play well or poorly.The barbarian AI is largely far better, which is hilarious in it's own way. Start a large or huge pangea map, plod around for 20-30 turns and you'll typically see several of the other civs succumb to barbarian invasion. Maybe the barbarian AI developers should have a chat with their civ AI colleagues, because the former beats the latter hands down every time.Lastly there's a glaring lack of what I'll categorize as ""interface features"". There's no Civ V-esque option to see terrain tiles clearly separated, because honestly woods and rain forest blend together real well under the fog of war in explored territory, separate desert from plains same story. Hills can be deciphered using the strategic view but otherwise can be tricky to spot. The civilopedia is half-baked at best, not explaining alot of game features and details. Unit stats are scarce, there's melee strength, ranged/bombard, movement, and then there's ""excellent against mounted units"" without any actual numbers, unless you train the unit and there's a mounted unit you can feign an attack on to get the tooltip stats (which are excellent). Why can't I be allowed to see those stats before training the unit? There's no ""restart game"" feature like was added in Civ V after player requests. When starting a new game, the game always uses the same settings (small continents) instead of the settings you last set.Want to use your city attack against that invading knight when you have three other units stationed in the city? How about just clicking on the city with units stationed? Better work on your scroll wheel micro, because you need to zoom in/out a bit to simply be able to click the city instead of something else. Want to see religious follower stats without clicking on a religious unit? Sorry, can't do without clicking on each city.The game is extremely well polished in the art/music deparment, one might not enjoy the style or agree with some of the choices but that's an esthetic choice, not a flaw of the game. The intro movie is absolutely awesome and these set the bar for a great gaming experience. As long as the experience I get is a mediocre one and the AI keep tripping on it's own shoelaces I cannot recommend others paying money for Civ VI. I have no doubt the game will see a string of patches in the near future, but the game needs an AI overhaul to stand the test of time."

The mid-to-late game is just a grind, it's not enjoyable, so the thrill of victory is lost - it's just a relief not to be repeating every other turn ""yes, keep that spy there please"" or ""yes, keep that trade route"".Luxuries - yes, no idea which city is getting what.The ""one more turn"" has been lost. I don't want one more turn. It's basically, after a few hours, boring, not compelling.I'll spin it up again once there's been a patch.

219,350.3,Not Recommended," September 8, 2017",283,"Okay, I've played over 300 hours and I can honestly say this game is pure grade A, extremely overpriced garbage.Pros:Graphics is the only positive aspect of this game. I like how the world looks and feels.Cons:Unfortunately since day one this game has been simply terrible. Most of the games I've played follow the same pattern: I establish a few cities, thinking it may be time to get my trade network up and running and start spreading my religion. No, a t least a couple of other countries declare war on me. They do not bother to show up for quite a number of turns and when they finally do I can usually take them all out with a couple of ranged and one close combat units.The AI is extremely unreasonable when it comes to trade, there is absolutely no point trading, much much easier to just take the resources you want.Wars are generally a slow and painful process. What you need to win almost any war are: 2 - 3 close combat units, 4 - 5 ranges units including two siege units and possibly a general. AI puts up little no resistance. The painful bit is trying to move this collection of units. How on Earth can a unit of archers or warriors occupy the same space as an entire city?! Ever since Civ 5 this has been bugging me. That's not all. Further down the tech tree you start combining units into armies... okay, but why could I not combine them right away? and why can I not combine units of different types? Would make sense, no?Moving on. Diplomacy is a joke. One turn AI is your best friend, the next turn it's declaring war on you because your fleet is not strong enough. The fact that you don't even have access to the sea and have a land army that can crush them in a few turns does not seem to impress them. Then there are frequent splash screens with AI leaders delivering ""important"" messaged. My favourite is when Gorgo has been popping up for 10 turns in a row asking ""Where's the honour?"".It is painfully slow, especially at the later stages. I've stopped playing on huge maps because after gunpowder I found it can easily take 5 minutes for one turn to complete. My rig ain't the fasters thing around but it's a reasonably modern machine that's capable of running GTA 5 on good graphics settings.\Religion... this is a pain in this game. From my experience, even if you manage to establish your religion first you will be invaded by a horde of missionaries many turns later. But then again you can ask the AI to stop converting your cities and it works. For about 1 - 5 turns. So you are left with no other option but to go to war to stop those pests from converting your cities. Usually you want to completely destroy the country to never have their missionaries again. Well, okay, that may be fitting for middle ages. But what of the modern age? Why can I not adopt a policy that would allow me to have multiple religions coexist in my country?Air units are a joke. Firstly you need an airfield that occupies the same space as any given world wonder, mountain, lake, district or anything else. It holds a very limited number of air units and is practically useless. At least in all of my games I've either had to conquer everything well before airplanes could be useful, or did not actually even need to use them.This game manages to reduce governing an empire to the most simple and primitive of functions. There is absolutely nothing challenging in it. Riots, shadow politics, plots, social reforms, government crisis, miner strikes, crime and syndicates, nationalism... those are just some of the things that will never be in the game.I realise some of these thing might have been partially fixed, and there have been some improvements, but the majority of these problems are still there. Instead of fixing this game devs just keep adding new civs for unreasonable prices. The last straw for me was Germany saying that nuclear weapons are the future well before any civ even discovered iron..."
488,74.9,Not Recommended, March 7,93,"I can honestly say that I've given this game a real chance. I just can't recomend this game in its current state. The only improvements the developers really made from the last game (Civ V) are the districts and how wonders work/are placed, whereas every other annoying thing was left unchanged.The diplomacy between other civs is awful (take my deal or I hate you, have the same government or I hate you, taking back a city of yours that a Civ conqured = MAJOR warmongering penalty, etc etc), barbarians still leave other civs alone to focus manily on human players, the computer Civs will still beat you to building a wonder even if you're down to one turn 30% of the time, the computer Civs will still bypass great available land to plunk a city down right next to you in a so-so spot, the game still auto-bounces you back and forth across the map when you have a large army, the culture/tourism vicotry condition is overly complicated with no real explanation on how it works found in the game, the way builders are implimented and the fact that you can't build your own roads (it's done automaticly through merchent trade routes) unitl you get pretty far down the tech tree is a horrendous mechanic, the technology tree is much shorter (even on king+ difficulties I can get a science victory by the early 1900s), the way trade routes work now makes money completely irrelevant (by 1/3 through any playthrough on any difficulty I'm making so much money I never need to worry about it), half of the Civs have RNG style perks (i.e. Bonus for jungle tiles, bonus for costal, bonus for pastures, etc.) and if you don't start by your Civs inparticular bonus you're screwed, most of the Civs bonuses are basically useless and don't help you reach one of the victory conditions, the Civs art style makes the game look like it was designed for 10 year-olds, and I'm sure a couple more things I can't think of atm.All in all, DO NOT buy this game at full price. In fact, I wouldn't buy this for more than 75% off. If you've read this and you're still interested I would wait until the two or three expansions (that you know are coming) and the dozen or so dlc packs are released and buy them all together in a large package for a sizable discount.*edited for spelling*"
175,16.3,Not Recommended," November 20, 2016",784,"This is the first Steam review I have ever written. I am prompted to write this based on how disappointed I am in this game. I have owned every single version of Civilization since Civ 1, including Alpha Centauri, and this is the first version I would not recommend.Here are my opinions of the “Good”, the “Marginally Bad”, and the “Really Bad”.GOOD:Temporary Builders: I did not like this at first, but have come around to appreciating the design choice to have builders expire after 3 uses. It keeps the unit clutter down, and forces the player to make productions choices all throughout the game.Military Unit Scaling: This seems improved. There are no longer such big jumps in unit power that used to occur at particular times in the tech tree. Unit’s gradually improve as you tech-up in a more sensible way.Barbarians: The game designers clearly put a lot of work into this, and it shows. Barbarians are challenging and fun. It adds a real threat to the early-game.City State and Envoys: I like the envoy mechanism of influencing city-states. It seems more realistic and natural than the Civ-5 system.Civ Selection: I do like the new civ and leader selections.MARGINALLY BAD (or Needs Improvement):Districts: I like the design concept of districts… the need to plan ahead for city development. It’s a nice design feature, but I feel that there could be some improvement in how it’s implemented. First, there needs to be more non-district building options. Historically, cities do specialize, but not to the extent pushed in this game. There needs to be more basic city improvements that are not tied to districts. Also, some districts are poorly thought out… the Entertainment Complex comes to mind. Every city needs amenities to be healthy, so forcing the player to use up a district for these improvements runs counter to the city-specializing concept.Roads: If Builders expire after 3 uses, then there are problems with using them to build roads… you would have to make tons of them to get anywhere. However, auto constructing roads along trade routes is not a sensible fix to that problem. Instead, they should have added a road-builder unit that also expires… after maybe 6 uses or so. As it stands, you end up choosing trade-routes in the early game more for building roads where you need them, rather than for the trade you receive. This is counter to the idea of trade-routes. Apparently, the designers didn’t understand how advanced players use roads as both a military tool and exploration tool. And historically, roads were built for these reasons just as much as for trade.Graphical Design: I don’t hate the cartoony graphics, but I don’t really like them either. Also, although it does make for a clearly defined map, the additional graphical touches tend to clutter up the map more than in previous games. Also, for some resources, it’s not as easy to see at a glance the difference between improved and not improved as it used to be in Civ-5. I much prefer the Civ-5 graphical aesthetic.Culture: I see what they were attempting with the separate culture tree… they clearly desired to allow more customization of your Civ. In practice though, culture doesn’t really end up feeling like culture anymore, and just feels like an alternate tech-tree (and that’s exactly what it is). This approach is more flexible, but something has been lost in the translation. Also, I do like the ability to adjust your cultural benefits on the fly, but it seems too easy and fast. There should be more consequence to doing so than just gold-cost. I miss the days when changing government type was a big-deal, and required careful planning.REALLY BAD:Diplomacy: This is so bad it gets it’s own subsections…Denouncing: OMG this is bad. The AI civs will start denouncing you early and often for trivial things, and they never stop. I have been denounced for having a different government than an AI civ, for building more wonders than them (is that bad?), for keeping a city that I conquered about 1000 years in the past, etc. I am forced to wonder if the designers have actually played this game at all. It’s ridiculous.Trade deals: The AI civs will propose the most insane trade deals. They always expect you to lose out on every trade deal at a rate of about 2 to 1… they expect you to trade 2 resources for their 1. They never offer better deals, no matter what your relationship. It makes the trade-deal feature a complete waste of time. I hit the escape key the second it pops up without even looking at it anymore.Comments: The AI civs will continually interrupt the game to make senseless comments on everything you do. You get spammed with the diplomacy window almost every turn… and not for anything you have to make a decision about… just random comments. Again, I have to wonder if the designers ever actually played this game.AI (or lack of AI): This is the big one… this is so incredibly bad. I have played well into the Atomic age on King level. All the AI civs were still running around with primitive units while I was driving along their shores with Battleships and building planes. And, I wasn’t even really trying to tech up fast… I was more into exploring the game’s features. This never happened in Civ-5 at the higher levels. Also, unlike previous Civ games, the AI doesn’t know how to build a Civilization. Again, in the Atomic age, there were still many primitive Wonders that were unbuilt and available… like the Colossus and Coliseum… that’s ridiculous. They should just rename it from “Artificial Intelligence” to “Artificial Idiot”.Warmongering Penalty: I had hoped this would get fixed from Civ-5. If someone declares war on you, and you kick their butts and take their cities, you are not a war monger… you’re just effective. However, this game will punish you for that. What are we supposed to do, allow other civs to declare war, and then once they start losing let them off the hook just to have them do it again 10 years later? The game should keep track of who started hostilities, and adjust accordingly.SUMMARY:Although there have been some improvements in the basic game design from Civ-5 to Civ-6, there are enough misses to make this game a “Do Not Recommend”. The AI is so bad that it makes the game completely unenjoyable. And the Diplomacy is so annoying that even if you like beating up on the “Artificial Idiot”, you will be irritated to the point of just shutting it down. The big design changes… Districts and Culture and interesting but can use some more tweaking… especially Culture.Maybe after an expansion or two that fixes things, this game might be worth it, but as it stands, it’s not. Currently (and yes even at its’ launch) Civ-5 is a much better game."
139,93.7,Not Recommended," January 29, 2017",374,"I really, really wanted to love this game. Early signs were encouraging, Civ IV represents the high water mark of the entire series, even a decade after release, so I was very pleased to read that Firaxis had recruited some of the original Civ IV team.Civ VI brings some new concepts on board, namely the ability to divide your sprawling city into districts, with a limited number of spaces available for cultural wonders. Also, you now have not one, but two research streams to manage - one for technology and the other for social policy. New policy discoveries unlock new forms of government in the same way that new technologies will unlock military units. Also, the AI has been tweaked, with each rival civilization pursuing their own public and hidden agendas. Moreover, the barbarian factions of old have been rehashed and are now more agressive and will continue to be a destabilising influence in the latter stages of the game when they will inexplicably turn up with heavy weaponry and battleships. To cap it all, Sean Bean has been recruited to lend his vocal talents to the game.Early reviews looked very promising and if I'm honest, a little too good to be true. Criticism seemed muted, there were murmurs of gripes at the game's AI but nothing that set alarm bells off, but being a Civ fan, I went ahead and bought it as soon as I could, anyway.First impressions weren't good. The game was galacially slow on my four year old 3750K / 8GB RAM system, with the game being practically unplayable as the AI took an age to complete turns. None of the reviews mentioned this. A subsequent upgrade to a 16GB 6700K helped matters, as the game now chugs along reasonably well but you'll need to pay careful attention to the recommended system spec.Then there's the AI. Your rivals are always placed very close to you so it's extremely difficult to expand your civilization early in the game. The Policy tech tree proves to be a missed opportunity as the various forms of government aren't unlocked until much later in the game compared with Civ IV and V. The AI will also do some inexplicable things, such as forcing a neighbour with no diplomatic disputes and a healthy trade relationship to suddenly declare war on you. War itself is hugely costly in terms of gain vs investment, so you tend to become bogged down in WW1-esque stalemates very quickly. Your opponent will sue for peace, but will inexplicably declare war on you again a few turns later.Hopefully, modders will be able to address some of the criticisms I have levelled at the game. I have no doubt that Firaxis will release the usual spin offs and add ons to Civ VI, but it remains to be seen whether they will fix some of the more frustrating aspects of Civ VI.In summary, the very poor AI, the plodding pace of the game and the sudden outbreaks of unwinnable wars results in a game that simply isn't much fun to play. It pains me to say this, but the game is a huge disappointment and simply isn't worth buying at full RRP. While the issue of game speed will be addressed in time as hardware continues to improve, there's no getting away from the fact that right now you won't be able to enjoy this game or play the larger maps unless you've a high end system sporting a video card with a lot of on-board memory. Even a whizzy PC won't address the terrible AI, however. Perhaps Firaxis will address some of these concerns in a subsequent patch?"
97,49.5,Not Recommended," March 19, 2017",197,"Civilization VI is the equivalent of an European board game. The game built around a longterm plan and executing it, successfully netting you the game if it's built well enough. Civ VI mirrors this. You plan districts around your cities, you time technologic/civic boosts, the movement rules are constrained so that you have to have a defence or offence together at that exact moment, you plan on grabbing wonders and taking great people, and on and on. This isn't necessarily bad game design but it relies on polish and the fact that your opponent is relatively competent. Civ games are notorious about a lack of polish on release and the AI is the AI.Typically what happens is patches upon patches until the game becomes 'workable' or even 'fun'. VI hasn't had anything close to that. Some dominant strategies have been nerfed but that's about it. It just seems so apathetic. I'll highlight the UI for a moment. Easy fix but nothing has actually happened to improve it. But I digress.I'll start with positives - what did VI do well?How do I summarise VI? It's a game with the dreaded death knell words of 'potential' and 'has promise' along with 'good ideas, bad execution'. I can't really say I regret playing the game since I've had fun with it and the money that went to purchasing this game was given to me. I just don't see myself playing much more of the game. It's nothing I will return to like Civ IV or a Paradox game, but it has entertained me. If not everything has to be a deep and significant experience, then VI fits the niche of a fun fling for a few hours. I can't recommend it if you aren't into the whole European board game style theme or if you're looking for a long lasting strategy game. If you're into that style of game, buy on sale and skip the DLC unless you really want to play as Superstralia.[EDIT - Coast has been buffed and I've removed it accordingly from my review. It's definitely not godawful anymore.]"
8,"2,334.3",Not Recommended, February 9,438,"TLDR version:Good ideas and good fixes, however the new mechanics have too little inpact on the game. More importantly; the game needs some balance, badly. (a.k.a They systematically DESTROYED economy!)Long version:I will start with the positive. I'm very enthusiastic about the new mechanics; loyalty, governors and golden/dark ages. They certainly add new dimensions to the game that make it that much more fun and immersive.Also, there are some good fixes that we long yearned for. Most notably; Great General stacking is removed, which is cause for celebration. There are also some nice smaller fixes, interesting new civilisations and wonders, and a nice new archipelago map. Heres to hoping that the other map options get some improvement soon (e.g. team continents, more impact/customisability for 'new world', 'high sea level', 'legendary start' options).Something warranting special mention: online games seem to run a bit smoother now. It is now less common for people to undeliberately disconnect from an online game. This leaves the deliberate part however. There are numerous players that deliberately quit a game prematuraly. They may have various reasons for doing so; they might be disappointed with their starting land.... or their mother might call out that it's past their bedtime.The matter of the fact remains that these players ruin online games, and waste the time of other players. It would be nice if there was an incentive to not quit. For example, 'quitting' stats of players could be tracked, and shown in the lobby. If a player quits WITHOUT just cause, it should be recorded as a quitted game. Just causes could include having your capital captured, quitting but reconnecting within a certain timeframe, or mutually deciding with all players to quit the game (using a voting system)Anyhow, I digress. Since my tone has already become a bit more negative, I will continue with the negative. I should probably use the word 'oportunities' instead, because overal I'm very enthusiastic about the expansion. I can summarise the negative using one single word: 'balance'. Yes, 'balance'. Laugh and call me a budhist if you want.Firstly theres the 'balance' regarding the new mechanics. In my opinion, these aspects have too little impact on the game. Breaking it down per mechanic:Loyalty:Your cities wont rebell unless you do something exceptionally crazy (capture/settle a city both far away from your empire AND surrounded by many foreign cities). Forward/oversettling isn't punished, as long as some other of your cities are near. I think this is a missed opportunity; early oversettling should result in a unstable empire rather than a more stable one.Golden/Dark/Heroic agesBeing in a golden or dark age seems to have too little effect, especially on the early game. The bonusses just don't seem to affect the game that much. Later on, renew the coinage seems very usefull, but since it's harder to get traderoutes (see below), the impact it could make actually fades.GovernorsThis mechanic is actually quite well balanced as is. Most of the governors have interesting and useful abilities that suit different situations and playing styles. However, 5 turns to move a governor on online speed seems a bit harsh. Perhaps you could make this time scale with game speed?Economy nerfingWhen I was talking about 'balance' I was mostly thinking about the changes you made to economy. You implemented various changes that, while having underlying reasons to justify the reasoning, in practice made it absolutely unviable to invest anything in your economy.Don't get me wrong, you deserve to be punished if you compeletely neglect military, and invest 100% of the early game making hubs/harbors. However, currently, it seems that investing any hammers in economy is strictly inferior to spamming units. (In the vanilla game there was a perfect delicate balance that did allow SOME investment in economy.)The culprit: you removed access to early trade routes. Now you do not get a trader slot from districts unless you have built their building (market/ligthouse). To add insult to injury: the gold yields of those buildings have been reduced.I understand the reasoning: it IS silly that an empty district without a building could attract trade. However, the yields of those districts and buildings alone are negligible, making it unviable to invest the time and hammers in them.I will break it down below in some numbers to prove my point:A commercial hub yields about 2 gold per turn (GPT) for an investment of at least 45 hammers (H). since 4G can be used to purchase 1H, it takes over 90 turns (!) to break even. Compare this with the ~ 3 science or ~3H for industrial zones and campuses. Markets are even worse, since they cost 60H for a yield of 2GPT. So you have to make a dead investment of over 100H if you want to unlock a trader (which costs another 25H).If you compare this to a full military approach: for the same cost you can get 3 extra swords or 3.5 horses (4 or 5 respectively with the 50% production cards for classical units). During the ~20 turns your city needs to build the district+building+trader, it will have long been captured by those extra units.I fear that the changes to economy result in the following dominant strategy:Beeline iron working/horseback riding. Hoard initial gold and gold from barbarians (later to be used as buffer to pay unit upkeep). Meanwhile get 3-4 cities and develop them with builders. When you unlock the tech, start brainlessly spamming units. The -1 upkeep card at state workforce will guarantee you have plenty time to capture any civ that does not commit 100% of his resources to early military.Previously you could counter such a strategy by mixing economy in; early access to traders made it possible to get timely returns. The profits could then be used to buy or upgrade units. Now however, you can't afford a dead investment of over 100H that takes over 100 turns to give any returns.Such a game might be fun to play a few times. However, I believe a game will have more replay value if it does NOT have one single dominant strategy. Unfortunately, due to the changes to economy, I feel that the only viable approach is the brainless unit spam detailed above.Now to answer any questions/counter arguments people might raise to this:Q: How is it unfair if it applies to everyone?A: Ofcourse it applies to everyone. I am not saying it provides some exclusive advantage. However, it results in only one viable strategy which takes a lot of variability and fun away from the game.Q: But what about the merchant (or admiral points) you get, surely they are worth something?A: Granted, you do get these points, but they will not yield any early returns that will save you either. If you really want that admiral you should just make ONE harbor, and do an admiral project.Q: Is it not fair to make traderoutes available later because the trade route yields are better now?A: Routes are indeed better, however now they come in such a late point of the game that you wont reap the benefitsTo return to the 'balance' topic: please try to rebalance the impact and usefullness of the new mechanics and economy.My personal suggestion: take an especially good look at the cost and rewards of districts, and their buildings. Either increase the yield of some buildings and/or districts, or reduce the cost of them (half cost commercial hub and harbor districts and buildings would be fair). This is not only an issue for hubs/harbors, entertainment and theatre districts could use some love too.I will end my rant on a more positive note: some very interesting and potent mechanics were implemented. The game has a lot of potential, but unless 'economy' receives a much needed buf, I will be going back to the vanilla version of this game."
162,218.4,Not Recommended," June 18, 2017",300,"Simply put, I cannot recommend the game right now. It's getting patches every season, but the game is in need of some serious and fundamental polishing that firaxis typically only adds in ""major"" expansions. Its no where near as bad as Civ V was at launch, but some things are pretty unbalanced still.(I won't touch on the terrible diplomacy as its been beaten to death, ressurected, then beaten right back down into red paste)My main gripes revolve around research, production, and districts. For one thing, research happens far too quickly. This is especially bad since the game is so stingy on giving you means to increase your production. By the time you reserach, build, and field a unit its practically obsolete. So how do you solve the production hassle? By building a production district! Yet districts get more and more prohibitively expensive as the game progresses. It doesn't take long at all for them to start rivavling... and then surpassing... wonders. Yet these are things we are supposed to be building 2-5 per city! There are 12 districts you can build, so you are supposed to choose wisely and specialize your districts. This one is near the mountains and will make a great research district! Or perhaps your people will find inspiration within the sacred peaks as you build a temple nearby? Well... the answer is actually neither.The crux of hte issue is that these districts increase in cost for every technology you research. So if you jump straight into the early research district? You are just shooting yourself in the foot. Research is already too quick and districts already too expensive to build without making things worse by trying to get an early science lead. So instead of giving us very cheap costs to build a city's first district and making each successive district more and more prohibitively expensive (you know, to meet their actual design goal of specialized cities), you get punished for researching. That mid game city you founded to secure a source of oil? Good luck doing anything with it when it takes 100 turns to build a single district!The workaround is actually trade routes. You get an extra one for every harbor or commerce district you build. Set up all your trade routes as INTERNAL and you gain a substantial production boost. This is the second reason why the concept is broken. Instead of specializing cities and being choosey about your districts, everyone just builds a commercial/harbor district first to get that trade route. So they can get some desperately needed production to build anything at all in any of their cities.So instead of specializing your cities, you are just building the same district over and over and over and over again. Every game its the same. Whatever victory condition you are actually going for will just have to be the second or third district built. Science is too fast, which skyrockets district costs. Districts that are needed to build virtually anything worthwhile in the game.Thus, my hope is that they will give a much needed reblance to these systems in a future major expansion. Then the game will get an ultimate edition that packages all the cash-grab DLC together, with the needed expansion(s), for a reasonable price.If you really need a Civ fix until them, just replay V.

191,301.9,Not Recommended," November 6, 2017",166,"I really, genuinely want to recommend this game. It's definitely got some fun to it and has some very neat systems in place. Districts and adjacency bonuses, while not perfect, add a layer of strategy and planning that I appreciate. Wonders being moved to tiles instead of cities deters wonder whoring and adds potential for greater effects. Civs feel a bit more fleshed out and varied -- DLC civs in particular, mind you -- in terms of both abilities and playstyles. The science/civic tree split both makes sense and, alongside governments and policy cards, feels better than social policies did in Civ V. Religion, Espionage, and City States have much more depth and impact than they had in Civ V. Mods are easier to impliment and switch out and don't disable achievements. And I do have to commend Firaxis for recognizing complaints and giving Digital Deluxe folks 3 more civs than initially promised.But the AI is ditzy and unforgiving. Agendas kill diplomacy completely and lead to rapid denouncements. The soundtrack is inferior to Civ V and very repetitive. The tech tree is paltry and poorly connected (researching flight before I can even build castles? Swordsmen progressing to musketmen progressing to modern infantry?). The late game is astoundingly boring. Movement of units is slow and stiff. Barbarians come in nigh-insurmountable droves. Sean Bean's readings are boring and the quotes he reads are lame. Hotfixes have to wait for slow, periodic patches, leaving glaring bugs in the game for longer than they should be. Not to mention the blatant cashgrabbing with how DLC is handled (The full game is $80, let's be real). It's genuinely repulsive to see Civ stoop to this level.tl;dr it's almost there, and is fun in some aspects, but ultimately falls flat and has some glaring issues that keep it from being truly enjoyable."

It allows much more diversity when planning how to plan your cities.~New Policy system is quite unique and fresh. That being said I would love to see the indrodution of having to choose negative policies. (your Government can be all positive ya know)~less reliance on building wonders (Civ 5 you pretty much win the game if you could build the wonders before your opponents)~City states have been greatly updated since civ 5 (all kinds of unique and cool bonuses)~improved multiplayer. (Way better then Civ 5)~Great people now have new system which is really coolCons~~ AI is terrible. Prob the worst AI I have ever seen. Not only are the AI absolutely terrible at combat but they often impossible to please. ie. most every game i have played result in every nation being Angry at me even when i have never declared war.+note on AI in all the games i played it was clear that some of the AI Leaders have clear Advantages over the other AI leaders. For example Germany was almost Always at the top, and Egypt at the bottom of the score board.+ note AI has been receving updates and may improve in the future.~ Religion Has not changed at all since Civ 5 . (the Ai also spams missionaries and apostles and blankets your map with them, this can be really irritating)~ Personally I did not like the art direction, after Civ 5 i was hoping that the developers would pursue a more realistic aproach to the the next game. The leaders look extreamly goofy in my opinion.~ No Dlipomatic victory yet ( There is now a Religion victory)~ Diplomacy with AI is Pretty Bad~ Alliances with AI are pointless ( if you get attacked you ally will never come to help you)I could go on but, these are the main points I feel should be brought up. I want to say i was really torn on to give a positive or a negative review. there are lots of things that i liked but there are also things that i wish that could be undone. If you are a Civ fan I can't really say if you will like it or not, it has it's weaknesses and strengths. I would say if its on sale buy it but, at its current price its not worth it. Hopefully the DLC will spice things up in the future.~Locomotohobo"
144,455.8,Not Recommended, February 22,245,"As someone who's spent almost 400 hours on this game and will very likely spend much more in this, it's disheartening that I have to make this review.Civ 6 has a lot of problems. It has some cool features too, but many, many problems.First, the good, since this list will be shorter.1. The district and wonder mechanics are the shining beacon of this game. And, sadly, the only beacon of this game. While it's odd at times and can be confusing for people new to 6, properly utilizing districts can have amazing returns. Especially if you use mods that make the gameplay actually remotely viable (omnibus, loaded districts, quo's, etc). Wonders taking up a tile can hurt, but it also provides massive benefits... assuming, of course, you're using mods (wondrous wonders, quo's, etc). natural wonders also make a comeback, and often provide amazing bonuses themselves (dead sea making your scouts immortal against the barbarian horde lol, the new mountain allowing units to ignore hills... until they get promoted for some reason?), though many are usually decent at best, and some are downright weak. Districts also helps combat the ""build a city every 4 tiles in a grid"" that you see in all of the earlier civs. Due to taking up tiles on their own, cities need more tiles to be able to remain self-sufficient. Getting ""good"" cities (where each of your districts have several yield points) means spreading your districts out (unless you're japan). Cities take more space than they did in earlier games, and compacting your cities now means you're worse off than in the earlier civ games, when you could build markets and libraries without issue in your 7-hex/9 square city. Really, the introduction of districts has done a lot for the game, and is the single best feature of the game, even with the new expansion.2. Speaking of the expansion, thank god they didn't pull another ""we're removing a base feature from older games and making you pay a bunch to have it back again"". Golden ages were re-introduced, but they behave completely different from the same of older games. There's loyalty, which is the peaceful city grabbing, but it doesn't count as re-adding base features for a different reason, and I'll leave that for later. The ages mechanic is actually interesting, the dedications are very powerful (if you can get a golden age), and strategic dark ages can result in steamrolling the enemy, -especially- if you can get a golden age afterwards. That said, if you're playing on slower games (like marathon), it ranges from very difficult to nigh-impossible to not get a golden age, much less get a dark age (a problem made worse with 8 ages of pace later in the game, but they're working on that, and that doesn't effect the middle of the game)... unless you're an AI, of course. So another hopeful mechanic.And that's it for the positives. Now for the negatives.1. The AI. First off I want to mention what difficulty does in civ games (and most games, really). A higher difficulty means the AI gets benefits, and you get disadvantages. It does not have any effect on their ability to actually play, meaning they will behave the same way in easy as in deity. Just that if you play in deity you'll never get any wonders because of said AI benefits. As such, the AI in this game is BAD. A common issue deals with AI simply not expanding, even if they have -plenty- of room or -plenty- of resources to go for. They just don't. Sometimes you'll be in the atomic age and finally go to explore that continent you ignored, find another civ, and they're 3 ages behind you with ONLY A SINGLE CITY. I've had games were 3+ civs did this. Hell, I've had games where I had more cities than everyone else in a 10-player game combined without engaging in any war. The AI has plenty of other problems, as well, sometimes leading to exploits that for a unit to walk back and forth forever without actually attacking you because of how the AI works (though I believe they -might- have fixed this with the expansion - they've had a year and a half to do it, after all). The mod that would fix the AI can't actually do much because of the lack of tools given to modders.2. Speaking of ""year and a half"" and mods, the devs have been completely and utterly irresponsive to practically everything that actually matters. There was no teams when this game came out. ""oh but there's teams now"" some might say, but that doesn't fix the problem. Teams weren't introduced until the Australian Summer update. Neither was any real mod support. Both of these were supposed to be in the game at launch, but weren't, and instead delayed to a ""day 0 patch"", which inevitably turned into a ""month 5"" patch. By then, hype had died down, and anyone who could have been interested in the game lost interest. It went from a game a heard about daily to a game I only remember because I look through my steam list for something to play between burning myself out on other games. I honestly have no clue where the slew of news regarding this game gets its ""it's amazingly popular"" considering the reviews for this game and its DLC are either MIXED or MOSTLY NEGATIVE. But back to the responsiveness, or lack thereof, the team made absolutely no remark to the public over a fix for teams or modding for months, and at one point removed the only evidence they were actually planning on adding it from the code (removed the existing teams code as well as the ""day 0 patch"" comment), which only further served to anger the playerbase that had been waiting for a few months to play the game they pre-ordered (there are a large number of players who -only- play teams). it wasn't until even later that they actually made an official statement remarking that they knew about teams and were planning on fixing it, which seemed more like a remark to the ""they won't speak"" comments than an actual promise to release. Then the Australian Summer patch came and fixed everything, right? Wrong. More bugs were introduced into the game, including a frustrating bug that makes playing the game -extremely- uncomfortable, that's -still in the game a year later with no comment- that's caused by something seemingly -completely disconnected-. If one of your units discovers the edge of the map, it causes the game to stop playing sounds for... some reason? at first it's just one or two actions of a couple units or buttons stop making sounds, or longer periods between music changing, but eventually all sounds other than ambient wind completely disappear, including button clicks, cutscene sounds, all music, and, the most annoying part, barbarian spawns, resulting in the player needing to reload the save in order to fix it... for a couple of turns before it breaks again. this doesn't get fixed until you research satelites or use the debug command ""Reveal All"". For people who play on marathon speed and circumnavigate the world in 150-200 turns, this means spending the next 3-400 turns without sound, or reloading the game. Of course this isn't the only game-ruining bug - the game is chock full of them. A year and 3 civ packs later and R&F comes out... and completely borks mods. Somehow they managed to mess it up so badly that DLC now load after the mods that reference or otherwise rely on, causing a return to the title screen. The only fix for this is to -overwrite core game files-. Overwriting core files is always treated as a last-ditch effort by modders in every game, but in civ 6 it seems practically necessary to get stuff to work properly, with this being the latest affront to modders. So far they haven't commented on this at all. Oh, but I sure am glad they're putting all their effort in making their new hidden agendas less ""sexist""! /sarcI don't have enough characters to finish this review, so I'll continue it in the comments."

16,521.0,Not Recommended," November 3, 2016",758,"**11/24/16 Updated Review - Fall 2016 update** New Rating (6/10)Some improvements have been made to the AI, but it is still ineffective at fielding a modern military and attacking effectively. Also, the warmongering penalties for taking cities still apply irrespective of the war initiator. The ""freeze when exiting to desktop"" bug is unfixed.**Original 11/03/16 Review** (Rating: 4/10)I love history, and I love computer games. Thus, every release of a Civilization game leads me down a path of addiction and lost sleep.This pattern has held true to a certain extent for Civilization 6, but I have to give the newest Civ game some tough love and admit that it is not yet up to par.Let me start out this review by saying I have enjoyed a significant amount of my playtime so far with Civilization 6. I will start with the positives:1. I like the new districts feature, where you must pick a tile for a campus, market, temple, etc., before you build it. This prevents you from having one or two ""supercities"" containing all of your wonders and other important buildings, which never quite felt realistic to me in previous Civ games.2. Some will disagree, but I think the way workers/builders are incorporated in Civ 6 is an improvement. Workers cannot build an infinite number of improvements, as they could in previous Civ games. Now, by default, they can build 3 improvements - but, the improvements are completed instantly. I will accept the trade-off of having to build/buy new workers when I don't have to wait 5 turns for them to complete their work.3. On a related note, in past Civ games (except for Civilization Revolution), you would have to micromanage your workers in order to build roads between your cities (or cities to other nations). In Civ 6, when you build a Trader unit and initiate a trade route, roads are built automatically. I absolutely LOVE this.4. I like the new ""Eureka"" moments that speed up your research when you complete a specific task in the game - these consistent shots of dopamine are quite addictive and encourage you to mix-up your playstyle.5. Diplomacy is a mess (more on this later in the review), but I do appreciate how the interface now gives you a scale of how much a leader likes/dislikes you and the reasons for their attitude towards you.6. The espionage component of the game is greatly enhanced over Civ 5. Now, when you send spies to a given city, you are offered various missions (steal a technology advance, steal gold, sabotage production, etc.).Now, the negatives:1. **BUGS** Some of the bugs/glitches I have encountered have been fairly minor - for example, I had the game crash when I was choosing a diplomatic card/option after researching a specific civic policy (closing out of the pop-up menus and then proceeding was the workaround). Some bugs are just plain weird - I was playing as Teddy Roosevelt (America), met Germany, Germany later declared a joint war on me along with ... Teddy Roosevelt? No, it was actually Arabia (who I had not yet met in the game). One bug, however, is quite aggravating - when I try to exit to the desktop, the game will just sit there. The computer itself is not frozen - I can Ctrl-Alt-Del and sign out of Windows 10 - but it is an irritating inconvenience. Oddly enough, this particular bug did not present itself during my first week of play; it first started happening several days ago when I would play for long periods of time (2+ hours), and now it happens virtually every time I exit (regardless of how long I played).2. **User Interface ** The actual layout of the interface is not terrible, but there are many items of information that are completely missing (or I simply have not found them yet). In Civ 5, you could click the Diplomacy window and be able to instantly see what luxury resources other Civs had to offer, what resources City States had, what trade agreements were currently active, and what wars were currently taking place. ALL of that is gone! So, if I need to trade for some luxuries, I have to click each leader portrait, open the trade screen, and see if they have a surplus luxury they might want to trade. Click-click-click-click-click-click. Do you want to see if a nation is at war with one of your prized City States? Too bad. Want to know when your trade agreement with England will be expiring - or, if you even have a trade agreement with England at all - tough luck. I can't even see what resources I have from trading. If I forget I traded for diamonds 10 turns ago, I might very well trade for it again.3. **Diplomacy is a mess** There's no sugarcoating it. I like the ability to send a delegation/embassy, which will provide you with information about the other nation (sometimes too much information - thanks, but I don't really need to know about each trivial thing a nation does, like building a Settler). Nations have specific agendas - which is neat, except that the agendas almost always conflict with how you have to play the game. For example, one leader does not like nations that interact with City States. If I wanted to cooperate with him, I would have to completely ignore one facet of the game itself.Nations will denounce you all the time. And when they denounce you once, they generally keep doing it indefinitely.To reduce warmongering penalties, you are now given justifications for going to war (casus belli), which is really cool except that sometimes they don't trigger. I once caught an enemy spy, which should have opened a casus belli against that nation, but it didn't.Finally, one of the many things I loved about Civ 5 was when a leader would propose a joint war to you, you could reply in effect ""Sounds good, but can you give me 10 turns to get ready?"" This option is gone in Civ 6, which is very disappointing. Look, I generally don't have an army that is mobilized and ready to go to war on a moment's notice, okay?Want to pledge protection to your favorite City States (as you could in Civ 5)? Can't do it.4. **Amenities** I might be in the minority on this, but I actually liked the overall Happiness meter in Civ 5. It was a straightforward indicator of the happiness/unhappiness level of my nation, and I always enjoyed going into a Golden Age after an extended period of happiness. Now, happiness is determined on a city-by-city basis and is remedied by ""amenities"", which is okay I guess, except that how amenities are calculated is unclear at best. The quickest way to get amenities is by luxury resources, but trading for them is a mess due to the diplomacy interface (see above).5.**AI (lack thereof)**It has been well documented by other reviewers that the AI of other nations in the game is suspect - whether it is waging war, engaging in diplomacy, building cities, etc. I thought the AI in Civ 5 : Brave New World wasn't bad at all - by the modern era, I had developed friendships with other nations that shared my ideology, and nations of opposing ideologies had formed alliances amongst themselves. Couldn't Firaxis have built on this, instead of going back to Square One?6. **No Diplomatic Victory Condition and No World Congress / United Nations** Civ 4 and Civ 5 had Diplomatic Victory Conditions out of the box, and dealing with nations at the World Congress and proposing various resolutions was great fun in Civ 5 : Brave New World. Oh well - I guess certain things had to be saved for the expansions, right?So, at this point, Civ 6 is really a mixed bag. Hopefully patches will clean up the bugs and UI issues, but there is a lot of work that needs to be done in many areas - specifically the AI needs a major upgrade. I hope we don't have to wait for an expansion to get logical, competent play from the CPU.If you're looking for a complete and polished Civ experience, I would recommend sticking with Civ 5 and the Brave New World expansion for now."
83,34.6,Recommended," October 20, 2016",713,"+Intro video.The intro is great. Although it is no Baba Yetu, the video combined with the awesome score had me in chills. The last game's intro was really good as well but this one was just spectacular and a great way to introduce players to what will be an extravagant game.+Main menu.Very good looking and very intuitive. It is much more simple this time around, with few sub-menus that you have to nagivate just to start or continue a game. The options panel has many, many settings. There is also a ""New to Civ VI"" advisor option for returning players. There is now a benchmark to test your system.+Civics and research.I thought, coming into this, that I would not like a second tree, but it in fact helps to expand the gameplay especially with the addition of governments and policies.Research now adds more to your game, not just a building and a unit here and there. The game feels like it is tailoring itself for you quicker than it would in Civ V.+Governments, policies and casus belli.One thing I thought that I was certain to hate was the removal of social policies and the addition of governments and policies, especially with the card system. However, it has turned out to be very useful especially when you need a specific resource like gold or faith, or if there are many barbarians surrounding you. You can unlock more governments and policies in the civics and research trees.Casus belli, which is a justification for war, is a great addition to this game. There are many different casus belli in the game. Declaring a liberation war can be used if someone has captured one of your or one of your allies' cities. The warmonger penalty for this is nothing, but only for the recapture of that city. There is a holy war, which is war on a civilization whose religion has been spread to one or more of your cities. All warmonger penalties for this are halved. There is also a reconquest war, protectorate war and a few more.+Districts.I also thought that I would dislike districts and having to manage each one and finding space to build each one, pre-planning cities etc. But it had turned out to be a service and a great addition to the game. There are many more district types than I had initially realised. This all sums up to a very unique game.+Huge maps. Compared to the pre-installed maps in Civ V, these maps are huge and a treat to explore! I recommend setting the amount of civilizations in your game to upwards of 8. It had taken me over 150 turns to find another civ in a game of 8 civs on Continents. I was really starting to question whether there were any other civs or not.+Great people and promotions. Great people are truly great. Each unique great person has a unique ability, except for the great prophet. This mixes the gameplay up a bit and adds variation.Promotions now have their own tree. They also heal the unit, not to full health though which is still a very nice feature.+Trading, envoys, and builders.Trading takes on a new format which I feel is much more customisable. Traders add roads as they travel and have new bonuses.Envoys are better ways to handle gifts from city states. You do not have to be an ally (or suzerain) with a city state to receive its bonus, just send an envoy.Builders now have charges like Great Prophets, Missionaries and Inquisitors did in Civ V. This might seem like a bad thing, but they get the job done on the turn that you order them to do it.+Game length. In Civilization VI, the developers have stated that they have tried to lower the game length to just get through everything faster. This is definitely a positive thing. Before this game was released, I started a Standard Speed game from Ancient era in Civilization V. After playing for around 10 hours, I was in the industrial era. After around 10 hours on Standard from the Ancient era in Civilization VI, I have almost completed the Research and Civics trees.This helps to filter out all of the repetitiveness and the waiting around and it does a good job at that.+Graphics. The graphics, which can be considered cartoony, I don't mind. The graphics in Civilization V were definitely more realistic than they are in Civilization VI. This doesn't particularly bother me, I don't mind how the graphics look. If anything, the graphics look quite nice. If it bothers you, then consider everything else in the game before you decide to not buy it.+-AI. The AI in the game is okay. The only reason that the AI isn't a negative for me is because I like that they have agendas and the gossip features and how they react to some things that you do. After watching the AI match and reading peoples' complaints, it looks like the AI has multiple issues, like the placement of districts and expanding their civilization. The AI would also declare war and then make a peace treaty soon after. There were pillaged tiles and sitting units for most of the game. These things don't particularly bother me. I can still play a game fine with these issues but it looks like it really riles people up.+-Few glitches at launch. From launch, the game has very few glitches. However, here are some which I have enoucntered. Mousing over the messages which appear on the right of the screen as they did in the previous game does not always reveal what the message is. You need to fiddle with your mouse a bit for it to finally show. Also, meeting a new city-state has three separate messages and it would be nice if they were incorporated into one to unclutter the screen. The game does have a system of making multiple messages into one. It should do this for these city state messages.-Amenities, housing and others. Although it can be fun to micromanage these small additions, it feels more like Cities: Skylines than Civilization in this respect. Being able to queue productions was a neat part of Civ V, but it has been removed from Civ VI."
234,403.0,Not Recommended," December 2, 2016",729,"Let me start out by saying that I want to give this a *good* review. I really, really do. Because for the first 25-30 hours it was a refreshing change from Civ 5 in a lot of ways. Yes, it has its bugs and flaws (Diplomacy in particular), but I figured that Firaxis would be quick to patch out some of these nagging little issues, as well as swiftly release the integrated modding tools (as they had talked plenty about) and that winning combination would help solve these issues and allow modders to add further depth and quality to what I considered a decent basic framework. Certainly, at least, the game actually runs stable and could be played on release, which is more than anyone could say for Civ 5 even today.So why am I giving this a thumbs down?Well, for starters, the diplomacy flaws I mentioned. If you've played Civ 5 you'll remember that once an AI denounced you, that was pretty much it for the rest of the game. You were going to eternally be re-denounced every time the modifier expired. As well, a denunciation from one AI often meant a dogpile of further denunciations from several other leaders in a laughable gongshow of virtual feces slinging that wouldn't end until those AIs were eliminated (Which usually resulted in further denunciation, et cetera)...Well, Firaxis, in their attempts to ""fix"" this somehow actually managed to make it even worse. It seems that in Civ 6, just being a player in the game will get you denounced by AIs. In my first game, I was actually denounced by 3 different leaders in less than 100 turns, and all I did was focus on development inside my own borders. This continued to snowball the entire game until I had every leader, -including my allies-, denouncing and subsequently declaring war on me every few turns without discernible cause. Usually these wars would end in their surrendering and paying me. At one point I was earning 75 GPT in surrender deals across the board Banks HATED me. Learn how I was making 180 GPT with this one simple trick!.Diplomacy rating: Wat/10But Tyler, what about the district system? Surely that's a great addition!Well, I'm glad you asked, poopypants. I like the idea. It's a good idea. It was one of my favorite parts of Endless Legend. And it would be a favorite part here too, if Firaxis didn't manage to make it so My-Steam-Username. For starters, cities generally look like one coherent, sprawling entity. Not so with Civ 6! Apparently Firaxis' definition of a city is ""Looks like a bunch of tile improvements loosely clustered together"". Now, I'm not asking for Cities Skylines when I play Civ 6, but having the ground texture around districts change to something akin to Civ 4's city ground textures, and/or having more of the small buildings fill in the gaps between districts, or just making the districts take up the -whole- tile instead of only occupying about 2/3 of it would all look better than what we got, visually. But visuals aren't all that matters, so here's the real issue with districts:The garbage UI makes it almost impossible to plan them thanks to almost zero information, and it isn't until the late game that you can actually see *all* the effects the location will have on a district. Indeed, I actually had to resort to Reddit to figure out efficient district placement, because Civ 6 itself does such a crap job at providing any useful information. But the real kicker is that I found by late game district planning hardly even mattered. I would build my cities to crank out as much production and gold as they could while completely ignoring the other currencies, and I would somehow still be coming out in first place in 4/5 victory conditions I checked during setup.""Okay so the city building changes are total duds, at least the combat is good right? I mean, Corps and Armies and stuff - pretty cool right?""Oh you naive little bumnugget. I was like you once. Then I tested these systems out. Turns out they fulfill the same role as combat strength promotions in previous Civ games, except now you have to destroy a perfectly good unit (or 2) to use it. I honestly don't know what the hell the point of this was. When they talked about Corps and Armies, they made it sound like you could combine an infantry unit with artillery and AA (for example) and have a unit that, while weaker than those 3 individually, could fulfill the roles of each unit within one tile.What we got however, was again, strength promotions that require you to kill up to 2 units to promote the intended unit.I believe this short clip sums up my feelings on this accurately:""At least Firaxis introduced culturally diverse units like they talked about in Q&As and dev videos!""Fahck you. Digganobz.In other words, no. They gave us the same unit models with different skin tones/paint jobs. So everyone still uses Sherman tanks, it's just that some civs get GREY Sherman tanks, while some get TAN. Or GREEEEEN. OooOOOOOooOOhMuch wow. Such diversity. Very multiculturalism.And your cities? Step backwards. They're diverse up until the industrial age and then they all look identical. I mean, even Civ 5 had at least distinct cities based on ethnicity.""Alright, Captain Crabbypanties, why don't you just get mods for these things then and fix them?""Shut your sausage hole, that's 'MR. Captain Crabbypanties' to you. Also, Firaxis has added Workshop Support after -half a year- of the game being out. Hey, they still failed class, but at least they got at least one point toward their grade. Of course, we're gonig to have to take it away thanks to their DLC policy being straight out of the SEGA bible, but you know. Thought that counts.""Did Firaxis get -anything- right, according to you then!?""Sure, it's just that for everything they got right, they seemed to get 2 things wrong the more I played. The art direction is so-so. I'm *okay* with it, but I'm still not a fan really. If I wanted to play something that looks like Clash of Clans, I'd play Clash of Clans like a filthy casual. It's not unpleasant, it's just... Not what I think of visually when someone says ""Civilization"".They were right about this being the most fleshed-out base game in the series. They've managed to include spying and religion as base game features, which is cool. Leaves more room open for totally new features to the series in further expansions/DLC. However, religion suffers from the same dumb AI as Civ 5 when it comes to picking bonuses and any time you lose a founding to an AI, you can consider it an opportunity completely wasted for the rest of the game. And I really only found spying useful from the perspective of preventing enemy spies from annoyingly destroying my districts. Maybe these systems will get more refining and weight down the line but right now they don't feel particularly influential towards the outcome of a game, at least in singleplayer.Like I said, the bad rating is a huge shame, since Civ 6 has a lot of really great ideas that just haven't been that well executed. I get that it's a first try for a lot of this stuff and new systems take some tweaking and patching to get just right, but until that happens I really can't say that Civ 6 has much going for it right now to make it worth paying $80 CADWould give a 50/50 review if possible."
3,304.1,Not Recommended," November 8, 2016",405,"As someone who has been a hopeless addict since the days of Civilization II, and who was ~still~ playing Civ V up until this release, I was very anxious to finally get my hands on Civ VI. I watched some of the pre-release gameplay on the interwebs, so I was prepared for the most obvious changes. I really, really, ~really~ wanted to love this game.And there are parts that I do love. The new way that cities are managed, where each tile can contain a valuable resource or an even more valuable district, is sublime. Having to pick and choose which cities will focus on what vs. the old method of just building everything everywhere is far more realistic and challenging. The new trade system, which not only increases your gold income but can also provide boosts in science, culture, and production while simultaneously (and freely) building a road network is a huge improvement over past iterations. ""Researching"" cultural advancements as well as technological breakthroughs provides a whole new level of development. Earning and deploying envoys to gradually boost your influence (and rewards) from city states is a fresh new take on that mechanic. Frequently earning boosts to your technological or cultural advancement simply by doing normal activities which you'd have done anyway is great. The amount of thought going into this game, and the obvious efforts to deploy a truly ~new~ Civilization rather than a re-skin of past versions is quite welcome.But for every one of the ""goods"", there is a bad. With so many potential paths toward development and city-building, the game itself can be overwhelming at times. The new, hyper-aggressive barbarians can require far too much effort to contain during the crucial early game. Diplomacy with the AI is just as baffling as ever, if not more so--you'll frequently get cryptic messages from AI leaders which hint to something you're doing well (or not) without explaining what it is, you'll still have AI empires pledging eternal friendship and adoration in one turn and then declaring war on you the next, you'll frequently be offered one-sided trades which hurt your diplomacy rating if refused, and once the AIs have declared war on you (and fought just as ineffectually as ever), you'll be offered a king's ransom to return to peace. The map itself can be difficult to decipher, as some resources look very similar and rain forest tiles have the tendency to obscure goody huts or barbarian camps located within them. Ship-building and intercontinental exploration seems to come a little too soon on the timeline, leading to even more inane (and unskippable) diplomacy screens. Once religions come into play, the missionary spam is unbelievable (and largely unstoppable). The ""sleep"" and ""skip turn"" buttons are easily confused with builders and settlers, making for the possibility of forgetting a unit for centuries. Garrisoned units and city walls do not automatically activate when a hostile unit is within range, but units set to ""fortify until healed"" DO re-activate every time they are attacked. All of this leads to a great deal of unnecessary button-mashing, map scrolling, and waiting for the dang AI to shut up so you can just get on with the next turn.It's that last bit which is perhaps most disappointing in this game--I no longer feel that ""one more turn"" urge which I have in every previous edition of the franchise. I've started numerous games, using different leaders and map settings (and the lack of map options is another downgrade), but I've yet to actually ~finish~ a single game. Each attempt starts the same: found my capital, expand, bump into AI civs, attempt to build up good relations with them, and then end up fighting wars which they cannot possibly win but insist on starting. Meanwhile I'm trying to remember which city just finished which district, deciding whether to produce even more districts, or building within them, or wonders, or military units, or builders & settlers to further expand, or traders for money, or spies for diplomacy, or architects for ruins (but do I have enough buildings to put them in?)...it really is a case of too many options spoiling the whole thing. Oh, and when you tack on keeping track of which cities need more housing or amenities or food to expand...it becomes more of a chore than a form of entertainment.Long-time Civ fans will have already bought this game, so there's no point in making a recommendation to them. Those new to the franchise have probably been actively avoiding it up until now, so there's no point there either. But, on the off chance that you're someone familiar with Civilization who has not yet purchased this version...wait. With some patches and refinements this may well become a very good game, but in its current form it might be worth the money, but it isn't worth the time required to play it."

C6's DLC is extremely expensive in comparison and offers far less content in the base game and DLC.Civilization has always had bad AI, but here it's very bad, especially on the higher difficulties. The AI doesn't ""get smarter"", it cheats: It knows without vision, starts with more units, builds/researches faster. Most of all though, it is unreasonably aggressive, especially early on; you will always enter into war with every AI near you (all at once), regardless of what happens.Some ideas in C6 are also as frusterating as they are interesting.tl;drGet C6 if you want nicer aesthetics and an awesome menu theme.

I am not going to say anything new that hasn't already been complained about in other reviews.The AI is VERY EASY to defeat, but somehow manages to still be a PITA. There is hardly any reasoning to their actions, they stack units in the most awful ways. The AI on harder difficulties seems to measure and then triple the pace of their advancement by the players advancement. They race through science, culture, and religion at a pace that is almost impossible to replicate but yet they are easy to defeat militarly. This shows a clear lack of AI tuning and just plain ole laziness in my eyes, it really is awful.If you somehow have a large and fun game (almost impossible), your save will sometimes not load after a couple of hundred turns. Don't worry, it isn't your computer, it is the POS game again! As a bonus, the AI will be just as messed up when you start another!NO RESTART BUTTON! /throws a Hot Pocket on the floorDo not buy this game for anything over $20.

55,507.8,Not Recommended," December 11, 2016",477,"I've been playing the Civ series since it started. Since IV it seems to be launching broke and being gradually fixed. This one is no different.The AI is horrible. Diplomecy is a joke.The entire game all the AI does is denouce everyone at any chance they are given. All the trade offers are you give them whatever they want, they give you nothing, or 1 gold per turn. You ask for something from them, they want all the gold you make per turn...Let's say you have a hug set of cities with a small amount of space not taken up either in between your cities because the land is worthless desert or up north there is just a bit of snow.

All you need is a ranged unit in your city and they don't stand a chance. they just trickle in and you poke them back one at a time.When you retaliate for them all coming to get you, and take one of their cities, you're the warmonger, not them...I could go on..."
112,82.2,Not Recommended," October 28, 2016",616,"This hurts me. I have been playing Civ since an 11 year old me picked up Civ III complete and lost almost all of his free time to it. But this must be said. In its current state, unless you are a die-hard Civ fan, I would wait for a sale, or stick to a modded Civ V complete.Good:-Districts: At least from an imersion standpoint, the mechanic makes the map feel a little more alive, as everything isn't crammed into a single tile, it helps paint a picture of large urban centers with smaller towns scattered around the map. Also, since districts gain bonuses from each other, natural wonders, improvements, and terrain features, it can be a lot of fun to plot out your cities to ensure maximum effeciency. Tall play is encouraged with districts as well. Factories, for example can boost the production for all cities within a certain radius, not just the city they are attached to. Overall, districts are a fun addition to the game.-Art: This is subjective. Some hate it, some love it, and I am in the latter category. I like how the fog of war looks like an old map, it's a nice upgrade from the old clouds of yesteryear. I don't mind the leader animations, and I think some are quite nice/adorable (Victoria's denouncement animation, it is adorable, watch it).-Barbarians: Actually a threat rather than a nuisance. Though perhaps they are too good for the civ AI to handle. See the bad section.-Music: Really good. Especially that intro/menu theme. Don't know if it will win a Grammy like Baba Yetu did, but it is still really beautiful song.Bad:-The AI... My gods, the AI. Do not expect to have any meaningful relationships other than war at this point in the game. I have had several games where I encounter a civ, only for them to break the game's own diplomatic rules and declare wars on me for no conceivable reason. It wasn't even surprise wars, it was full blown formal wars, and we had just met a turn ago! Good luck to you if the AI will even prosecute said war. Sometimes they don't produce a single unit, other times they flood your lands with units, but stand before your foritifed cities in wonder as you plink away at them. Sometimes the AI gets wiped by barbarians! This mess will hopefully be improved with patches, but this was not a good foot to set off on.-Warmongering and Causus Belli: An awesome idea, courtesy of our friends over at Paradox. If you have a good reason to declare war (religious reasons, liberation, ally needs help) state that reason when you declare war, and warmonger penalties are reduced! Right? Wrong! Even if you have every reason to declare war (reclaim your original capitol), and you are in the right, expect to have the entire world turn their backs on you, or declare war on you in turn. While I haven’t encountered it yet, I am willing to bet that even if you enter a joint war with your ally, they will denounce you as a warmonger, even though they dragged you into the war.-Diplomacy: Let's ignore the infinite warmongering AI for now. While the agenda system works in theory, there are several things that you need to do to win that WILL cause the AI to throw a hissy fit. Settle on a different continent than Victoria? Angry England. Have one less unit than Cleopatra?♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off Egypt. Declare war on someone sharing Theodore's continent? American denouncement. Sumeria harassing city-states and you want in on the fun? Gilgamesh obviously thinks that YOU are the true warmonger. The fact that each leader also has a hidden agenda that you can't see without a rather large investment is a monkey wrench in the works that the diplomacy system can ill afford. You might just be better off having the foreign policy of the DPRK (North Korea) in this game; fortify your borders and lash out at anyone that gets close (along with routing all the food aid to your dear leader).-Happiness: Happiness has gone from an empire-wide resource to a local one, now called amenities. You need a certain number per pop to keep the city happy. This all but requires you to settle near luxuries to keep your cities content. Settle away from them, and the city will be rabid within a few turns. The empire wide system worked. This system, not so much.-UI: The UI royally screws over several mechanics in this game. The poor religious UI is far more confusing than Civ V's pressure system ever was, mis-clicking and mis-selecting cities/units/production tabs will occur frequently. Also, you will experience your civ declaring war on itself at some point, or a civ you haven’t met yet declaring war on you.-Religion: Speaking of that elephant in the room, the theological combat between religious units was a neat idea, but a poorly executed mechanic. There are three religious units, and only two of those can fight. And if the religious victory is on, or Gandhi is in play, expect to get swamped by religious units that the Ai will spawn (sometimes by cheating, I swear) that you can't stop without declaring war on the civ that sent them, or lose your tailored religion to the AI's cult of madness. Turn the victory condition off and hope a mod comes out soon that will disable religion all together or reform it.Ugly:-Districts: They can't be moved once you chose the initial construction site. So if you mis-click (and you will) hope you have an autosave or quick save to go to, otherwise your carefully laid plans will go flying out the window, plunge a few hundred stories, and splatter on the pavement below.-Wonders: This is more of a gripe about how they are placed. While having wonders placed like districts helps to avoid the wonder spam of the older games, it does lead to several problems in my view. Perhaps this only applies to me, a guy who likes his immersion, but why is the Great Library, the structure that holds all of our culture's combined writings, sitting out in the middle of nowhere next to some crazy, mad-max-ian college town, rather than in the heart of our capitol, a city as old as time itself?-Mods: As of now, there is no easy way to apply them without text and file editing, and frankly, not all of us can do that. Hopefully workshop or some other mod system gets implemented soon. Civ V lived (and still lives) on its mods. Heck, mods keep even Beyond Earth somewhat alive. Without them this game is as good as dead. (Disclaimer: I will remove this section once mods are addressed)-Windows Defender: Yeah, it doesn't like this game. Make sure you fix that before attempting to play this on a windows 10 system. There are a few guides on how to do that in the steam forums.Overall, I just can’t recommend this game in its current state. Perhaps you will enjoy it more than I, and if you do, then more power to you. I’m going to wait for a few patches before I try this game again. Hopefully it will be better then, and I can change the rating on this review to a more positive one. Otherwise, its back to my heavily modded CIv V game with me."

I've really tried to like it, but the game is just no fun.I like to play on huge maps with huge empires, but the civilizations in Civ6 are so close by that you have no choice but to go to war after 3 or 4 cities. A war you basically cannot lose. And once you have defeated the AI's directly around you, there really is no reason to stop. You have the armies and AI is truly pitiful in its defense. Any other strategy feels like giving yourself a handicap on purpose.If the fights were fun, it might not matter that much, but they are not. Moving your army around is just slow and boring.

The fast build was fun in the first game, but you were always putting out more builders instead of actually buildings or military units, and while they can get their ""build limit"" upgraded, it's still tedious to keep building them. Workers on Civ5 and CivBE are definitely better.2) Maps. This is probably the WORST FREAKING THING in the game, even worse than AI. You are there, setting map on HUGE, and after two or three turns... YEAH, YOU GUESS IT, YOU HAVE ANOTHER 3 CIV NEAR YOU, AND THEY ARE ALL GOING TO DECLARE WAR ON YOU. What's the point of having HUGE maps if you can't build cities where the hell you want because near you the other civs just keep spamming Settlers?

645,175.1,Not Recommended," February 27, 2017",265,"Turn-Based games are often difficult to get into due to the complexity of their mechanics: planning your moves ahead of your opponent, be it an AI or a human, forces you to think ahead much like chess would do.Getting better at a turn-based game demands from the player the understanding of the metagame in place. This means knowing in advance from your previous knowledge of playing the game, what moves could yield in the desired effect.A basic early game strategy for Civilization VI (one of many) would be to rush Astrology and a Holy Site if you encounter a Natural Wonder in the first turns, so you can get ahead in the religious path with an associated Great Prophet permitting you to create an early religion.This is an example of a meta: you find a Natural Wonder in the early turns (a), you research Astrology (b), you build a Holy Site (c), you get your Great Prophet in time (d), you found your religion (e).There are plenty of those and the secret is to know in advance which one you will use to get to your goals. It's the motto of Civ VI and Sean Bean tells it to you during the trailer when launching the game ""you must adapt and press forward if you are to reach your journey's end"".Now here comes the problem: the AI will actively cockblock your strategy and ruin whatever meta you are trying to go for,In other words the AI will constantly try to counter what you are doing in a way that is unproductive for itself and thus, will focus on destroying whatever sparks of creativity you are trying to put into the damn game.In higher difficulties, this behaviour . It simply gets percentage related boni on everything.It has some good points despite the AI mess however, the art direction is good accross the board and many animations are top-notch despite having a mobile game feel going on (it's only a feel though).Also, It is probably a nice experience when played in multiplayer, with an AI limited to controlling barbarians...Avoid this at all costs if you plan on mostly playing the singleplayer.

Both these trees feel like they have a very real and important impact on your strategy and gameplay, without making you feel like you have to constantly check for optimal routes. This is huge.4. The little things. I can't go over them all, but: linking units, how harbors now work, barbarian AI, naval changes, dipomacy, natural wonders, resources (inc. luxury and strategic), unit upgrades, builders/repairs, and religion all feel so much better in CIV 6. They feel very well designed and not cumbersome at allCons:1. As of now, I think the lategame is worse than in CIV5. It's hard to quantify with my limited playtime but it's not really that much worse. I feel that expansions will offset this.Overall:Early and Midgame are SO much better than CIV5. Lategame is slightly worse than CIV5. I think it's beyond worth it. As a base game, it's almost better than CIV5 withall the expansions, so I'm very excited to see how CIV6 expansions help the game out."
94,127.1,Not Recommended," October 27, 2016",51,"So far I've been through two full games, and I'm finding myself regretting that the only choices for this review are ""Yes"" or ""No""... Let's say that until the game goes through thorough testing and adjusting, I'd have to go for ""No"".It's a Civilization game, just like its precedessors, and as such I've having fun and not regretting my purchase. But my god is the game trying to make it as unfun as possible. The AI goes out of its way to ruin whatever you're trying to achieve, and pushes you toward an aggressive / military game even though you may not wish to.What I like in the Civ franchise is that, contrary to most 4X games, you can have a complete game without ever having to focus on war. In this one, as far as I can tell, it's going to be hard. All other civilizations, not matter what kind of agenda they're pursuing, tend to act irrationally:- their opinion of you swings unbelievably fast from one turn to the next (I assume it happens when you're too close to some behavior threshold and oscillate around it), resulting in an artificially schizophrenic behavior- when you're bargaining and asking them for what they'd like several times in a row, their demand sometimes goes up, sometimes goes down llike a druken-man random generator- barbarians and religious missionaries do only one thing: swamp you. Even when you're first in Faith generation, another civilization will have 4-5 times more missionaries than you and invade your whole territory with them. Even if you're only at turn 10, two barbarian camps can pop next to your only city and produce 2-3 units each to lay siege to itAll games in the series made the AI behave unfairly because the devs have never been able to make it actually strategically sound. But here it reaches new heights of irrationality and stupidity. The game goes from challenging to frustrating, because you see the AI mismanaging its own civilization in order to make you have a bad day, and nothing else. Generating frustration inside the game is good, but outside the game, not so much.Everything related to interactions with other civilization tend to be like that. Perhaps they're so much driven by their newly-added ""agendas"" that they're too busy to care about whatever diplomacy you're trying to do. Perhaps it's the reason why they removed any form of diplomatic victory?This aside, some of the additions to the game are really nice. Managing a town in its full glory, with districts and forcing you to care about the terrain and adjacent buildings, is really pleasant. The UI gives you a much better access to a lot of info than Civ V's UI (with a few strange exceptions, which become noticeable when you're managing a wide civlization and need a thorough overview of all your cities, or when you're having many trade routes).Technically, on Mac the game is good without being great. On a HD7950, it really slows down in the late game, and even went unresponsive a couple of time in the civ leaders cinematics. It also seems to slow down after a few hours, with short freezes after many actions, but comes back to normal after you quit and relaunch. And it's unable to close itself when you click back to desktop, and must be killed.All in all, I'm not too worried: Civ V was a disaster at launch and ended up being a very good game. This one is not a disaster, but it certainly could use some gameplay testing and some bug fixing before it can seriously be recommended to everyone. :)"

I conquered the Civs that were on my continent then spent a bit of time sorting out the empire while I decided whether to go for Science or Domination victory, I destroyed another Civ then before I know it I win a Culture victory, I'd hardly gone for any culture the whole game.I've started again on a higher difficulty but I really don't like the Civ method of making it harder, I want to play against a smarter opponent, not one that just has lower costs etc than me.It seems like the AI is still playing Civ5, totally unaware of all the boosts to technology and civics that are available. It also seems to have a problem upgrading troops meaning it often just has a mass of slingers and warriers while you roll through it with a few tanks and artillery in the late game.While the systems all feel improved the AI doesn't seem capable of using them which makes much of it pretty pointless.I'm pretty sure Civ6 will be a really great Civ game, but they need to put a LOT of work into the AI to make it happen. If it does I'll happily change my review.EDIT: 02/11/16 minor edit regarding AI capabilities."
358,27.0,Recommended," October 20, 2016",360,"First impression: Christopher Tin delivers again. The menu theme may not be Baba Yetu, but it's pretty damn close. Seems I will now have two games where everytime I start them, I have to hang out in the main menu for a few minutes: Civ IV and Civ VI+ Runs flawlessly. Literally haven't encountered any technical issues so far. Loading and such seems smoother than Civ V.+ More Micro-managing (probably a minus for some people)+ How disctrics and builders work are a nice addition. Even if they don't actually change much from how workers functioned in previous installments, it makes the game fresh.+ I like how policies work+/- I'm not a fan of the ""cartoon"" look of the units. However cities, buildings and the fog of war are spectacular+/- Features. I'm liking ALL the new features that they've added. The ones they've changed, I like too. However, the ones that are missing, I'm missing. Overall this might be a plus though, might move it later- Some bugs, nothing game breaking so far though- Diplomacy seems... sketchy. As in, needs fixing much like Civ V did with expansions (iirc). I like how the different Civs seem to have more personality thoughUpdate: Diplomacy seems to have the same problem that it had at the start of Civ V (vanilla), it feels random. Don't know if I've just been unlucky and triggered several opposing Civ hidden agendas or if this is indeed the case.UPDATE: After som experimenting, seems like the AI likes to declare war against you if they think they can beat you. So if your army is small - war. Of course, to some extent this has ALWAYS happened in Civ, but it happens constantly in this game if you play a certain ""style"". I guess that makes for more ""realistic"" AI, as that is how multiplayer matches often play out. But for people like me, who always prefered playing for culture victories, this is a big minus. Not enough for me to give the game a ""not recommended"", but enough for me to say ""untill they fix this, I'd recommend Civ V + DLCs more"". And I'd like to add that trying to spice up the diplomacy formula is a good idea, but it needs tweaking.I'm really liking it so far. It is in not perfect, but it freshens up the Civ formula with some of the new additions and I really like how they didn't take the easy and safe way out with the changes.I remember reading how some things would be ""simplified"" and ""streamlined"", which usually translates to ""we made stuff easier for casuals who can't bother with complex games"". But of all the things I've encountered so far that they've streamlined or simplified, it's all been legit. Nothing that takes away complexity, only things that make for a smoother experience.The issues that I've found so far in the game (Diplomacy and bugs) are hopefully things they'll fix with patches and expansions, just like they did with Civ V. Seems like Civ VI has a bright future ahead of it.Will update review accordingly"
46,16.7,Not Recommended," May 22, 2017",278,"I am not too sure how i feel about Civ VI. I've played this game since I could remember (well, the series) and I absolutely loved it.I remember everytime i played every civ game i would literally play an entire game and spend HOURS at one sitting. I also remember how I wished they made some changes because it was like we were just playing a different skin of the same game.Then CIV 6 came out. I was so excited. I heard the game play was totally different.This is the only CIV game I have never finished one game. True, i've only played 17 hours or so right now, but for me, 17 hours was 17 hours on ONE game for the other CIV games.This game is in dire need of fixing.Case in point, Diplomacy.A nation will be your best friend on one turn and then declare war on you the next turn. At first I thought this was clever espionage, but nope. I wined and dined nations, gave them diamonds, i mean showered them with things that would make the other CIV games your best friend forever, Not in this game. Diplomacy is an utterable sh*tstorm. I cannot count how many times my declared friends sneaked attacked me...and i even tried it on all difficulties and even all different levels of army strengths and government alignments. Nothing helped. Diplomacy is truly broken. I didn't buy this game in late 2016 just because of this issue when i saw all the thumbs down. However, i figured they would have patched this by now.Housing.Dear god is this irritating. They scream for housing, your city stalls and yet no matter the districts, policy improvements, it's never enough. You think you've got a handle on things and 20 turns later your city is screaming at you for more housing. You can't add more districts because there is a population threshold and you can't reach that population threshold because you cannot add more districts.I do love the challenges on the other things like you simply cannot fill your city with wonders anymore...that's realistic. The graphics are nice.But yeah, this game was a complete let down for me."

You'll find all of the features of Civ5 with next to no new mechanics, save districts (now your city can expand to several other tiles, but not in an organic way like Endless Legend) and a new civics system (arguably the only new mechanic that has improved gameplay).First and foremost the main problem is the abismal AI, every facet of their ability is lacking and it makes your decistion making process irrelevant.They will settle on top of you in areas that lack resources for no reason.They will go to war with you across the map and not send any units.They will build both settlers and armies much faster than you canThey will denouce you if you are winning despite being an allyThey will go to war with you constantly regardless of military strength, win or loseThey don't behave like they are actually trying to winThe difficulty that has been built into the game is artificial, the game isn't difficult, you need to do several things to counter the imcompetance of the AI and then you will win. It's just not fun to play, it's less of a strategy game where you build and manage a civilization and more of a puzzel game where once you figure out a few perplexing behaviors every match is easy.If you are planning on buying this to play with friends then maybe this game could be worth it, but there are several other 4K strategy games out there that offer much more for lessDon't even get me started on the DLC which doesn't add any value whatsoever:Scenarios:Want to play a game of civ where all the fun parts of empire building have been done for you, and you only need to click through unit cycles? Check!New civs:Want to pay for single new Civs to play with, when you could just download vastly superior and more thought out civs from the workshop? Check!Other new features:No, just no. They didn't even bother trying to add anything, the DLC is literally just a few new over priced civs.Please avoid this. It's too late for me but you can have your money and your time speak for you.

The cartoony aesthetic may appeal to or repulse, depending on your tastes. I was strongly in the second camp, but found it easy to get used to. Sean Bean's performance as the narrator has received a lot of praise, but doesn't carry the gravity of previous incarnations. Sadly, when put together, these elements make the game feel like you're playing ""Sid Meier's: Civilization Jr.""For now, the DLC situation is frustrating bordering on insulting. Individual civilizations should NOT cost $5.00 USD or any localized equivalent. I felt a sense of sick irony, when rewatching the opening cinematic. A moving video, illustrating the pinnacles of human achievement, which once, literally brought me to tears and convinced me to buy the game. Now when I watch it, I can't help but reflect on Firaxis/2K's greed, and how they are trying to nickel and dime their player base. The lofty ambitions of that intro video feel a bit insincere now.If and when some major DLC is released and bundled in an affordable package, I may change this review.

235,179.3,Not Recommended," October 24, 2016",506,"This is a difficult decision...I thought it was quite fun to play through the first time, but there are some major issues that definitely need to be fixed in order to get me coming back for more.Pros- The visuals are absolutely gorgeous!- There's so much attention to detail, it's insane. I love the way cities are organised ingame (especially when compared to the spray paint city tool of Civ 5). Roads actually connect in meaningful ways rather than cutting through everything and creating unwanted super roundabouts. There's a day/night cycle and cities light up when it gets dark. Flocks of birds travel the map and there are ♥♥♥♥ing chickens wandering around the granaries. With all the details, the world feels much more alive in comparison to the one within Civ 5 and sometimes I just sit there looking at the screen because of it.- The animations are superb and smooth!- The district system is a welcome addition in my opinion and it adds a lot of depth to the game.- City-states are easy to manage and aren't a complete chore like the ones in Civ 5.- The Barbarians can ♥♥♥♥ing annihilate you if you're not careful. They're more of a threat than an annoyance which is actually fun.- The new policy and government system is good fun!- Being able to organise troops into corps and armies is a very nice addition and helps to simplify combat gameplay.- There are some aspects of the AI that have improved from the previous game, but...Cons- Boy can the AI make some stupid decisions. Sometimes spontaneous war can be enjoyable, but when the civ declaring the war has absolutely nothing to gain from it and won't even bother to show up, it's just annoying.- The Agenda System. Great idea, but I feel some of the agendas are stupid and sometimes the penalties are way too high. For example, Ceopatra hates civs that don't have a large army, so if you're not focusing on troop production early on, she'll probably denounce you and declare war on you and every other civilization that doesn't meet her stupid standards. She basically spawns into the game hating a buttload of other civs. The penalties are way to high, and because a lot of the agendas clash in some way, everybody starts hating eachother except Ghandi.- Casus Belli. Another awesome idea, but it didn't really make it easier to declare war without gaining warmonger penalties. For example, in one game Ghandi was converting all of my♥♥♥♥♥♥to his religion so I decided to declare a holy war on his♥♥♥♥♥ This Casus Belli gave me a medium warmonger penalty which I thought would be easy to manage, but as soon as I declared the holy war everybody hated me and denounced me and I lost 14 points to each relationship. So for me, the warmongering penalties are way too high and need to be adjusted.- Theological combat. Again, another cool idea but there isn't enough depth to it. Since there are only 3 religious units, there's not a lot of strategy involved, especially if you're up against Ghandi's theocracy and his religion focused entirely on theological combat. When he came in with that wave of apostles (knowing that the warmonger penalty for holy war was too high), all I could do was wait until he converted everything and remove all the heresy after. Maybe if there were more units and terrain modifiers this could be fun, but for me it just wasted screen space.- It's insanely easy to win a cultural victory. The first time a played I won a cultural victory but I wasn't even aiming for it. I feel like this has something to do with the crazy culture boost from launching a rocket and the fact that you need to focus on culture for a bit in order to get the really juicy policies. It gets the point where in order to get a scientific victory you need to actively neglect your culture and tourism output. This definitely needs a bit of tweaking.What else can I say? This game was fun to play the first couple of times, but with these issues present I don't really feel like playing it more. I want to have alliances clashing over scarce resources and not everybody hating each other because they want more wonders or because they won't bother to settle on my continent. In my opinion there are a lot of small issues that have a big impact on the game, and I can't really recommend it until they are fixed."
233,632.5,Not Recommended," October 30, 2017",13,"Somehow, the AI got even worse compared to Civ 5. This is ridiculous, as it was all ready pretty bad there, but here, it never makes any sense. The cartoony style seems like a step backwards for me, but others seem to not mind, so I might be alone on this one.The districts system upends the older way to manage, expand and settle cities, which isn't necessarily bad, but it seems a bit arbitrary for me. I'm pretty neutral on this change overall, but it doesn't feel as satisfying as older Civs. Building a mega city with all the buildings and all tiles improved was a fun little mini-game I made for my self in Civ 5, which I even enjoyed on lower difficulties. With the districts, unless I ignore them (and get a worse city than I potentially could have), this isn't fun any-more. Not showing yield icons on districts is annoying, since it makes it difficult to compare them with other tiles, both other districts and more conventional tiles.Workers (now builders) only having X uses is really annoying, especially as it's as low as three and can't really be raised much, even in the late game (I got 5 uses out of them in the late game once thanks to a policy, maybe you can raise this by one or two more somehow?).The government types and policies feel much less satisfying compared to Civ 5. Government types seem arbitrary and like they don't really do anything, and the limited number of policy slots compared to the massive amount of policies (half of which seems useless) just makes it annoying to read through. It isn't deep or complex, it doesn't affect much, it's just annoying.Overall, I prefer the style and gameplay of Civ 5. Hopefully patches and expansions will remedy this over time, but it's been year since release, and it still isn't as fun (for me) compared to Civ 5."

Sure, it's not exactly the same as Civ 4 or Civ 5, both very good games in their own right, but it's a lot of fun.I really appreciate all of the unique ways in which the individual Civs stand out from one another. City states are also actually fun to interact with now, as they don't lose influence over time, and each one has a unique bonus that it provides, be it a unique tile improvement or resource boost or what have you.The diplomatic screen is a little easier to navigate, allowing you to jump between other Civs without leaving that interface, which saves a lot of time.The split research and cultural techs make for a fun dichotomy and all of the smaller actions that you can take to speed up research (or gain favor with city states) help to freshen up the gameplay without being overbearing, like the quest system from Beyond Earth.I like that they got creative with support units, such as healers that can help your units recover faster, or balloons that increase the range of your siege units.The districts take a little getting used to, but they aren't as restrictive as I had thought that they would be. You just have to put down a series of similar buildings on one particular tile on the map, which adds a bit of extra strategy to maximize bonuses. There's nothing keeping you from putting down many types of districts for the same city.It's fun and it's got a creative design that keeps the gameplay fresh. Definitely recommended."
311,42.5,Not Recommended," August 4, 2017",37,"This game should be the ultimate example of a step down from its predecessor. Civ 6 underwent a huge transformation to make it feel like a new Civilization experience, but instead falls flat on it's face and feels shallow, empty, and lazy.The game is random, unfair, and lacks almost any element of strategy. Building relationships with other leaders is pointless because they will inevitably hate you because of their ""hidden agenda"". What this means is, this particular Civ has a condition on which they will either worship you as god incarnate or hate your guts. This agenda by the way is totally arbitrary, and coulde be absolutely anything, and is based on nothing - not historical nor gameplay related. For example, by turn 44, Gandhi can hate you for not stockpiling, producing or using nuclear weapons. This, however, does not matter. As if the AI decides to declare war on you, it will immediately send its units into your borders in the wrong order, become confused, leave, and then die.If you were a fan of the animated leader interactions of Civ 5, then prepare to be disappointed. This game makes all of history's great leaders look like some sort of pixar animator's demented fever dream. If you thought Civ 5's Garfield Bismarck was bad, prepare to be stunned. The leaders are also nearly mute. Only opening their mouths to say hello, declare war, die, or tell you off for fulfilling or not fulfilling their criteria you had no control over, and were unaware of.Its not all bad though. The civs are pretty unique, each having abilities wildly different from the others. This does also mean however that some civs are guaranteed winners almost every time a human picks them, and some are absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ (Harald Hardrada).This game is a giant♥♥♥♥♥♥on the Civilization series and a♥♥♥♥♥♥in the♥♥♥♥♥♥to anyone who plays it."

Because let's be honest, it's a Civ game - this version will last about 3-5 years and not be GREAT till about year 4 lol.My own personal gripes:1) Diplomacy is pointless. No matter what you do, the AI will like and dislike you randomly. The devlopers tried making it more complex, and in doing so just broke it lol. They should really know their game and their players by now. We don't want a Diplomacy simulator. Though if we did, we'd want it to actually work lol. No, what we want is to create our own CIVILIZATION. Oddly enough that is implied in the title of the game lol. So stop trying to turn the series into a hodge podge of everything. Other Civs should be obstacles or tools.I miss being able to gift technology to another Civ. I miss being able to bribe them into attacking each other. Felt like a game of chess. Not ...whatever this mixed up crap is now. Oh I built the pyramids, now everyone hates me. Well, shoot. Oh I did nothing for 10 turns except build buildings and the like. BUT BECAUSE I DIDN'T EXPAND, everyone hates me. Alright, I've expanded....denounced lolCome on.2) Barbarians. Used to be just minorly annoying. An obstacle or resource during the early game, and forgotten about mid to late game. AS IT SHOULD BE!Now, seems raging barbarians is just the default setting. With districts and the fact builders have limited charges - they capture a builder or damage an improvement, and you're set back way more than you should be. Fair enough though - a challenge. However, it doesn't FEEL like a challenge. Feels like a fly buzzing in your ear. Challenge in killing the fly, but you'd rather it just leave you the h3ll alone.Either make the Barbarians what they WERE, or make them more relevant - with named barbarian generals, greater perks for beating them, and maybe barbian held cities. Instead of, oh here are 5 camps around you that spit a unit out every few turns. Have fun rebuilding workers and traders.3) Builders. Do not like limited uses. At all. I mean, I get it - they build stuff instantly now, so have to nerf it down to make for balanced gameplay. That said....it takes the same amount of time only in a less realistic way. Building things SHOULD take turns to complete. When have you ever seen a building or mine erected instantly out of thin air? lol Having builders not burn out too is MORE realistic.Revert it back please. It's annoying and really throws off the flow of the game.My gripes aside, the game itself is not worth buying RIGHT NOW. Wait till they add more Civs. Because it's pretty sparse at the moment. They touted the whole, ""ohh now the same Civ can have different leaders with different agendas and different perks"" only....by that they meant Greece. Greece and only Greece lol. Also, seems you can have both Greek Civs on the same map. Really odd. And btw, the perks aren't that much different from each other lol.Wait till they add more stuff. Get the game. Have fun.

I have waited till I got a good view on some of the things that can be adressed and improved upon.I will try to use screenshots if I am able but since I am writing this review when I came back from work, please excuse any typo's and other faults you come across.I loved civ 5 and was looking forward to this game a lot. Let me state that this is BY FAR the best base release of a civilization itteration. many of you will remember CIV:BE, a game that I personally liked in all honesty.There are quite a few things different from civ 5, they recommend that you use the tutorial if you are new to the game. ALthough it helps a little it doesn't explain how different mechanics work in the game.They stated that they have put a lot of work into the civilopedia. Personally I don't think that it is very helpfull, it gives base information about certain aspects of the game. I recommend reading the darn manual :D It is a good read and a lot more helpfull than a civilopedia thingy.As in all civ games you start with a settler and a warrior, the settler is used to found (start up) cities, now however there is one hell of a big thing to reconsider and that is the availabillity of fresh water.You can use map overlays to let you show where the best spot is to found cities, the main rule, the more green, the better. Also different from past games, in order to have a harbor you do not need a coastal city, you can use a district to place one. More of that later.The research is split into 2 groups, one for your basic research (as you are used to in civ 5) and one civics tree. Although I like the concept it is way to easy to advance in both trees. When you play the game you get them EUREKA moments. It is when you, for example, found a city near the water, that you get a boost (50 percent) of a particular science. This is just to powerfull and the sole reason I researched both trees before (LONG BEFORE) I won the game. This needs to be adressed but for new players this will be helpfull because it makes the game easier.The AI in this game is better then CIV BE but thats not hard to accomplish, it simply isnt on par at the moment with what you would have expected after the heralds of wow moments of the online reviewers.AN example, I am in the atomic erra, one of the AI forces (let's say spain) declared war on me, rightfully so because I like to fight, a lot but my friends know that. SO he attacks me, with spearmen, crosbows and pikemen. SO no biggie, I have tanks and bombs, planes and helicopters. They lost, the game is so badly optimized for the AI that I was able to declare war on every singly faction and still won. The AI does upgrade the units they have, that's a shame.Here is another important change from civ 5, the community seems devided, I myself, am still not sure what I think of it.In Civ 5 you had happiness, or you didnt had any because you took to many wars, here you have amenities. They take some time to get used to, in short you manage city per city and not glabally. In every city you have amenities, they can come from luxaries (spice and diamonds and things like that) or constructions and wonders, you must be made aware that the more cities you have, the harder it is to get the cities in a happy state.The resources (as I have come to understand it, I may be wrong) is that of every resource you get 4 quantities and no more, so the 5th city will need a different resource to make them happy. It is hard to explain but once you play the game it becomes clearish.Now, what I do for dominination victory (you need all capitals for the win) is to raze cities that are NOT important to me, you will NEED to do this when you capture the city because you cant raze a city 5 turns later, thats a huge difference and I like to compare this to civ 4. You can not raze cities that have been capitals.They kinda work the same as in civ 5 but not completely, if you choose a work for them to do (mining, farming etc) they do it INSTANTLY. They can do it (for most civilizations) 3 times at the start of t he game, this can be improved with research later on, I think a max is 5 charges?Once the chargers are used up, the unit dissapears, everytime you use a charge one man will be shown less than a fully charged unit 3 -->2 ---->1 and then nadaThey have added a lot of new units and still I think they could have done more. With research you can now link up to 3 units of the same type in armies (land units) or armada's (sea units)They show this with stars in the shield of the unit. I wish they would have used a different method, one artilliry is one unit and if you link a second artilliry, in my opinion, it should have been visualized as 2 artilleries and then one more for 3 units. Now you get the same representation, one unit but if it is an army, yay, you get 3 stars in its shield. But for the UPT haters this is a nice middleway. I hope modders will add my idea into the game later on.I am tired and will need to end this, to sum some things up that are very unclear to new players:Walls can be build once you have made the proper research, when you have completed the research you can build ancient walls, with these walls your cities can bombard enemies in your land. Without these you are a sitting duck and you will loose cities faster then you can say omg.Now there is a bug I have found, once you have researched a certain civic, walls become obsolete, it doesn't tell you this. You can see this by going into the city build menu and try to build upgrades for your walls (ancient ---> Medieval--->renaissance) They will be greyed out.This happens after researching this civic belowMany ask where the button is to see what and where your units are, they placed it in a rather weird place.At the lower right (after you have clicked a random unit of you on the map, click on the name (for example warrior), a list of your units will pop up.For the moment you can NOT rename cities, this is a weird design on their part, I hope it gets included later on.Renaming units is possible when they have reached level 2, when you click on a unit that has earned a promotion (level 2) you will see a feather, click on that and you will be able to rename your unit and get an achievement in the same process for that :DSo bare this in mind. I will add things later but this massive wall of text is getting out of hand, if you have any questions, do not hesitate to ask me."

171,163.3,Not Recommended," April 24, 2017",356,"I have 674 hours logged in Civilization 5, and what made that game great was the constant refinement provided by WORTHWHILE DLC content. The expansion and development of that game in comparison to this one is a complete joke. If you were to pay the same ammount of money there are FAR LESS features in Civilization 6 as compared to 5. I paid for the digital delux edition expecting the same product I recieved with Civilization 5 which (when paired with the DLC) was a masterpiece in my humble opinion. This is not the case with Civilization 6.There are amazing features in this game, like city development, the districts system, expanded cultures, and a seemingly more expanisve end-game. I am also not opposed to the art style, and felt it did not detract from the game in any meaningful way.However in stark contrast, the AI is absolutely apalling, the diplomacy/warmongering is game breaking, many Civs with military focus are insanely powerful when compared to Civs with religion focus, the lack of world congress, and not to mention that the game is EASY.Here is a guide on how to win at nearly any difficulty: 1) ♥♥♥♥ culture, religion, and diplomacy, and throw that♥♥♥♥♥♥right out the window 2) Have AI declare war on you/declare war on them 3) Have your military chill in your cities with plenty of ranged units 4) Slaughter the AI's army as it throws itself mindlessly against your walls 5) Counter-attack the now militarily inconsiquential AI with a mix of mele at the front backed up by a♥♥♥♥♥♥load of ranged units 6) ProfitWhat the ♥♥♥♥ is happening Firaxis?? Civilization 5 was AMAZING and it showed in your reviews of the game. Then Beyond Earth? Which many people choose to forget as a blemish worth overlooking in the series because it was reasonable to ""try new things"". And now Civilization 6?? Some of the things you did with this game were amazing, and many people love it. But, it's painfully obvious you spent far too much effort on developing very specific aspects of the game while completely neglecting CORE elements of what made running a civilization in previous games fun. It pains me to see all of these new and wonderful ideas sit idle, and grow stagnent while you release DLC that pales in comparison to your previos efforts instead of balancing that with further refining.In summary I am NOT a satisfied customer, I am so dissappointed by the product I have recieved thusfar, and will most certainly NOT be pre-ordering any Civilization game ever again (let alone this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t I have been served as digital ""delux""). This makes me so sad Firaxis. I have LOVED your series since first purchasing Civilization 3, and have since pre-ordered every one of your games plus any available DLC/digital delux content in the Civilization series. I will no longer be doing this.Thank you so much for the good times I had, and I am perfectly willing to change my opinion, and this review of the game if it develops into something I am satisfied with.BUT SERIOUSLY FIX THE BROKEN STUFF, ADD RELEVENT CONTENT, AND STOP GIVING ME 1 OR 2 CIVS EVERY MONTH.

1,22.9,Not Recommended, January 9,352,"Civilization 6 its just >right now< its not nearly as good as Civilization 5, but with time and alot of balancing and fixes it could be just as good, I doubt it'll be better, but it can be just as good imho, and that comes from a hardcore Civer since Civ 1.The problems with Civilization 6 are numerous, from limited options - to bland and highly predictable A.I and unfortunately, the god awful cheating scripts are back on higher difficulties to fake increased difficulty. So, lets start - Barbarians need better options, currently its off or 'rampage mode' since they all have a high spawn rate, they need a more options.Next up is the slow paced gameplay, standard modes pacing is very odd, at times it feels like a Marathon game then quickly speeds up then slows down..the pacing feels all over the place, and because of that - the A.I which tends to follow the date is terms of advancement can suffer too, a classic example of this would be;Player increases research and lets say enters industrial period, the date per turn will usually increase/decrease depending on the date, lets say its 1500AD, the DpT will increase for a while until its more in-line with the era, for some reason that seems to give the A.I huge buffs and they'll rapidly increase in research and power sometimes, heck - I've seen them jump from renaissance period to modern period extremely fast defying all logic, but since I've seen England get Ironclads as early as the 1200AD...honestly it doesn't surprise me since the pacing is definitely way off the mark.A.I is stupid, obvious and stupidly good, the latter is the problem because it will attack with better strategies than the previous games, however the major problems is that alot of the times its rather obvious what its trying to do - such as Sumeria spawning 20 war wagons and then slowly moving them to your civilization to launch a surprise attack...well *I'm* surprised the A.I did that - wow! Another problem is the fact the AI hates human players, to a point there isn't any reason to be nice to them, they'll break every single promise you make with them, they'll attack you relentlessly and the diplomacy is plain weird to a point it just feels broken, don't get me started on how broken the warmonger system is - essentially by late game the world threatre is pretty much everyone hates everyone and denouncing is just rife, and each turn you'll have to face an onslaught of taunts or complaints or more denouncement screens.Another major problem is the fact that the game feels so slow paced compared to previous games, districts take way to long to build, especially late in game where its not uncommon for it to take 30+ turns for one district, because of the pacing issues, making spawling and large civilizations is nearly impossible to do now. I could go on and on here about all the issues, from nitpicking about special ability balance such as Electronics Factory, or how the game suffers from strange bugs that cause input lag, especially late game so I'll just close with this statement again;Other bugs and glitches include units simply being unable to attack for whatever reason, I've personally had this several times. And the fact that the AI does unfortunately cheat, I've seen an enemy civilization that started within 10 squares go from a level 1 city to a level 13 city a mere 36 turns into the game, and then proceed to crank out an insane amount of units or a civilization pumping out a constant stream of Apostle spam. The A.I abuses the Fog of War constantly thoughout the game unfortunately, almost a through-back to the days of Civilization 2 where it would spawn units next to your cities...its not that bad, but almost.For all the people giving the game a bad review based on graphics, please stop doing that because it distracts from the real issues that this game has, and those issues will never be addressed unless we start talking about the real problems, such as the games flaws and terrible A.I. I think, to be really honest - even with the new expansion thats coming, I doubt this game can be saved unless this expansion totally redo's many of the core elements of the game such as diplomacy which currently, simply doesn't work and a better AI fixes need to be done instead of giving unreasonable buffs and bonuses, not to mention the AI abusing the fog of war."
698,56.3,Not Recommended," July 27, 2017",159,"There are many things wrong with this game (civ balance, too much micro-management, bad AI, etc.) but it really comes down to it being the most boring Civ game I've ever played.Beyond Earth was the first mistake and now this is the second. Firaxis has lost 'must buy' status in my book."
535,30.6,Recommended," October 20, 2016",243,"Edit: There is a dedicated tutorial mode which I completely overlooked the first time around. My apologies.TL;DR - After Beyond Earth which I just could not bring myself to play I am hooked to Civ 6. It is a great new game. Civilization 6 is great new entry to the series. I played it straight for 3 hours. Would have played more but reasons. You can go ahead and buy the game. It is nothing like Beyond Earth. It is not a reskin. Everything feels different and plays different. The game is very good looking and runs great. The tutorial could have been better and settings menu more fleshed out. Music is great. The cartoonish graphics compliment the game.So I come here to give my two cents after playing for nearly 3 hours and roughly 200 turns.Graphics: I will start with this because ever since Civ 6 was announced many have been bashing it because it looks cartoony. Trust me, the change in graphics style was a great decision. Had Civ 6 had a simillar type of graphics to Civ 5 everything would look cluttered and not so pretty. After building some districts and settling about 3 cities, the area really looks fleshed out and very good. The units are great to look at. Though I would have liked more animation for units. Like units bleeding and all instead of just their numbers reducing.Gameplay: When I started the game it felt the same as Civ 5 at first but after 20 or turns the changes began to pop up. Everything that Civ 5 had have been improved upon. The freedom has been reduced and there are a lot of constraints now. For example - The builder can only make 3 things after that it vanishes. The builder cannot make improvements. Cities cannot attack unless you have walls, Then to build certain improvements or districts you need to have a certain amount of population. Happiness has been removed and I think this is great. In Civ 5, I was always worried about happiness and always did stuff to keep my hapiness steady. City stated give you quests to complete. No need of building roads now. The tutorial though leaves something to be desired. Even when I selected ""New to Civilization"" mode, the guide did not tell me there are two trees now - Tech and Civic. Though everything can been found in the in game encyclopedia. Alliances can be made with other leaders. I still haven't grasped everything but this is just the gist of things. There are tons more that I have noticed and I am sure there tons which will only show up as I advance more.Settings: The settings are a bit confusing. Most options only have a low or high option. No medium option. But there a lot of settings that can played with. In short the graphics setting menu is not organized at all. Civ 5 menu was better.Music: Music is simply too good this time around. The 25th anniversary OST has all the tracks from Civ 6. Contains some 76 tracks.Optimization: The game runs great. Tons of settings to play around with. So I am sure everybody can find a combination where they can play. Though I would have liked the option to have medium preset too. Hope a patch fixes this. I am sure the performance can be increased more. The game ready drivers are yet to come out and its only the first day."

96,23.4,Not Recommended," May 12, 2017",204,"As hard as I try to like Civ VI, I just can't. Civ VI lacks everything which made Civ V such a fun and addictive game. When I first played Civ V, I was instantly hooked on the gameplay. In my opinion, I felt that my game of Civ V was a dynamic, challenging game where my opponents each strategized and acted in the global scale. In Civ V, I conquered a Civ as Germany and instantly people were concerned about my expansion. Civ V was a mix of balancing agressive conquest without ticking off the other civs. Diplomacy mattered. In Civ VI, nothing the AI does makes sense. A warmongering spartan empire will criticize you for taking a city. Civs will declare war on you for absoluetly no reason and then move no units toward your borders, then beg for a peace deal. Ultimatley you do not feel like your civ is a part of the world.Civ V had interesting, yet understandable, mechanics which really made you feel like you were in control of your civ. Civ VI has a complicated UI which is not helpful. I really still don't know what i'm doing in this game and feel lost. In Civ V, i gained an unersanding in a few hours. I keep telling myself that another game will teach me somtehing that i'm missing that will help me like the game more. However I do appreciate the attempt to make the civs more dynamic by introducing specialty districts and whatnot, however the game is just too broken and not deep. The DLC is overpriced and adds nothing but a few civs and some crappy natural wonders.Overall summary: DLC is empty, meaningless money grabs that don't change anything and probably won't ever, game looks cartoonish and ridiculous and just doesn't work well as an art style with this specific game, ai is broken and makes the player feel like the player rather than another civ, UI is not helpful, mechanics are complicated and not realistic, attempt at dynamic civ ai behavior only makes them more chaotic and unpredictable.Overall Recommendation: If you want a strategy game that is far worth your money, buy civ V Complete. You can get complete on sale during a holiday event for $12. Even at full price I had no regrets. Too poor and can't wait? Buy Civ IV. Another great game with endless mods that are a blast.

This was by far superb to its predecessor in its aesthetics. But that's where it stops in my opinion. The AI is abysmal at this point, knowing next to nothing about fighting a good war. They simply just suck at violence. Which leaves diplomacy, also pretty horrendously implemented. Alliances become fixed throughout the game and don't change dynamically at best, otherwise its just a deranged bloodbath with no end-goals.As for someone who got the deluxe edition, I'm still holding my breath but I feel like I got ripped off with this Viking DLC nonsense. The new wonders are a copy-paste job the way I see it, and I think most people don't care about the scenarios.

192,48.2,Not Recommended," December 2, 2016",245,"48 hours and I'm tired of it, even though I've clocked hundreds upon hundreds of hours in Civ 3-5. That is bad for a Civ game.It simply seems to have little in the way of new discoveries and the system of districts has the nasty side effect that you more often busy yourself with the internal affairs of your empire instead of exploring the world - which gets tedious and uninspiring after you've done it for a few games. Game mechanics like diplomacy, religion and spying feel chorelike. With the lack of map generation options, the crazy AI, the lacklustre rewards for expansion and exploration, the reduced need to find specific strategic resources, it all ends up being pretty samey. I can't put my finger on it but it also feels like the different civs are less unique now.You'd think that focusing on internal affairs would be fun, especially for someone like me who really loves playing the turtle, but you will rarely find a game where an AI will not force you to war, either by settling ridiculously close to you or suicide attacking you. Want to focus a match on culture and science? Forget it, war it is. Want to be a reclusive island civ that colonizes the new world? Forget it, an AI will always spawn at a set distance from you. Want to be a glorious diplomat? Nope, the AI will hate you relentlessly. There also doesn't seem to be much of a way to get ahead without fighting - which gets boring if you've already played countless wars in Civ5.I understand that they've tried to streamline the gameplay a bit, by reducing the different types of units you get through the ages, balancing starting map points more etc. but there's not escaping that this also makes every game more repetative. I prefer my Civ matches to be more assymetrical as it keeps the matches interesting and really increases the replay value. The lack of global happiness (Which was a stupid system in itself) and the addition of the generic entertainment complex now makes luxury resources seem to have much less of an impact on the gameplay - and the spawn rate of resources is less chaotic, which makes for finding especially interesting spots on the map for settling (and fighting over) incredibly rare.There are many good sides to the game as well - but you can find those in the positive reviews. My hopes are that they'll turn this game around with a few wonderful expansions and patches. Until then, look for a sale to pick this one up. There still potential to turns this into a great game and I'll change my review if they do so."

Also, love the new districts addition because it actually makes you focus certain things in each city, not every city can be awesome at everything."
4,221.7,Not Recommended," February 5, 2017",46,"Limited and poorly construed maps are the thing I find most irritating about this game compared to version V. It really feels like they shipped out a product they ran out of time to finish. The computer players act irrationally and often without any decent strategy. If you select a small map, fill it up with civilizations, you'll discover you ended up with a large map (after playing for a while). The setup wizard is lacking appropriate settings to make the game a joy.If you play the one map and size avilable of ""Earth"" you'll never find yourself starting anywhere other than in the Americas. I'd love to know what it'd be like to play in Eurasia or Africa but after restarting 20 times I always started in South America and on occassion North America despite trying several different civilizations.The setup tool never remembers what you selected previously so if you have to click everything to get what you want.There are NO scenarios! Unless you play online in multiplayer. NOT A ONE. But, I they just released the Vikings for an extra $5. How ridicules. You can't create your own maps, scenarios, or mods.There are a lot less civilizations as well.I will say one thing for this game. Because of the limitations and what I spelled out above you will not find it addciting as earlier versions.I'd wait to buy it until after all their B.S. of trying to ring extra money from you for something as petty as a single civlization (e.g. Poland) is over with. This game feels unfinished and the lack of maps, ability to edit and make maps and scenarios makes it a bore. Maybe in a couple years it'd be worth buying."
62,154.5,Not Recommended," November 10, 2017",14,"I bought this game when it first released, excited to see a new edition. I was disappointed with Civ 5 and it's design flaws (no reason to ever build more than 4 cities) but I loved Civ 4 and it's feeling of epic scope. Man, have I been disappointed with this game.There seems to be a preoccupation with the designers of this game to to place an overwhelming emphasis on scarcity, on play mechanics that constantly remind players that they will never get strong enough, wealthy enough, or cultured enough to feel like they've accomplished something. Everything in Civ 6 feels stifling and limited, from terrain limitations and population limits, to resource and ammenity scarcity and a lack of diplomatic options.Putting aside all of the game's technical faults, the fundamentally broken AI, the arduous loading times, and all the other niggling glitches throughout, the crucial fault of Civ 6 is it's lack of imagination, scope, and grandeur. The graphic design is insipid and messy, with cities that never quite come together no matter how advanced you become and leader animations that look like a mobile game. You don't feel like you're controlling an entire civilization; you just feel like you're moving pieces in a board game, battling the AI or other players for points instead of societal progress in some form, be it culture or domination. Any feelings you have about the historical or cultural background of any of the civs or their leaders is pointless, as this does nothing for the game.Civ 6 has a lot of problems, even more than I've laid out here in this rant, but it's biggest sin is that it's boring."
110,35.7,Not Recommended," August 1, 2017",17,"I loved Civ V, sunk over 500 hours in it in the span of a year. Not as much as some other diehard civ fans, mind you, but a respectable amount of time just the same. I bought Civ IV with all its DLCs, and while it felt a little to chunky and cramped for my tastes, I can still see why people enjoy it. That said, I preordered the ""Deluxe"" edition of this game, and was fairly excited to see what the finished product was. I wasn't sure how to feel about the new district and wonder system, but I was willing to give it a chance.And now here I am.This game is just not fun. I do not enjoy it at all. Even mods can't make this exciting.I actually like the new district and wonder layout system, and I think that some of the little things that they added, such as sending envoys to city states and being able to stack certain military units with strategic units, are great additions. The policy system seems alright, not overwhelmingly great, but it had potential. I thought it was great that they replaced happiness with the new amenities system.With that stated...THE ONLY WAY TO WIN ANY TYPE OF VICTORY IN THIS GAME IS THROUGH WAR. Seriously, in Civ V, by the late game, the world would always hate me, but it was understandable because I had already conquered many empires. But this game is ALL ABOUT WAR. Diplomacy is a joke, and an unfunny, broken joke at that. The AI, even your supposed ""friends"" will just randomly declare war on you, often rushing you early game. War is literally the only way to win. Spread your religion through war. Boost your science output by taking it from other civs. Steal culture and great works through wars and peace deals to win a culture victory. Seriously, the easiest and only viable way to win is to be at war almost ALL THE TIME.The AI is still stupidly bad. They just spam out religious units and cover half the map with them so you can't move past them. The other leaders will end up hating you no matter what because the ""cool new agenda system"" is broken. Take someone like China, for instance, who dislikes Civs who have more wonders than them. Is there any possible way that being friends with China will benefit me more than any wonder? No. And considering that being ""friends"" with a civ doesn't mean anything because they will still betray you, it's more like **** NO!Really disappointed with this game. I didn't like the cartoony artwork either.Save your money. Buy Civ V and its DLCs if you really must have a Civ."

In ten turns I couldn't turn out more than one warrior. They cost too much to make that fast. The only way the computer could have gotten them is if they given the units free.Same thing goes with barbarians. They will send out a scout, once the scout sees you it returns to base. If it gets back the barbarians will ramp up production and attack. On the surface it seems like a great system, that the barbarians won't attack until its scout reports on you. Unfortunately as with all other AIs it will be given free units and easily outnumber you within the first 10 turns.If you like playing a warmongering civ you might be able enjoy this game. But if you stop making units for moment just to make a simple granary you will be outmatched and surrounded. And unfortunately this is just the most glaring of several dozen bugs that this game still has.It's a shame too. With the districts, the customizable governments, the civics tree and so many other features it could have been a great game if they took the time to polish it properly.Unfortunately in its current state I would say save your money and buy Civ V instead. It is much more polished and refined than Civ VI and I don't see that changing in the forseeable future."

175,127.0,Not Recommended, February 11,41,"It's a decent civiliztion game. It has a few interesting additions. I like the increased focus on tile management. But all in all it seems skimmed down from civ5. Less units, smaller maps.Religion seems poorly implemented, especially on large or huge maps. Either focus all your attention on it to the exclusion of everything else or gain no benefit.The AI is paticularly psychotic in this game. The smallest things will cause them to go from being your best friend to mortal enemies. Oh, you built a wonder? DENOUNCED!Nothing has been done to improve turn wait times. Even on good hardware, they're worse than previous civilization games. The only way I still play it is to turn off city states.I'll probably get some flack for not reading the fine print and not being psychic at launch. But I feel cheated by the season pass that gave me 6 civilizations that wouldn't spark my interest enough to start up the game and not what was in my opinion the first ""DLC Pack"" advertised. I guess I need to stop trusting game publishers and wait for everything to be released before buying."
239,190.3,Not Recommended," February 23, 2017",88,"Game is currently plagued by horrible AI and Diplomacy. Those two things make the game very bland after first play through to put it simply. There is no diplomacy victory condition in the game yet, guess for a good reason.However it does feel like that feature was cut out from the game to sell it later in some expansion dlc. For example city states have relationship statuses already. They are rather pointless though as they do practically nothing ingame currently.There are many other smaller issues that the game has, but these two issues already make the game more bland than civ 5 was at launch. Yet here they don't have the same excuses because civ 6 uses many resources from civ 5. Transition isn't anywhere near as big as it was from civ 4 to civ 5.There probably won't be any fixes until new expansions. They haven't even touched em so far in this game's life cycle. Only more dlc to sell out in form of new civilizations.Therefore I recommend to stay away from buying this game. Maybe proper time to do so is when the eventual goty/complete edition comes out in far away future. It is rather sad as some new features in this game could be great and show some promise if expanded. Maybe the modders can fix many of the smaller problems, might be a while as they were just released though."
18,130.9,Not Recommended," September 8, 2017",33,"This is the first time I have felt compelled to write a bad review of a Sid Meier Civilization game. What compels me now is that Firaxis has had almost a year to fix some pretty egregious bugs in the game. Instead they have released patch after patch that includes paid downloadable content. Sure these patches also include some bug fixes and AI adjustments, but there are some pretty major bugs in the AI and UX that haven't been touched and have existed since the initial release of the game. I won't list them all again here, there are already many reviews that list the details. But it is time for Firaxis to prove to their loyal customers that they care about them and take a break from their content updates and concentrate on a patch that just includes bug fixes. They should also take some time to work with Aspyr to resolve the cross platform issues that stop the Mac and PC communities from playing the game together. I fear they are doing irreparable harm to the reputation of Sid Meier's Civilization franchise. I know it is a business but stop putting out paid content updates to take time and fix the issues! My guess is that we won't see a true bug fix release until there is a paid expansion pack released."
596,45.9,Not Recommended," October 26, 2016",434,"I'm a huge Civilization fan, and have been since I first played Civ II many years ago. Every single Civ game since Civ II, has been able to provide me with that ""Just one more turn..."" feeling at launch despite any shortcomings or bugs that needed to be ironed out with patches or expansions. I'll even include Beyond Earth in that statement. Sure it had it's flaws, but it had me coming back for more turns (just not as many as IV or V did).I'm sad to say, Civ VI does not provide me with that same feeling at launch. There are numerous issues that I have with the game. Some of these issues I recognize as being based on my personal tastes rather than any fault on the developers part, but the majority of the major issues I have seem to be common complaints I've seen here and elsewhere, and sadly ignored or swept aside by professional reviewers.-The UI is woefully inefficient compared to the UI's in IV and V. While I appreciate the drive to try something new (and I admit, I fell very hard for V's UI and design, I love art deco designs), the UI feels less like a fully fleshed out idea, and more like something that is still in the beta stage, being tweaked and primed before launch.-Tooltips really need a lot of work.-The map and fog of war design can be a bit of an eyesore and confusing to boot. While I'm fine with the ""map"" design for undiscovered territory, the fog of war either needs a color change or complete revamp as it can be confusing and a bit of an eye sore in determining what features and resources lay within the fog of war, as well as where the fog of war ends and where the undiscovered portion of the map begins.-The diplomacy options, while improved (huge fan of the casus belli feature), still need some tweaking. AI players can ask you to remove your troops from their border, but you're unable to make the same request. Why?-Speaking of AI, it still needs a lot of work. Here's a good example, an AI player will ask you to enter a joint war with them. You agree. The very next turn, the very same AI player will denounce you as a warmonger. Uhhhhh, what?-You are given no clear indication how diplomatic bonuses and penalties work, beyond a vague ""War monger +15"", etc. tooltip.-When AI leaders denounce you, their animation screen loads, you see their denunciation, then another screen loads where (until you meet a particular research requirement) your only option is to say goodbye. I know some people hated the way Civ V's diplomacy worked, but I miss it quite a bit compared to this convoluted yet barebones method of telling me that Cleopatra doesn't think I have a very large army every few turns. Honestly, this whole issue could be solved by not forcing me to watch an animation prior to making a choice every time another civ wants to denounce me or make me an offer.-The great people and policy cards feel really sparse. While I think the new system shows promise, it's really aggravating to see the list of cards popup and feel like art assets for each great person or policy wasn't included or ready for launch.-While I think the new mechanics like city districts and the new policy mechanics sounded cool pre-launch, I find myself often confused as to how exactly they and their bonuses work due to the lack of aforementioned tooltips. I get that as I play more, my understanding of them will grow, but it's really frustrating to have to figure it out this way whereas previous Firaxis titles were much much better at communicating how core game mechanics worked.I'm hoping that I can eventually change this review to a recommend in the coming months, but for right now, I realize that while I'm in the minority, I cannot heartedly recommend this game until it gets some serious TLC from Firaxis.There's a great base here for what I think can be a truly fantastic addition to the Civ series, it just needs a lot of work to get there. I hope Firaxis can eventually fix these issues and make this the game I know they're capable of making. Buy at your own risk, for now."
545,164.9,Recommended," October 21, 2016",256,"EDIT: It should be noted that my review pertains to those who have friends to play with regularly, or who like playing with other people in public matches. If you are looking for a single-player strategy game, please buy anything but this. Get Civ 5, Endless Space, or whatever. The AI is so bad I have to assume Firaxis let the inexperienced interns build it, then forgot to send it to QA. If I didn't have friends to play with this would be a negative review.If you remember to compare this to the previous Civilization games as they were on launch and without any DLC, this is the richest release in terms of content yet. Gameplay is a definite step away from past Civilization title features, and this is where it gets divisive. There are many things that veteran Civ or recent Civ 5 players will have to unlearn - such as the fact that cities no longer automatically are able to bombard enemy units, changing up early game quite a bit - which I see as good. Because let's face it: if you didn't want changes to the Civilization games, you wouldn't be (considering) buying a sequel. You'd be playing the previous games.The district system is ingenious. I've played every Civ game since the first and I have never cared about each and every city of mine the way I do here. Because of the way Wonders and Districts are built on the map now instead of inside a city's tile, the layout of your improvements is paramount. Now instead of picking a bonus to build, you actually have to design and plan each time you expand and develop. Because cities are so much more dynamic, the map terrain is now much more important as well - instead of resource markers and city banners, I see mountain ranges offering the promise of protection, lakes aren't just oceans that couldn't commit but instead are sources of fresh water (which now matters) and stretches of forest or rolling hills are lines I can use in a pinch as a defensive measure. I see plots of with potential, not just a board to shuffle my units around on. No other Civ game has managed to make me this interested in a randomly generated map.Units can now be stacked again, to the delight of doomstackers everywhere. However now it is done in a more controlled fashion: combining two identical units makes a Corps. Three forms an Army. When you ""feed"" units to each other to form these Corps or Armies it removes the upkeep from the staked unit, but you can't separate them again; making those first few corps and armies huge tactical considerations. Properly used, stacked units and careful terrain exploitation can change the tide of all but the most hopeless of situations.The AI is truly trash at making any kind of relevant or threating plays. It doesn't promote units. It seems to cheat for religious units as well as military ones, as I can read a city's layout and guess pretty accurately what they should be making per turn and what they should be able to produce. I should be able to, within a certain margin of error correctly guess the size of an army that can be fielded by any given Civ I have eyes on. Here, I cannot.The AI will not engage in wars correctly. It will not attack your defense-less cities, instead prefering to station units around your mostly heavily defended areas - and then never try to cordone your army off or in most cases won't even engage.Outside of the AI, there are many design choices I question. For example, you can no longer rename your settlements or cities. There are only 5 map generation scripts out right now. I know, its because of the DLC but coming from Civ 5's 30-something maps, that was a shock. You can't save match rulesets, so if you want to quickly restart that exact same game you have manually reenter every rule you picked; map type, rainfall, etc nothing stays. Many keybindings and simple but huge functions were either forgotten or removed; things like setting a unit to Alert, or a hit key for fortifying until healed. The 'auto-explore' option is gone.It deserves its own section: The quotes are simply terrible. Don't believe me? Look them up. The narration is not well balanced in terms of quality. Half of the time Sean Bean sounds bored as dirt. Sometimes he sounds great. Occasionally he just sounds downright bad. For what it is worth, after the second game we started we all muted the voicework.---Ultimately though, these things are minor when taken and compared to the whole multiplayer glory of Civ 6. Annoying, yes, but minor. I have faith that they will be fixed, a reputation that Firaxis has earned in my opinion. Anything more, such as new features or expansions will come in good time.I hope to god they fix the AI so I can blanket recommend this game, as it is very good otherwise."

This game is just too frustrating.Background: I started this franchise from Civ 5. I always played from Ancient Era and on Emperor/Immortal difficulty.Reason:1. The A.I. has no ""personality"" at all. In Civ 5, you can sorta guess which civ is more aggressive, which civ is more peaceful. In Civ 6, all civilizations will declare surprise war on you, even Gandhi will join a war against you. All A.I. act EXACTLY the same!2. The barbarian spawn rate is beyond ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥! Early game it's very hard to one-shot barbarian scout. God help you if barbarian spotted your cities, because the barbarian camp will spawn horsemen, horse archers non stop. I once had a game where barbarians had 4 horsemen, 2 horse archers at TURN 30! Even if I had the tech at the start, I don't have to production to produce them so fast! And ♥♥♥♥ you if you say ""just build 3 slingers at the start of every game!"", you think your 3 slingers can defeat horde of horsemen?3. Which brings me to this point: every ♥♥♥♥ing game I have to go ""Animal husbandry -> Archer"" route, talk about diversity of build! In Civ 5, I can go Pottery, Sailing or Archery; but in Civ 6 I have to do the same route every mother♥♥♥♥ing time because the neighbour civ all acts the same and the barbarians are on steroid.4. The AI Civ's forced preference is ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Why would Rome hate me for having smaller territories than him? Shouldn't this make him happier because he got more room to expand? Why would France say ""I don't like the look of what you've been up to. What would your friends think of this information?"" when she denounced me for not having espionage? This makes no sense at all!5. The pacing of this game feels so ♥♥♥♥ing wrong! It takes forever to build a district. It's ♥♥♥♥ing frustrating when you tried to build a harbor for a coastal city with little wood tiles nearby. The time needed for science/civi research compared to time needed for production just feels so mismatched! I reach Medieval Era when my second city haven't finished its first district!6. Everything feels so rushed! On higher difficulty, the A.I. almost always finished everything before you. Beliefs, Wonders, Great Persons... You have to ♥♥♥♥ing beeline to your objective.

40,259.2,Not Recommended," May 5, 2017",288,"I didn't want to do this. I really, really didn't want to do this.I pre-ordered Civ VI and was, admittedly, always skeptical about the release. The trailer, which was popularized almost immediately, worried me. Where was the game footage? Where was the story? Where was the beauty that had become synonymous with the series?When the first screenshots came out, many people's worries were realized. And you have to ask, what effect can graphics really have on games? Certainly, there's genres that can be cartoony and be smashing successes. But doing the same for a historical-strategical game was a bold, bold move. The reprocussion, and consequence, was simple: Civ VI lacks the same draw, the same lure and power that the other editions had. Though I have only 100 hours, I played enough to realize that I can't play any more. It's hard to imagine and immerse yourself in a game where everything has a joking, cartoon aspect to it. I want to build my empire from the ground- that's the feeling most of us had when we were introduced to Civilization. I feel like, now, the game is all about trying to impress me with things I don't necessarily care about. Sure, the cities look nice. But wouldn't it be nicer if I could pan across the world without my eyes bleeding, and I could conduct trade deals with leaders that look realistic and not made to be preposterous?The art style leads into a whole range of other development issues that I find concerning and worrisome. The military system is a disaster. Airforces have been effectively removed from the game with the introduction of districts. The cost to build their respective tile, in addition to the abhorrent production cost of literally everything, makes them useless. I still cannot figure out how to properly attack a city. Is it really that complicated, when I have strong units and my enemy has literally none? Granted, I have been able to win conquests before- but only while the AI was technologically crippled, which makes the feeling and strategy of fighting wars absolutely diminish.Foreign relations make no sense and are always unfavorable. Though patches have been made to make the AI more friendly, it still doesn't feel right, like Civ V. In Civ V, you felt fully in control of your relationship. This was a necessary thing: you, again, felt as if you managed your country and their policies. In Civ VI, you feel helpless. Isolated on a world to yourself, which you continously press next turn to escape.The changes made to make the game more immersive do so, but only on the turn they're implemented. Simply, there's set objectives you have to achieve, and they stay standard across each game. Deity is, essentially, an early-game rushfest. Of course, there are other ways to tackle it- but that's what gets me the most, more than anything. Civ VI ostracizes players that loved the series for what it was: a fun, simulation-strategy game, where your goal was to create the most well-rounded and prosperous empire on the planet.It was never about abusing strategies. It was never about clicking endlessly and hoping for something to happen. YOU made things happen. With Civ VI, I always leave my games feeling empty, yet sad. As much as it pains me, the future of Civ VI is increasingly bleak. So many things are already cemented for it that it would need a massive overhaul to revamp.If you are new to the series and are intrigued by this edition, by all means, purchase it. You have an interest and it's certainly still a Civilization game at the core. If you come from V, stay there. It says a lot in the fact that V has substantially more players than VI."
218,49.8,Not Recommended," October 27, 2016",83,"Steam won't give you a refund after 2 hours of playing this game, so I am writing this review to hopefully save anyone else from wasting their money and not being allowed to get a refund. Because it takes more than 2 hours to see how bad this game actually is.On first glance, this game looks really good. The visual style is neat and well executed, and even if you don't like the cartoony look it's impossible to say that it looks bad. The music is great, and bringing Christopher Tin back was a brilliant move, as the opening music is superb. It's only once you've played the game for a few hours that you notice all the cracks in the makeup.The AI is *horrible.* They will parade units through your land while at war and never attack you. They will keep their warriors until the modern age and never upgrade them, and send them to their deaths against your strongest units. They almost never settle new cities, even when surrounded by land, so as long as you build settlers you are guaranteed to win. They make promises and NEVER keep them. Every AI will happily promise not to convert your cities, then send in 5 apostles the very next turn to convert you. It makes it so the only way you can possibly play is to declare war on your neighbors, for which they never, ever ever forgive you.The game is buggy. It doesn't seem to be able to close without crashing. You will recieve declarations of war from yourself at random during the game. (When playing as Rome, Trajan will appear and declare war on you, even though there are no other Romes in the game.) It's almost impossible to use the city bombard feature, as every time you click it realigns the viewport. The absolutely insane unit selection process will cause you to accidentally right click on distant parts of the map with the wrong unit, sending them off in the wrong direction. When you promise not to convert AI cities, but the city gets naturally converted on its own, you get a diplomacy penalty and a warning for breaking your promise.But worst of all, the game is boring. AI can be improved. Bugs can be fixed. But the game itself is a tedious slog. The problem of having too many workers bogging you down in earlier Civ games has been eliminated, but the same problem was reintroduced as trade routes and spies. Once you enter the atomic era, almost the only thing you do is re-assign spies and trade routes each turn, each of which requires multiple clicks just to get them to keep doing what they were doing. With the AI so bad, very little goes on in the late game except sitting around and reassigning these units.They did a good job of fixing the features in Civ 5 that weren't great, but they didn't really add much to the game. Religion is virtually the same, but slightly more interesting than before. Governments work different, and are one of the genuine improvements on the game, but still feels a little shallow. They didn't really bring much new to the game, but it feels like much has been taken away. It feels very similar to Civ 5, just with much fewer leaders. And with the Aztec civ being released as DLC, it sounds like they have come up with a nasty way of making DLC content -- nickle-and-diming you for leaders and civs. Despite this being number 6 in the series, it has a pathetically small number of starting Civs and leaders. There's a decent representation from around the world, but why must Civ restart with less than 20 Civs at ever new version? It feels like taking a giant step backwards when there is such a long tradition that they could build off of.If you're a die-hard Civ fan who was playing Civ 5 up until the moment this was released, you will probably see it as an improvement (once the attrocious AI and the bugs have been fixed, anyway). If you're a general 4x/history fan, you will probably be sorely disappointed, as there are much better games out there. Civ 6 doesn't innovate, it just reinvents the wheel, and doesn't feel as complete as the previous game in the series."

131,24.4,Not Recommended," September 19, 2017",32,"Product received for freeI'll start off by saying I love the Sid Meier's Civilization series especially Civilization V. When I got the chance to play this game with all the recent DLCs it wasn't easy for me to fall in love with the game despite having features unavailable that made its predecessor a success and new features that are quite unsatisfactory. The best part of playing any Civ game is playing with or against your friends online and games usually take a long time to finish. Unfortunately, when you decide to take a break and the host saves your game for later. You can't play it with the people you played with anymore due to the game glitching. I tried to look for a solution and stumbled upon the steam forums that was dated somewhere around October 2016, yes 2016. It's almost been a year and they haven't fixed it. It's really frustrating. So, for now, until they fix this problem I'm not recommending this game unless all you want is to play singleplayer mode then it's perfectly fine."

Everything about this game felt much smoother than previous Civ games considering this is just the base game, and Firaxis likes to release lots of content. By the way, using units is way more interesting now. YOU CAN DEPLOY AIRPLANES. You don't have to keep them stationed as in the previous Civ games where they had to be in a base! This is probably my favorite feature. lolUPDATE: At first I was worried about the districts limiting my playstyle/freedom, however, it's quite the opposite. It ACTUALLY FEELS like your empire is growing! I used to hate in Civ 5 how all you could do was build and improvement and then just pile a bunch of random buildings for queue in your cities. Now you actually have to make your empire grow! LOVE this new feature.I have to say it now, everyone was skeptical about this game because of Civilization: Beyond Earth, BUT THIS GAME IS PERFECT. Firaxis did an amazing job. Graphics are beautiful, combat is fun, building the empire is so much more detailed. This game is perfect. Also Japan super aggressive. lmao."

I'm not an expert at Civ but have played a little of Civ 5 and I'll be honest, I liked it but didn't really understand the fuss. Civ 6 is a more user friendly game (for me) and one that has already imbedded its claws. I want to understand the different units, find my rivals, build trade routes, hunt barbarians, discover new inventions, build bigger cities etc. I never felt that with Civ 5. Maybe it's 'New car smell' or maybe it really is that good. Only time will tell."

I really tried to give it a fair chance after the disastrous launch.But months later, after the release of paid DLCs the game is still riddled with scripting and AI bugs. It speakes volumes about the developers and publisher's priorities.What’s really sad is that the horrid AI and bug pretty much invalidate what would otherwise be a great product. The devs really didn’t cut out much content form Civ V and its expansions. They brought almost all of it back and improved upon it in some areas. The visuals are – in my opinion – appealing, the music is outstanding, the leaders are great.But what does it matter when the game constantly throws hissy fits at you, starting sensless wars, making AI think you did something other empire actually achieved etc? It’s been months and the issues persist. Terrible example of negligence on the part of the devs. Even at the end when I was trying to quit an uninstall it it managed to force me into hard reset.What a shame :(. Better buy Civ V or play Endless Legend. Much better games."
99,120.8,Recommended," December 29, 2016",12,"For a new edition to the Civilization franchise, Civ VI is very welcomed.(For a quick list of pros/cons, scroll down)A lot of the recent negative reviews come from the recent DLC release with the deluxe edition of the game that promised the next 4 DLCs released to be included with the purchase. Being that the first two DLCs have been released, many people are displeased, but the very simple solution is to not buy something until you know what you are buying. Rather, wait for the DLC to be released and/or wait for a sale to buy it at a cheaper price.Anyways, in terms of the game itself, Civ VI has a lot to offer. Since Civ V, Firaxis has decided to make Civ VI more complex and thoughtful in their approach. Unit stacking, district placement, government styles, new civic tree, and much more all add to the more intricate nature of the game and add many more elements than what was found in Civ V. Civilization VI also swapped out the Diplomatic Victory, arguably the most anti-climactic (aside from Score Victory), the new Faith Victory expands on religion and makes it more prominent. Considering that this is the base game, Civilization VI also offers much more than Civilization V did on release, but it also has just as many if not more bugs than Civ V did on release, as well.And that's the major downfall for Civilization VI: The bugs, clunkiness, & the AI. While a decent chunk of bugs and exploits have been removed with the most recent patches, there's still more to be found, as is typical with Civ releases. And other clunky aspects, such as auto-unit cycle only being able to be disabled through manually digging through configuration files, needing to fight with the city attack button to actually work, not being able to get rid of the hundreds of notifications both on the right and dead center of the screen that blind you in war, some odd menu interfaces, etc need to be desperately addressed. And of course, the final sticking point for anyone looking to primarily enjoy the game for Singleplayer use, the AI is very odd and not so intelligent - getting mad for the tiniest things, unreasonable trade deals, etc.Overall though, these are specific parts of the game that can be dealt with, either by growing accustomed until a patch releases or through mods. But the game is hard to ignore for its great innovations with this new edition to the series and will surely be an even better one as patches (hopefully) roll out soon.PROS:-New Civics Tree-Expanded Espionage Capabilities-More Easily Able to Expand With Cities; Local Happiness-Replaced the Tedious & Anti-Climactic Diplomatic Victory of Civ V with the Faith Victory-Unit Stacking-Unstacks Cities via Districts-More Interesting Science Victory-Better Diplomatic Options (Although still room for improvement)-Increased the Importance of City-States-New Government System-New Policy System-Includes Much More Content At Initial Release Than Many Previous Civ Games Have Had-More Options / Less Reason to Go Down the Same Civic Tree / Tech Tree Every Single Game-New Game Speed for Multiplayer Games-Interesting New Cassus Belli system (Even if it only affects Singleplayer, it's still interesting and fun to use against friends)-Allows for much more early warring-Much MoreCONS:-No Production Queue-Fair Amount of Dead-End Techs/Civics-Clunkiness (Discussed Above)-Cities Can Be Completely Razed in 1 Turn (Regardless of size)-Map Generation is a Hit or Miss-Bad AI-Awful Notifications System-Etc(Items listed in the Pros/Cons lists are not limited to what is written, they are just major points that I personally have noted or experienced.)"
180,147.8,Not Recommended," October 21, 2017",12,"When Civilization VI was announced a lot of people including me were very excited for how Firaxis would expand the series, the district systems and such were extremely promising even though we sort of had districts in Civ V already with the great person improvements.When the first few gameplay videos came a massive wave of disappointment was already being announced and when we finally got to play the game we got even more disappointed in how awfully designed the game is.I have 1037 hours in Civilization V and too many thousands to count in Civ IV but Civ VI is just too boring and I will explain why.The district system is an interesting idea do not get me wrong but the fact that they actually made building tall (high population per city) pointless and you can basically spam as many cities as you want unlimited whereas in Civ V you at least had a form of balance to prevent that.In all Civilization games there were rewards and downsides in going tall and wide (lots of cities) whereas in Civ VI the only benefit is going wide and not tall at all.The districts do not help with this either making your low population cities extremely overpowered. all you need is the commercial, industrial and there you go, the harbour if coastal and/or Holy Site or Campus and basically your city wont have to grow any larger because Civ VI is all about money and production, you rule those you own the game.This is the dumbest way of designing a game the fact that production costs SCALE with how much you produce something is even more idiotic.This was their idea of preventing you spamming cities but it turns out its working against you, want to make more infantry and tanks to fight the wars the dumb AI starts all the time? Oh sorry, you already made too many tanks, its 40 turns to make one now.They also completely ruined culture, its pointless now, I cannot tell whether it has an effect on border growth because they completely butchered the interface and dumbed it so much down its counterproductive.The policy idea is also another great idea but poorly implemented, the idea of enacting your own policies is very nice indeed but it basically costs you nothing, everytime you research a culture policy you can to change your government.This is silly so what is the point of culture? Its basically just like science, its only there to make you progress and the theater square is pretty much pointless as you already can amaze good culture output through buildings and religion.Then we get to the real big ugly flaw of this game, the AI itself, its the worst AI I have seen in a strategy game and believe me I play and have played a LOT of strategy games, I seen AI's from 2002 that are smarter than this and that is sad.The AI was very smart in Civilization IV after the final expansion pack, the AI was pretty dumb in Civ V but even then it was still capable of doing SOMETHING.In Civ VI the AI is utterly useless in war, even with mods the AI is so crippled it scares me, it cannot do basic manouvers it just spams units at you which is pretty silly at least in previous Civ games the AI would try to come up with basic tactics.The AI is also really bad at economy and city placement, early games the AI may be ahead of you but then you suddenly start getting ahead of the AI really fast.As for the graphics this is a matter of taste, but I always prefered the more realistic art look of the previous games than this new cartoon look which looks silly in my opinion, are we playing a game for kids now? You may think so considering how dumbed down the game is in general.I have also noticed how Firaxis are releasing lots of small DLC's, seeing how this is going it looks like they have adopted the Paradox Interactive strategy of just spamming lots of tiny DLC's for what may appear like small prices but when you start adding all these tiny DLC's together you suddenly end up with prices like 100 euro or 300 euro, Europa Universalis IV is probably 400 euro by now if you want all the DLC's.This new strategy by game developers is disgusting and frankly puts me off completely from buying their games in the future, it was bad enough with the death of Expansion Packs and the beginning of DLC's but Firaxis still kept making good DLC's for Civ V.And finally, I want to give Firaxis my middle finger, Civilization V is the most successful strategy game of our time so far, and there still more people playing Civ V today than VI, you could have made MORE profits making DLC's for Civ V and expanding the game further, a lot of people may not realise this but the district system could EASILY been implemented in Civ V, you could have fleshed out the future era, you could have made space colonisation a thing, the fact that Civilization Beyond Earth was not made a DLC for Civ V puzzles me.Game developers today are extremely lazy and it seems Firaxis have joined the club, expanding already extremely successfully game franchises with more content is too much effort these days, Firaxis promised us many years ago to fix Multiplayer in Civ V and add mod support what do we get? An entire new game that costs 60 euro at launch, thank you Firaxis for sinking to a level even EA Games have yet to reach."
245,25.0,Not Recommended," April 4, 2017",114,"So unbelievably boring, simplistic and poorly made. I've played Civilization games continually since the mid 90's, and while I have stopped playing games of Civ IV due to slowdown creep, making it eventually unplayable and stopped playing Civ V games due to unavoidable gamebreaking bugs, never before this game have I stopped a game out of pure boredom.Designed like a mobile game, so that anyone could pick it up and play immediately and not have to worry about making poor decisions. There are no decisions to be made anymore. You're driving down the railroad that Civ VI has laid out for you.Also, Civs and leaders are now fully specialized towards a specific win condition, so no more will you play any civilization through the ages with the same goal in sight. No. Now you play civ A if you're doing scientific victory, because the game is designed that way, OR you play civ B if you're going for conquest, because they're got the vastly superior and useful units and war buildings. No choice, just follow the railroad track.Gameplay-wise, you never do anything but wait for building countdowns. You never have any grand plans, overarching or even sub-goals to achieve. You fight some barbarians here and there, wait for workers to make a field here and orchard there, wait some more for another stop on the dumbed down research railroad track to finish, then wait for some building or other to finish and on and on. There's not once a feeling of excitement about pressing the ""end turn"" button to realize some goal you're trying to achieve. You're just going through the motions, quickly seeing through the game's illusion of choice and just as quickly losing interest.Visually, the game lacks any progression through the ages. This is something Civilization has managed to do since the second game, where you clearly see your empire grow and develop. In Civ VI, everything looks the same, like you are the leader of a fisherman's village, a shepherd's hut and a farmer's community. Your cities never really change, they never really grow or develop with the times. They look like the same huts in 4000 BC as they do in 1000 AD.If you are a fan of the previous Civilization games' freedom to forge a story out of your own designs and choices, you will also hate what Civ VI has done to ""streamline"" the gameplay. It strips every possibility of you making the ""wrong"" choice, and in so doing also strips you of any agency to make your own destiny with your civilization. It's Civilization light, a high-powered mobile game based on real Civilization games.If you're craving a turn-based strategy game, any turn-based strategy game, pick up Civilization V with expansions instead. If you've played literally every other Civ game and still want more, ONLY pick this title up at 60% off or more. It's a poor excuse for Civilization and is utterly uninspired and forgettable."

Also no diplomatic victory (yet).Religion: Religious unit spam, Religious victory broken and op, religious leaders very annoying, theological combat really not worth it.AI: AI not keeping up with tech, AI not upgrading units, AI dumb in combat, etc.Right now I cannot recommend this game.

Compared to that, Civ 6 is a huge step forward.Original review: While the new graphics style might need getting used to by some, there's really not much to complain about. The interface is sleek and polished and the new fog of war (as well as the strategic view) are gorgeous. Same goes for the amazin theme by Christopher Tin. Civilization 6 takes a fresh turn on well-tried mechanics and is changing those that didn't quite work out, as well as introducing a lot of new ones – and they all seem to fit perfectly. The base game includes nearly everything that was in the Civ 5 DLCs. Not everything, but there has to be something left for modding and DLC, right?

I think the problem is 1upt, the AI can't use it effectively.Even as a human player, it is difficult to juggle around units like you are playing some digital puzzle game.city states get a lot of extra units. Creating huge traffic jams.I don't think their AI can handle 1upt, this was a problem in civ5 and was meant to be somewhat solved by merging units.However in my game so far, this has not helped much.I had two city states, smack bang in the middle of a fractal map, between them they had some 40 odd warriors, chariots, archers and catapults, jammed up blocking the entire area, no one had set up a city there for the entire game, as no faction could even get there.City states are much better in this version, though the devs need to patch in an option to lower their number (or set to zero). Personally i did not mind the city states, as long as i could set the number low.Too many (as it is now) clogs up the map, eats up space for cities and because of their bonuses they get alot of units.They even create settlers for some reason.Overall, i would not recommend at this current stage at this price point.However it is worth picking up if on a sale, but i would suggest you wait for more patches and a sale before buying.Get the ""yet not another map pack mod"" if you do purchase, as it gives you alot more options and Europe/Earth/ect maps.Also: Custom faction and city names are not in the game currently, this should be added in the next patch as a must!"
107,17.4,Not Recommended," November 7, 2016",348,"This review is for the single-player game only.TL;DR This game has left me with a distasteful feeling of being cheated and robbed. This game is a micromanagement chore. Not strategy.The maps are too crowded. The units have no place to move around. I feel like a traffic constable trying to clear a rush-hour traffic, particularly from mid-game. One unit per tile, with AI non-military units blocking user military paths is a glaring flaw. The AI missionaries spammed all over the map do not help.The UI is a disaster. It is unintuitive, and indecisive. Finding resources on the map is a tedious task, with inadequate filters on the map. The camera keeps resetting to units of its choosing after every action I take, giving me a headache.The AI is incredibly hostile and illogical (stupid?), always cooking up wars. I felt like I was in a sorority house trying to win a date to the prom. Trying to understand the AI's motives involves digging deeper than into Facebook's privacy settings. They might as well have just used excel sheets as UI.The gameplay is not fun. The pestilent barbarians force you to grow militarily. The technology tree is pre-destined by giving away eureka points for specific actions. Choice has been curtailed for such gimmicks.All these elements come together in a deleterious way, forcing you to play a tactical, reactive game than a strategic, proactive game. This game is not for rulers, it's for bureaucrats. No real choice, just an illusion. This game is one sequel away from being turned into a pay-to-win freemium mobile and console app.Yes, this game could be something great, but why should one pay for just a possibility?"
4,259.0,Not Recommended," November 26, 2016",386,"Honest impressions by a seasoned player after many hours of CIV VICon’s: - First, developers did not listen to the community: from the many wishes and comments, and the actual mods that were created by the community in CIV V, it should have been obvious to the developers what people want. It is an immense luxury for a software company, let alone a game developer, to have an actual community of fans and die-hard players. Unfortunately they did not read the forums and put all the wishes into the new version VI. Below some comments of my own. - Look-and-feel: cartoonish. Stupid green all over the place, even hills are green. Units and leaders look like from a cartoon movie. CIV V was about ‘serious’ gameplay, more realistic as a copy of the real world. The total cartoon look of VI makes the game look for children, instead of a ‘simulation of world history’. And the loook-and-feel is not tweakable in the settings. - Immensely irritating barbarians: barbarians are the strongest civilization now. Their camps pop up all the time and all over the place! A peaceful beginning with building cities and improving tiles is completely out of the question: you are swarmed by barbarians all the time. This is something like the ‘raging barbarians’ setting in CIV V, but now it’s standard. Very very annoying and no fun at all. You must use up all your production for military units. Also, the barbarians are way too strong to be any fun. And they keep going right into the information era, they never stop appearing. Not a balanced gameplay this way. Barbarians should become weaker in advancing eras, and stop appearing altogether entering the modern era. - No good maps: there are only maps that throw all civilizations together in one spot. And they all go to war with you all the time. This makes everything in the game going against you all the time. Not balanced. No fun. Very stupid that there is no earth map. Let alone a large earth map. Or a map that gives you an ‘earth-like’ layout of landmasses. Those maps offer space, exploration, distance betweek civilizations and a realistic feel. - Absence of real good advanced settings: there are no advanced settings available, that let you tweak your game and starting settings. The community was fond of the ingame editor. Developers should have been awake, and provide something similar from the outset. Not to cheat, not so extensive as the IGE, but provide options to start a game according to your preferences in the world, preferred map location and so on. - PC hardware specs: this game is very memory and cpu consuming. It is impossible to run on current hardware but only in the lowest quality setting. Why must a game force a player to buy a whole new computer? - Spreading cities into districts: personally, I don’t see any advantage in this. Growth of cities (more tiles are acquired) is slow anyhow, so districts take up space in tiles that otherwise would be turned into farms, mines etc. The same goes for wonders. They appear on their own tile now. I fail to see the usefulness or the fun of it. - Computer opponents are idiots: the artifical intelligence of the opposing civs is just as bad as in CIV V. They are imbeciles. CIV is a game, of course. It is not a real simulation of history, true. But still, right there is the fun of it: that is why it is called ‘civilization’. But when I go to higher levels of difficulties, I want more intelligent play from the AI opponents, not that they totally unrealistically get more production, more units, more of everything than you do, and you get minus everything. That is not realistic. The game should go for intelligent exploration, tile improvement, culture victory etc. instead. Like in chess game software. - Diplomacy is non-existent: For all these reasons in the previous point, diplomacy is still complete nonsense in version VI. You ‘buy’ favors with trading or with gold. That is not diplomacy. Diplomacy is to actually form alliances, that are long and true, or that let you do interesting things together. Unlike CIV V you can no longer agree upon common projects, trade prohibitions or form United Nations. Diplomacy is still no element of the game. It was even better in CIV V. It is even better in Beyond Earth: there you can use spies to really steal goodies, damage an opponent or even start a revolution and obtain an enemy city! Those things should have been in CIV VI. They should have added a Trojan Horse unit for example, to take an enemey city by surprise. Creating intelligence agencies and spy rings is unfortunately not possible. - Time-line is not good: many gamers commented on the fact that in CIV V everything that matters happens in the classical, medieval and renaissance eras. The game only plays and ends for a few turns in the modern or information era. Whereas those eras are the most interesting! The developers did not listen to the community. Still, in CIV VI you are only a few turns in the information era and then the game is over. This should be more balanced: more time in the ultimate eras. And provide more interesting things in the modern and information era. Put in satellites. Military satellites, communication satellites, satellites that alter the gameplay, such as in Beyond Earth. A missed opportunity. Pro’s:- some interesting new civilizations- good narrator, Sean Bean- that’s about it, sadly High hopes:- activation of the Steam workshop and mods, mods, mods- someone of the developers reading my entry here So... and now back to my game of Civilization V."
138,55.2,Not Recommended," October 21, 2016",386,"tl;dr: Good game, Bad AI. Playing a mechanically sound strategy game with inept opponents isn't very fun. When devs / modders fix the AI it'll be amazing. Until then, it's merely 'ok'.It has A LOT to like: city building, general improvments to how things make much more sense (Trade caravans build roads, techs get boosts for relevant activity, city planning), art style of the map (though leaders have really long faces), combat animations, tech / culture trees, unit progression compared to civ5, etc etc.;;However, while the game is a joy to play in a mechanical sense, it's lacking in two things that are kind of a big deal -- the diplomacy, and the AI.The long-hyped 'agendas' for the AI are honestly not doing anything. The AI is still insane -- declaring war on you with 7 warriors in ancient era and then wandering around getting picked off by archers for a bit before begging for peace. It's literally the same level of useless as Civ 5 on release, if not worse.The sad part is that giving the AI huge bonuses on higher difficulties doesn't really make the game more 'challenging', it just makes it more annoying. This might be my opinion but not being able to complete a single wonder and being PHYSICALLY unable to race with 500% (or w/e high bonuses AI gets) more science / culture / faith / gold on deity isn't my idea of fun. And the saddest part of it all is because the AI is so inept they'll still somehow lose to you in wars, with three times your numbers and straight up stronger units.Game balance is basically alright, with a few outliers. They've made warrior line have bonus vs spear line. That's good. Crossbowmen turn into Field Cannons that don't have 1 range like the freaking Gatling Gun -- that's very good! The new government system with cards is good; However, each individual card is so weak that basically all civs that have bonuses to government policy slots are really, really weak. To a point where Greece is downright useless as 1 policy slot + hoplites (that take extra damage from base warriors) just make it worse than rome in every way. Yeah, the 40 power legions are back with a vengeance, which makes me happy as a civ veteran, though I can imagine how it can be annoying for someone who starts near rome.But all that doesn't really matter past 100 turns because for some reason in 80% of cases the AI just refuses to upgrade units. I get it, bows and chariots are cool, but it's 1952 and I do think it's not that hard to invest in some muskets! OR EVEN SWORDS!The AI also doesn't seem to understand trade. Example: it offers me 52 gold for a resource, I click the gold away, then add the same exact amount they offered in the first place, and they refuse. Sometimes they ask for 2 resources and 200 gold for open borders; Sometimes they're winning war and peace out offering everything they have. I don't think it should do those things!All in all, not a bad civ game, with a lot to like, but just like Civ 5 it'll probably require a lot of patching and an expansion or two THAT WILL HOPEFULLY FIX THE AI to be fully enjoyable for me. It's not a bad game. It's playable. But jeez, how hard is it to just make GOOD ai again? You did it for civ3 and civ4, Firaxis. Civ5 and 6 are both easier games AND have worse AI. It just annoys me to no end =/Edit: Re-shuffled some thoughts, and added a few words on :It's basically the same as civ 5, maybe a LITTLE bit better. Played with 1 person on a standard size map, the first 100 turns were flawless, then the random desyncs begun. I suggest playing on small maps as I don't think there have been much improvments under the hood to remedy civ5's problems. At least it reconnected my friend every time through ~15 desyncs in ~50 turns. But that's really not an acceptable number for a triple A game that had the exact same problems in the previous installment.Upd: Desyncs fixed by saving and re-hosting the game, as it turns out.

Some people are complaining that it's simpler but I don't think that is a bad thing. A lot of overhead removed and the new builders I like better than the old workers. Limited uses is better than late game having 100 random extra units everywhere. Trade routes auto building roads is just another QoL improvement but people are complaining about their skillcap. On that note, you can still manually build roads later in the game so nothing has changed besides improving the trader unit. Graphics style is great to some people while others prefer the old style. I personally like the new one and the interface is definitely improved.I am sure there will be some things later that I notice or miss about an old version but right now, if you are a Civilization fan, I highly recommend."
68,90.3,Not Recommended," June 22, 2017",11,"This game simply isn't very much fun. The diplomatic system is really what makes the game so boring. It gets annoying when AI players get angry at you and break alliances for no reason. In most of my games, a large percentage of the Civs in the game hate me by the middle of the game, even when I've managed to avoid going to war with anyone. That's pretty rare though, as the AI loves to declare war on me as often as it can - even in situations where it is so far away from me that it has nothing to gain. However, when I was playing it regularly the AI failed even in the basic aspects of warfare. Often, I would get attacked by waves of units three or four eras behind my level of tech - the AI would never upgrade its units. For me this really is a singleplayer game, so it has to be interesting to play against the AI; as things stand it's not just that the AI is easily beatable, its that the AI sometimes doesn't understand how to play the game.I'll also note that I don't like the cartoonish new art-style in Civ 6."
159,11.7,Recommended," October 21, 2016",304,"Civilization 6 is the successor of perhaps the finest historical simulation game in, well, history. Not counting Beyond Earth here...Does it live up to its former glory (minus BE)? Definitely!Will you still catch the one more turn syndrome? Of course!Is it worth $60 for the base game? DependsIs it worth $80 for the base game + 4 future DLCs? Yes.Civ 6 takes much of Civ 5 + DLCs and adds several new and fun features to it. Every Civ 5 fan will enjoy this game, once they have adapted to its different art-style. Having said that, the base Civ 6 game still feels slightly lacking compared to Civ 5 + DLCs. But that is because Civ 6 does not have DLCs yet.If you were to compare the base game of Civ 6 to the base game of Civ 5, there is no comparison. Civ 6 is simply on another level of greatness. But as with Civ 5, the upcoming DLCs for Civ 6 will improve the game dramatically (I sincerely hope).Therefore, if you are interested in this game, buy the Deluxe edition, even if you don't plan on playing the game until DLCs are out, as you are getting 4 future DLCs for just $20 more, which does save you some money. The base Civ 6 game might not be as polished as Civ 5 + DLCs, but Civ 6 with its own DLCs will definitely be.Some negatives about Civ 6 compared to Civ 5 (will add more when I get the chance):A lot of customization options are currently missing when setting up your game, such as:-the lack of maps to select from (only 5 + shuffle, compared to Civ 5's dozens).-ability to add/remove City-States from the game.-the map/artstyle will take some time to get used to, especially the fog of war.Overall, recommending in hope that Civ 6 DLCs are as awesome as Civ 5 DLCs!"
72,29.1,Not Recommended," October 25, 2016",448,"NOTE: THIS REVIEW WAS MADE AROUND WHEN CIV VI WAS FIRST RELEASED. IT MAY NO LONGER BE AS ACCURATE AS IT FIRST WAS. TAKE IT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT.Short: At this time, I'd only recommend buying Civ VI if you intend to play primarily with others. The biggest problems revolve around the AI, and multiplayer gameplay is MUCH better than singleplayer. Even then, though, I'd suggest you put some thought into it.If you intend to play primarily singleplayer, just stick to Civ V. It's fun, and suffers none of the issues that Civ VI has to deal with.Long:I'm honestly shocked that I'm writing this.I loved Civ V. I have ~163 hours logged on it. But this...I expected better.Graphics:The graphics are probably the area where Civ VI actually does well. It's clear that a lot of effort was put into making a game that looked very pretty (because it IS very pretty).If only they put as much effort into making the gameplay as high-quality.Soundtrack:I've seen some articles raving about Civ VI's soundtrack. There is NOTHING special about it. It's barely present, and not memorable at all. (The title screen music is the exception to this. THAT is amazing.)As for sound effects, they're nothing special, but they're of acceptable quality.Gameplay:Good:+It has the same deep, complex, addicting strategy gameplay that the Civ franchise is known for.+The new District system adds more planning to city building, and encourages you to build more cities so you can access a wider variety of resources. Planning = Strategery = Better.+The Happiness system from Civ V has been replaced by Amenities. The way it's set up removes almost all of the penalties for building a ton of cities. This means that ""building wide"" is now a MUCH more viable strategy than it was in Civ V.+Citystates are now MUCH fancier. Becoming their best friend now grants you a VERY special bonus unique to that specific citystate (as long as you stay their best friend, at least)+Religion plays a much bigger role. It's not DLC anymore, and they've added a victory method relating to it. Nice to see it getting some much-needed attention.+Culture has gotten an overhaul, it's now needed to unlock government policies (as well as some buildings). The tiny upgrade trees from Civ V have been replaced by a giant research tree comparable to the science one.+Some changes to how unit maintainence and economics work means that maintaining a larger standing army is now feasable without late-game special abilities.Bad:-THE AI, AKA THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH THIS GAME.Oh my goodness, where to begin?I expect some occasional stupidity or unreasonableness from AI in any game. Civ gets more leeway in this regard due to the fact that it's SO. FREAKING. COMPLICATED! (in a good way. I like complex.)However, instead of the mostly-semi-reasonable AI one would expect, we get AI civs with LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE expectations that, if you don't meet, they just go out and declare war on you. Non-stop. No diplomacy of any sort is possible (because they're so unreasonable) and it's HIGHLY doubtful it would help anyways. It's unreasonable, it's not fair (as while the AI civs pretty much always end up hating each other, they barely ever declare war on each other), and most importantly, IT'S NOT FUN.For someone like me who prefers to go for victories besides domination, this is pretty much game-ruining.In addition to this, they also seem to have the ability to create LIMITLESS military and religious units with little to no cost or negative side-effects. Again, unreasonable, unfair, and unfun.The AI is the BIGGEST ISSUE Civ VI has. I am not the only one to hold this opinion, either.If it wasn't an issue, this would be a MUCH more positive review.-Housing. It's an arbitrary limit on how many people you can have, and it exists for LITERALLY. NO. REASON. (realism? who needs that? I want fun gameplay, not realism.) By limiting population, the game forces you to ""build wide"", as it's COMPLETELY IMPOSSIBLE to ""build tall"" (comparable to how in Civ V, the happiness system made ""building wide"" a horrible idea). Housing adds nothing to the gameplay, and does nothing but make certain strategies impossible.-Religion has a few very noticable flaws. My 3 main complaints are:1: The 2 methods of spreading your religion are missionary units, and pressure emanated from cities. This is all well and good, EXCEPT THERE IS NO WAY TO SEE ANY REPRESENTATION OF PRESSURE AT ALL. You're left guessing as to whether you're having an effect or not. Now that religion is so much more important, something like this is MUCH more of a problem.2: It's possible to have your religion wiped out. If all of your cities are converted to a different religion after you've founded your own religion, CONGRATULATIONS! Your religion is dead. This would be a fairly minor thing if it weren't for the fact that the AIs get limitless religious units (as mentioned above), thus giving them a VERY unfair advantage religion-wise. It'd probably be tolerable, if it weren't for...3: Several times, I have had several of my cities stop believing in my religion for no discernable reason whatsoever. No enemy missionaries, no religious pressure of other religions. ABSOLUTE. BULL****.While I like the increased attention Religion has gotten, it has so many flaws that it's not a viable strategy for a player to use.-There's no tutorial for returning Civ players. I don't want a full ""how to play"" session, I just want to know whats different from Civ V.It took me an hour of reading the Civilopedia (the ingame instruction manual) to figure out what I know now, and I STILL don't get all the new stuff.-You can't rename cities. I play a lot of multiplayer, and renaming cities in Civ V was a very big source of laughs amongst my friends and I. It IS a fairly minor complaint, but I HAVE done a little bit of looking into it, and everything I've found suggests that it would be VERY easy to add. Seriously Firaxis, WTH.-They got rid of diplomatic victory. :(Overall:Civ VI is HORRIBLY flawed. The devs need to wake up and fix some of these glaring issues.If you want it for singleplayer, wait for the issues to be fixed. If you NEED singleplayer Civ, go get/play Civ V. It's very similar, it's balanced, and it's fun.If you want it for multiplayer (especially with friends), I would say get it. It's Civ, it's fun, and the biggest issues are much less present in multiplayer."

I know every civs flavours, how to exploit AI, how to most efficiently build cities, pushes and completly crush the AI in every game I play against them (diety obv). This took me over 300 hours to learn, while much of the remaining time i used on mods and scenarios. I follow r/civbattleroyale religiously And I can still boot up civ 5 and have a fun game where I try out mods, do gimmicky strategies or play on unique map types.I feel I have enough experience to talk about the pros and cons of this game after my 50+ hours of gametime.Postives:-The game looks nice. aesthetics can be a big turn off to begin with but you get used to it fast. graphics are beyond art pretty nice.-Districts change up the game and makes you think twice about your city placements.-we have a decent enough list of starting leaders with unique playstyles.-music if d*mn near god-tierNegatives.-It took me 20 hours to learn all about AI and game mechanics, 40 hours to beat diety.-AI is easier to exploit than Civ 5 (how did they even make this happen)-The AI rarely upgrades units and charge me with knights in the modern era-The most aggressive expanders dont gobble up land and AI like in civ 5-Playing tall is near impossible because of how science is not held back by city count and how districts are built-Build times are much higher for units and buildings, which make the game more of a drag (thanks to a drop in %-modifiers and an increase in raw modifiers for prodution)-District hold back gimmicky strategies like building cities on islands and expanding near water-Religious combat is a mess-The AI is super reactionary and can go from friendy to denouncing in mere seconds-Some flavours are f*cking ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Montezuma hates you if you get luxuries he does not have (aka always). Saladin hates you if you follow your own religion intead of his crappy religion, how barbarossa will war you if you accidently complete a city-state mission. etc etc-RELEASE THE MOD TOOLS ALREADYright now, Civ 6 is nothing but an inferior game to Civ 5 in any matter. . Its not like this game has no redeeming features, but its far from worth the pricetag it currently holdes. unless the game drops in price signifigantly or gets a couple of much needed tweaks (included extended mod support because that drives the game)If you're interested in a good Turn-Based strategy geme, just go get Civ 5 complete edition for half the price with tenfolds the content and extensive mod support. If you've played civ 5 and want something new, just go download a total conversion mod for it. I'd even recommend civ 3 and 4 before this despite how poorly they've aged.4(?)/10.

You can get your Fighting jets to fly without researching wheels;It's poorly made, weirdly long (why do I have to scroll horizontally for 3 seconds just to see 4 techs?);Lacks of informations. If it wasn't for my advisor set to ""New to Civ 6"" I wouldn't know I could increase the Food output from my farms by 1 by placing them near each other, though it is specified on the ""Farm"" log on civilopedia;It's too fast!

426,47.9,Recommended," October 23, 2016",8,"Having played a few games including a multiplayer game, I feel I can give a fairly honest review about the latest civilization game:Pros:Feature additions:- Districts add a new level to city management and restrict rampant expansion. You can now build ships even if your city isn't on the coast.- New Civics tree puts a nice new spin on culture and allows you to customize your gameplay differently each and every game.- Roads are now built buy trade routes, cutting out the annoying road-building mechanic of previous Civ games- Builders are now charge-based instead of turn based, allowing you to quickly build tile improvements early on- The changes to great people are welcome and the randomness of each great person itself adds a further element of replayability. Furthermore the uniqueness of each great person (specifically artists/musicians/writers) is highlighted by the works of art they produce- Religion has been expanded upon, adding new units such as apostles which can help you achieve the new Religious Victory (earned by spreading your religion to enough cities)- Number of new features in Diplomacy, such as Casus Beli (war justifications)- Espionage has also been expanded upon; You can now choose what missions your spy goes on, such as sabotaging enemy districts, stealing gold/ techs etc- Promotions for units are more distinct, allowing you to further customize your military- Military units can now be joined together to form a group (2 for a corps, 3 for an army) this saves space but does produce combat penalties- Wonders are now things you really have to consider as they now take up a tile (instead of just being inside the city). This allows everyone to get their hands on wonders, especially as a lot of them are location specific (eg has to be next to a commercial district and a river etc etc)- New mechanics of housing and amenities further increases the importance of city management and again prevents rapid expansion- Eureka moments are a god-send especially for military-based civs (e.g killing a unit with a slinger will boost your understanding of Archery, reducing the number of turns it takes to research). This almost acts as a mini-quest mechanic, though many players will find themselves getting boosts from just normal gameplay.-Multiple leaders per civ; eg Greece has both Gorgo (Sparta) and Pericules (Athens) with different leader bonuses.Game:- The multiplayer servers seems suprisingly stable at launch. In the one multiplayer game I played we only encountered one crash and 2 accounts of de-sync. Multiplayer was fairly easy to start.- Main Menu has been simplified, with a lot of options for gameplay customization and optimization- Music and sound is just as good as ever, though there are occasional sound bugs (e.g the constant wheel noise from siege units)Neutral:- Graphics Overhall; some people will love it, some will hate it. Personally I quite enjoy the cartoony art style. The leaders look human but are more like charactatures. The fog of war is great but some might find it confusing.- War weariness, the mechanic nobody asked for, has returned. On paper war weariness is a good idea, preventing militant civs from just stomping everyone into the dust within 30 turns. However in reality war weariness serves no other purpose as to just cripple your empire anytime you go to war. Although the new Casus Beli do negate some war weariness, many of these are later on in the game and/or can't be applied to your civilization (e.g the enemy civ has to be two tech eras behind you). In multiplayer war weariness is exceptionally broken. If you declare war on someone you'd better end it fast because they can simply turtle out until your entire civilization collapses as they just REFUSE peace making you spiral further and further down until you literally can't win. Then if you do look like you might take them over, all they do is just build some awful city miles away, keeping them in the game and further fuelling your misey. In some cases the DEFENDER gets a ridiculous amount of war weariness- where's the sense in this??? I suspect and HOPE this gets patched soon either officially or with mods.- Optimization; the game runs perfectly find on my pc and I haven't crashed once; however other users on steam are reporting issues both on lower and higher end pcs. Something to keep in mind.- Sean Bean voice over; I personally like it, again some people may not. Although the narration does change as techs have multiple flavor texts, often I just find myself cutting poor sean off as he repeats that we can't go around arresting the thieves guild we'd be here all day YEH I GET IT!Cons:- The big one, and I'm sorry to say, the AI are just as bad as ever, although they have improved in a few areas. They no longer spam awful cities everywhere (though sometimes they do make questionable settlements), they play their characters (e.g norway declares war on you for having a tiny navy) and they do make good decisions when they meet you (e.g send gold, try to be nice). This all goes downhill later on. I find myself CONSISTENTLY declining GOD-AWFUL trade deals for 1 gold. ONE SINGULAR GOLD. The AI have no qualms with asking for multiple luxuries/cities/younameit for ONE GOLD. Yet good luck trying to get anything from them other than open borders as they just downright refuse most requests, insisting they can 'never make this work'. The AI have the same problem in previous Civ games where out of NOWHERE they just declare war on you without reason.I haven't seen the AI use a Casus Beli once. Then they just send a bunch of low-tech troops, lose, then throw in the towel. For some reason the AI seems to shy away from upgrading their units, despite easily having the gold to do so. Heavens forbid if an AI neighbour is going down the religion route as your cities will be BOMBARDED by a never-ending wave of apostles that they somehow pulled out their♥♥♥♥♥♥ Yet if you try and do the same they get riled up and denounce you immediatly. At higher difficulties the AI don't change but do get boosts to certain things, same as in previous games. I'd personally recommend King for most players as Prince is too easy.- Multiple bugs and glitches that, while are to be somewhat expected from a new game, are still nonetheless frustrating to deal with. Save regularly- Governments are the same as usual, if you don't want to go to war then democracy is your only choice.- Barbarians pose more of a challenge. This is good to an extent. However a game I played had two barbarian crossbowmen and two horsemen camp my city TURN 15. FIFTEEN!!!! Considering how your city no longer starts with the bombardment ability, this just consigns the game to an early restart.- Rebellions are absurd. I understand that if my city is a complete DUMP I should have repurcussions. So when I'm in the medieval era and my city spawns some rebellious swordsman, that's totally acceptable. But when I'm in the modern era and my city somehow spawns HELICOPTERS??? what do I actually do here- The game grinds to a halt late game even in small games. Late game the turns take ages HOWEVER oddly enough this only happens every so often and not every game. I don't know why my game with 6 players on a standard map lagged but my game in a huge map with 12 players didn't.- randomness of great people sometimes leads to just worthless units. If I get a scientist who gives me a science boost for every mountain nearby, and I have no mountains anywhere, I've essentially just wasted a great person.- Civ placement seems a bit off in some games. On a HUGE map with only 6 players I somehow started right next to 4 of them.Is the game worth it at launch? I think so. It is still a fun game. I'm excited to see what dlcs will bring as the game feels complete as it is. Mod support is also something to look forward to. However, AI still awful and there are bugs."
407,75.6,Not Recommended," March 16, 2017",84,"So, obviously before i begin i should mention the the dlc's for this game are ridiculous and that i feel a little ripped off for paying the extra 20$ to get the first 4 expansion packs. Regardless of the money its the gameplay that makes or breaks a game so lets get into that. So, is this game worth your money? Short answer, no, Not in its current state. The Ai on anything less than emporer is downright laughable, they will declare war for silly reasons like you having luxury resources they do not, or a smaller navy. I wouldnt necessarily be apposed to this, if they actually did anything with their wars, obviously their tactics leave a little to be desired, but, not only are they unable to capture city's without a significant tech lead on you, they will often lose 2-3 city's in their wars, that THEY declared, they seemingly dont prepare at all, and then YOU will be labeled as the warmonger because they are terrible at wars THEY declared.

The differences in the tech trees and civic trees are different enough to be interesting, but not different enough to make me want to re-learn a whole new system. That, and the ""round vs. truncate"" movement system change makes moving units seem painfully slow.I approached the more cartoony-style of design with caution, and it feels like that just takes away from the immersion of the game that you're taking one city from scratch and turning it into the civ that conquers the world. The art of the map is a nice touch, but from a tactical standpoint it's very difficult to look at the world map and tell what's land, water, undiscovered, etc.I so wanted this to be an improvement over Beyond Earth, but it feel like the series has only taken a baby step since then.In the end, Civ 6 makes me want to do nothing more than play Civ 5 more.

It should be noted that the best I have a slow computer (but I hope to upgrade in in three years when I go to college; wish me luck).

Wars that the AI agrees to attack you with another AI depsite having good relations with you. The AI flip flopping with regards to agendas.The flaws are so obvious yet play testing picked up nothing.EDIT: For those commenting, I've been playing on King difficulty. The AI isn't a challenge per se, I am ususually in top 2 or 3 score wise in a large game by late classical/early medieval, It just completely makes no sense."
211,47.4,Not Recommended," October 27, 2016",54,"An ocean wide but a puddle deep.There's only one word to describe this game, broken. Not only does it crash ALL the time but it crashes at the worst of times, just as I'm about to win a domination victory for example, the game crashes just before I win the game. but the crashes are not what make this game uniquely bad.I could list hundreds of individual reasons as to why this is a bad game but the main and most important reason is game balance. Absolutely no thought or dare I say effort has gone into balancing this game, it's about as balanced as a clown on whiskey after an all night bachelorette party. Do I mean the game is too hard? I wish. No the game is too easy because the AI is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and the broken game mechanics allow you to cheese the game in ways you couldn't even dream of in a civilization game. For example there is no downsides to having too many cities in your empire, you can literally spam or conquer as many cities as you like and the game will just keep giving you more science and culture. you'll often find yourself steamrolling science and culture so fast that you're in the atomic era before you've even built the most basic buildings like water mills.The AI is mindless. Often they will have horsemen and catapults in the modern era who proceed to throw themselves at your units, killing themselves. The same goes for diplomacy. If you want an idea of what diplomacy is like in this game then let me give you this as an example, I once got denounced by france 3 turns after meeting them because I WASN'T spying on them. The AI will constantly freeze the game to ask you for all your luxury resources in exchange for nothing while denouncing you for every irrational thing you can think of. You'd have more luck engaging in diplomacy with a Walker from The Walking Dead than you would have with the AI in this game.Something else to keep in mind, the game is as non intuitive as a game can possibly get. You can't automate builders in this game which means if you want all your worked tiles improved you have to manually spawn or create a builder and improve them all yourself. and considering in this game you're going to have at least 30 cities(50 is a more reasonable number) that means you constantly have to go through a bunch of menus for every god damn city to check which tiles need improving. In fact unlike civ 5 all important info requires going through a bunch of menus wheras in civ 5 you could just click on a city and it gives you all you need. Don't worry though through city spam you won't need tile improvements or EVEN BUILDINGS. Just by spamming cities you have enough science and culture to go over 2 eras ahead of all the ais even on the highest difficulty.Wonders are worthless. Remember in civilization 5 how completing a wonder was a big deal and had a huge impact on the game? Here wonders aren't even worth bothering with. Since the key to winning civilization 6 is to just keep getting more and more cities, wonders become completely pointless as they take too long to build and often give you small worthless bonuses. One time I built a wonder for the hell of it on a city with fairly high production and by the time it was finished I had already advanced an entire era ahead. The game advances so quickly that building a wonder is a pointless act. A settler gives you more bonuses than a wonder and that is just pathetic. Why spend 80 turns building the eiffel tower when I can build a settler in 5?This IS NOT civ 5. In fact I don't think the people who designed this game understand even the most basic aspects of a civilization game. Nothing works the way it's supposed to in Civ 6. Diplomacy is broken, the game mechanics are broken and it's tedious as hell to manage your cities. There's only one way to play Civ 6 and that is to spam units and settlers and nothing else. That's not a joke or an exaggeration. There's also religion if you can be bothered with it the AI is too stupid to stop you from winning a religious victory apart from occasionally attacking your religious units with their own if they get too close. You can literally have your apostles idle on a religious site and the enemy apostles will just suicide at you.How this game got pushed out to release in this state is beyond me. Nothing works and the game is broken and unbalanced. I keep seeing all these reviews from people who have only played a few mere hours, even I'm guilty of thinking this was a good game within the first few hours. But the truth is this is an unacceptable level of quality and I expected so much more from Firaxis. I haven't seen a single games journalist have a deep look at the mechanics of this game outside messing around for a few hours.If you do not listen to my review you're going to see the cracks in this game eventually. They really have some nerve to charge so much money for this crap because they know that fans of the series will pay for it. I will think twice before buying a firaxis game in the future."
34,124.6,Recommended," February 3, 2017",18,"Hard to understand some of the negative reviews. No, at the present time, this is not as complete of a game as Civ 5, nor as balanced. It certainly has some issues. BUT this is the biggest single overhaul of the Civ franchise so far. They've introduced a lot of really interesting and innovative concepts that admittedly do need some tweaking, but are not inherently flawed, and in fact really make it a unique and fun product.There are some big cons that need to be addressed, but as I will get to, all of the negatives are fixable problems. The core gameplay is as good as any version of Civ, and will only be built upon.Now let's get to the breakdown.PROS+ The district system is excellent and makes you think a lot more about how you want every city to play out+ The concept of builders really removes the tedium of worker management that has plagued every other version of Civ+ NO GLOBAL HAPPINESS. The worst concept of Civ 5 has been thrown out the window in place of a localized amenity (happiness) system, and for the better.+ The return of large empires. A lot of people seem to see the fact that you're encouraged to expand more as a negative, but to me it's definitely a positive. You now feel like you're building large, sprawling EMPIRES, but it's not just settler spam everywhere. That said, victory paths for building tall are still available for those who wish to play that way.+ The graphics are absolutely gorgeous. Yeah, I know people miss the realistic graphics of Civ 5, but I find the graphical style of 6 to be far more aesthetically pleasing. I love the colors and the way the maps look.+ Better-designed maps. Movement across maps feels more natural and the maps just feel less crowded.+ City-states are better. In 5, you could get by without significant city-state diplomacy unless you were going for a diplomatic victory, but they feel like a much more important and impactful part of the game now. Suzerain bonuses were an excellent addition.+ Early game pacing also feels better than in 5+ The religious victory is a great addition, and religion in general just builds off of what 5 gave us and turns it into a more dynamic, impactful feature. The most fun games I've had have usually focused on religion.+ Tech tree specialization encourages different play-styles and advancement paths. Splitting of tech tree into science and civics is a cool idea.+ ""Card-style"" civics system to replace social policies is great for adjusting play style to current conditions.+ Love the idea of leader agendas, although there will be more about this in the ""cons"" section.+ Spies are so much more useful and flexible than in 5.+ Can combine units into corps and armies in mid/late game, which is excellent for unit management.+ Combination of civics cards, tech tree branching, and district usage encourages alternative play-styles and long-term strategic thinking to a greater extent than in any previous version.+ Most importantly, it still has that great ""just 1 more turn"" Civ feel.CONS- Diplomacy has been nerfed. Aside from luxury trading and war, there's not much reason to contact the AI. Deals often feel imbalanced as well (although the 2 patches so far have helped somewhat). There's no World Congress or diplomatic victory in general, which makes the late game feel a bit empty.- Diplomacy is especially bad when it comes to the ""leader agendas"". It's impossible for every civ to like you because I think the diplomatic bonuses/penalties are too weighted towards agendas. The AI denounces you far too often. In 5, when you were denounced, it was a big deal. In 6, being denounced just happens all the time. This is made worse by the overly long diplomatic animations (the animations themselves are great, but they're too intrusive).- AI is mostly incompetent when it comes to warfare, especially when it comes to taking cities. They're too passive, cannot use siege/ranged units effectively, and don't upgrade their units often enough.- The pacing of the late game doesn't feel right. You blow through the tech tree too quickly, and production times just get too long in the late game. It's possible to advance far along on either the civics or science tree while leaving the other behind, and there's far greater tech disparities between civs than ever existed in previous versions. I often finish the tech tree before properly utilizing late game units.- Tech tree is TOO branchy. There's too many dead end techs, and some missing prerequisites that allow advancement along certain tech paths to be too OP/simply not make sense.- Missing a few key notifications (such as a notification for city bombardment) and some of the UI feels incomplete or cluttered (city screens need an overhaul, for example, and trade routes really need to be sortable).- NO TEAM GAMES. Come on Firaxis, what are you doing here? This is one of those things that feels generally inexcusable.- No Workshop support yet (not a huge deal for me personally at the moment, but something that is definitely vital for the community).That may seem like a long list of cons, but the thing about the cons is that they're ALL FIXABLE PROBLEMS. Firaxis has created an excellent base game, and a wonderful set of features that gives 6 the potential to be a very deep, consistently compelling game. I have faith that they can fix the AI to at least reach an enjoyably competent level, and that further patches and eventual expansions will add additional diplomatic options. Some big-time balancing is needed in the late game especially, but again, that's a fixable problem. People want to compare it to Civ 5 with all of its patches and expansions. Honestly, 6 is a more complete game than 5 was on initial launch, and I remember people complaining about a lot of the same things.I have no problem with any of the base features of the game. The cons all have to do with the AI, diplomacy, and balance that I have faith will be sorted out with time!Currently would give an 8.5/10, but there's the potential for a 10/10 game here. Still would recommend, ESPECIALLY if you aren't going to compare every feature to the complete edition of Civ 5."
354,69.1,Not Recommended," October 21, 2016",41,"I cannot in good conscience reccomend this game in it's current state.+ The game has a lot of cool systems that are fun to explore- The systems are VERY poorly balanced. Your cities produce FAR too little production to pay for the incredibly expensive districts, and the improvements to production come in the form of +1 here and +1 there. Not nearly enough.- There are a number of bugs I've run into that ruined my plans- Missionaries of neutral parties block ALL military units when they walk through a warzone. SERIOUSLY? How are religious units not on their own stacking limit separate from military units? An english missionary wanders into the only road over a river which stops my entire advance for two turns, then another one comes and does it again 4 turns later!- The interface and tooltips are missing a lot of information. Some information just appears to be blatently wrong, while others are either nonexistant or incomplete.- No queue for buildings, really?- AI is at least as bad as Civ V AI, and might even be worse (I watched an AI settler wander in circles for dozens of turns despite being 4-6 tiles away from 2 different prime city locations...on emperor difficulty!)If they provide robust modding capabilities it might be salvagable, but I don't think I trust firaxis to fix these problems. They'll make a half-hearted effort and call it done like always, and rely on the modding community to make it playable by anyone other than the most casual players."
72,78.1,Not Recommended, January 5,114,"At this point in the development of the Civ6 game, I would recommend for those interested in this type of game to purchase Civ5 instead. The basic mechanics of this version need some serious work, in essence it plays you - you do not play it.Don't get me wrong, there are several things that Civ6 improves upon over Civ5 but many of the great features of Civ5 have been lost or thrown out for whatever reason. These can truely make the game extremely tedious (at best) and utterly frustrating if you are already familar with the mechanics of Civ5 already.Pros of Civ6 over Civ5:+Better political game play - definitly a large improvement in working with AI players, better information available on how to play/trade with the AI leaders. Not perfect by any means but an improvement none the less.+Slightly better graphics - I really did not need better graphics or additional animations from Civ5, but I can appreciate that Civ6 did make some improvements in these areas.Cons of Civ6 over Civ5:-Failures of Available Information. Two simple examples: 1-the trade route menu & 2-the help menu. In Civ5, if you wanted to find out what was the best trade route to use next, then you would click on the trade menu and a nice graphic matrix would pop-up and allow you to sort it by all of the different information columns, typically in 3 or 4 clicks I could sort it out in a minute and be on my way. Alternately in Civ6, you have a single long list - no sorting, lots of repeats - it really is an information cluster-f***. To be fair, it looks like there are buttons that should be available for some simple sorting but they don't work (at least in my game) and even if they did, this still would not fufill even 1/2 of the possible options of play. Sometimes when I click on the trade-route menu, nothing shows up at all - so maybe its a bug of some sort, IDK.The help menu: in Civ5, if there is something in the game you can find it in the help menu - may take a bit, but for the most part it is there. In Civ6 there is a lot of information missing - if you don't have access to the internet, forget about it - you may have to save the game and just try it. But you should be prepared to go back 10 to 15 turns to undo that attempt at learning.There is just a lot more information available in Civ5 about what your cities and units are doing or costing you, information that you can use to adjust your gameplay and make improvements.Which leads me to my last major Con: Time to complete. It takes forever to accomplish simple things - This is partially just how the game is but it really seems to me that it is easier to speed things up in Civ5 with the right resources and build options then it is in Civ6.Some other thoughts on Civ6 deficiencies -One of the new items in Civ6 is the ""stackable"" units - they sell this as the ability to create armies, you know, a whole army: infantry, machine gunners, tanks & artillary. Nope. It's not that - It is just a slightly more powerful unit of the same type. Of course, you can't easily determine if this is actually an improvement or not - what is the cost benefit? Can't tell, there is no information available to determine the cost of a 'corps' vs. a 'unit'. But now you have only a shot from that corps instead of two shots from two units.The Districts. The new concept of building districts around your city instead of buildings in your city is interesting but currently flawed. The failure to provide additional workable tiles around the city (still stuck at 3 tile radius) really makes this difficult in many situations. Especially if you are working with a captured city from an AI player. The AI cities do not play under the same rules, which is fine - until you capture one and have to work with what they left you. At least in Civ5 you could build a settler and then raze the AI city at a later time. That is not an option now. You can choose to raze a city only if you capture it by force, and only at that exact moment.Also, you cannot move districts. Pick the wrong spot and did not figure it out until later in the game? Tough cookies - your stuck with it now. Want to trade a district from one city to another that the AI built to close? Nope, can't do that silly - why would you want to do that?City-State Envoys - great concept. Why do they have to all die when an AI player takes over the city-state? Taking with them thousands of years of effort also? Not sure - not happy about it either.Some other thoughts on the Civ game, in general:Why can I not buy and sell land? This seems like a perfectly reasonable way to negoiate with neighbors and make sure that we can actually get along? The land tiles are the most important aspect of the game - why is the concept of trading land rights so foreign & unincluded in these games?Also, why do I need a city to hold on to captured land? I need a city to work the land obviously, but if I capture a city and raze it to the ground, why do I have to give up the land rights? I only need an army to hold on to land, not a city.Anyway - buy Civ5 at a sale event. Wait a few years for Civ6 to fix itself.Myself, I am going to learn how to Mod Civ5 with the good parts of Civ6 and then play Civ5."
127,223.6,Recommended," October 22, 2016",191,"9/10After 20 hours of play I can easily say this is the best Civ ON RELEASE.Easily a 9/10, there is a lot more strategic depth and player options than there were in vanilla Civ 5.Is Civ 6 perfect? No, there are definitely a few tweaks needed, especially to the AI which does some silly things and gets annoying bonuses (King+ difficulty) which I am really not a fan of. There are few strange UI design choices (overall pretty good though, mostly clear and consice). And diplomacy victory which is something I quite enjoyed has been removed. :/Saying that, for every small problem I have there are 3 or 4 great changes (great people system, government types and policies, tweaks to combat and movement, housing and amenities in individual cities .etc.etc.). I LOVE the changes to districts and wonders, it makes terrain and planning extremely important. There's a lot of changes which can't be summed up in this small review however.Unlike CIv 5 and Civ 4 I dont think 2 major expansions are needed before a buy, this is already a great game worth your money and after after some patching and tweaks to the AI and UI (and hopefully an awesome expansion to add diplomactic victory back!) this will easily be the best Civ to date."
184,137.9,Not Recommended," December 27, 2016",10,"Beautiful visuals, the music is great, some of the mechanics changed over from V are neat and add a new twist to the game, but the AI and Diplomacy is so horribly broken it is almost pointless to even attempt to ""make friends"" since they will denounce you for no discernible reason 3 turns later. Countless cycles of war between the AI and also having war declared on you, though hostile units will come to your borders and just chill for the most part before someone decides peace is a good idea. But god forbid you try to start a war because well then you're just a warmonger and everyone that didn't denounce you before is going to immediately after. Pretty much everything in regards to what the AI do and how they play is simply broken."
233,167.9,Not Recommended," December 20, 2016",10,"Civilization offers what a Civ game is known for. An excellent expansive game which allows you to manage every aspect of your empire as you grow across the globe, flourish in the arts and the sciences and ultimately rule the world through either an iron fist, scientific endeavors and worldwide cultural influences.Civilization VI doesn't quite do that.Civ V pulled the same stunt. When it was released, the base vanilla game was mediocre and lacked the mechanics the Civ IV game had which really made it unique. I do expect Civ VI will have it's time to shine as the last two have (baring Beyond Earth) and better implement itself. Many of those mechanics ARE present in Civ VI but the game feels like it want's to do more, but certain bits and pieces are present. It's difficult to pin down, but for seasoned Civilization players who've played every Civ game preceding this one, you can feel there is something not quite right in the sixth installment.Now don't get me wrong here, I enjoy the game quite a bit. I've invested a fair amount of time into it and I do feel the AI has improved a small amount in every way except for combat, which I feel the Civilization AI must be notorious for being about as strategic as a wet carrot pinned to a semi's bumper. But has improved in sometimes being able to properly keep up and out do you in terms of science and culture. The districts which can expand the cities to massive proportions late game make it so you don't have these single tiled cities that have wonders pouring out of their citizens ears and every improvement available. Building your city is a better and proper challenge now and for the most part feels solid. Combat feels about the same as Civ V, being able to build an army feels a bit simpler and the amount of various buffs/de-buffs available when it comes to terrain is better thought out.Performance wise, the game runs pretty good. I recommend killing anti-aliasing, otherwise the game runs as a steady 60fps on my machine. The game looks beautiful with a decent art style choice that is somewhat cartoonish in terms of how Civ leaders look, but it manages to not come across as childish cartoons and more like caricatures with over defined features. I'll drop my pc's specs at the bottom of the review for comparison.Now here's the hard part for me and I really hate to say it right now, but go and play Civilization V. You can get the base game plus the expansions and all the extra content for just under $50(USD) and you'll have a much better experience. Civ VI isn't bad, far from it, but in terms of a Civilization experience, I can't recommend Civ VI. By the way, ignore hours played on my profile for Civ V and IV. Played much of those games well before I had Steam.I can't recommend Civ VI while the previous title is still a better experience.Pros:-Still a great massive turn based game-Friendly toward newcomers and familar to any who have played previous titles-Doesn't demand much of your pc in terms of graphics-Some mechanics feel a little polished-You can speed up research and civics by completing certain prerequisites in gameCons:-Game feels to be lacking some content, but nothing game breaking-The in game UI can become very cluttered late game, especially during war time-CPU starts chugging late game, especially if all AI opponents are still active, causes single turns to take up to two minutes in some cases just to process the AI-AI is still incredibly dumb in terms of combat-AI needs to be tweaked in terms of war declarations.

Its a smooth experience and its a solid release version with a couple of issues and bugs and some major gamedesign pain like spies. However if you tend to be the player that needs a PERFECT Game stay away. If you take a more relaxt stance its already nicely playable, fun and a good timekiller.Edit : 18.12.2016 ---After the patch the game got a lot more enjoyable. Yet the AI still is a piece of rotten garbage. It takes a little longer to steamroll it now, but if you really know what you are doing, it doesnt even matter too much. However for a casual approach to the game it should be some decent time killer now. Still the AI does not yet know what to do with its troops, it just doesnt.And thank god Civ is not one of those games where the trailer at the end matters... it is utterly utterly dissappointing.Oh yeah and spies are still a horrible mechanic, but you dont have to give them the same order over and over and over...any more.

260,143.3,Not Recommended," December 2, 2017",10,"Product received for freeI've forgotten I had this game until the recent announcement of the expansion. I got back into it again, with the hopes that the AI has been patched. Nope, the enemy AI is still an insane schizoprhenic mess at worst, or a petulant child at best.Someone correct me if I'm wrong but the AI acted more logically in 4. I know it wasn't great in CIV 5 but this is just markedly worse. Ever since 5, the AI was basically trying to win rather than acting like a logical person. This sounds great as far as a game goes but when you stop and think about it, the AI behaves in a manner that's insane in real world context. The game's meant to be an abstraction of realistic interaction with other world leaders as your'e trying to run a nation but instead it's too gamified. As can be seen by my playtime, I was bored and uninterested or otherwise just frustrated at the insane AI. The AI does not like you doing anything that helps you win. Which translates to the AI always being hostile unless you give them insane amounts of diplomatic concessions. Too far ahead in science? DENOUNCED!!! Building expansions? DENOUNCED!!! Fighting back when we ganged up on you and declared war? DENOUNCED!!! DENOUNCED!! DENOUNCED!! *rolls around on the floor while foaming at the mouth* (Just imagine VIctoria saying that repeatedly like a 3 year old, cuz that's how it comes across to me).A lot of the game systems still needs tweaking and considering it's been a year at least, it's not promising. You still get units running in place after an attack (unless you turn off animations) which is a bug that was out during release. I'm definitely wary of the expansion despite the promise of improved diplomacy.Then there's the city states and barbarians. Best part was when I was fighting a defensive war against France, there's a couple of neutral city states along the way that decided to unit spam my route for no reason aside from just blocking my passage. I want to believe that it's a coincidence but it's hard to think that considering the barbarians also prioritize targetting the player's units over neutral or rival civ units.TL:DR: Game is fine if you look at it in the context of a game (ie: monopoly is not a good representation of how to run a business but is fun if you play it for what it is) If you play it because you want to pretend you're running a country, stay the hell away."
44,28.5,Not Recommended," November 4, 2016",105,"I played few games, and I have to say, I'm a bit disappointed. After only three games, I was starting to get bored with this game. There are some good changes made to it, and it seems more complex, at least when comparing to Civ V, but something just seems to be missing.Pros:- The science-kind of Civic-tree is nice, where you use culture to ""research"" causes, which give you these cards, that have different kinds of bonuses and perks. The new government system connected to this, in which you get to choose your government from classical republic to fascism and communism, is a neat feature.- Districts. These are a new feature, that instead of building every building inside your city center, you choose a tile where you build a certain district, like campus or market. This is good, because it makes the cities look more realistic and good-looking. It gives the cities the feeling, that a city in reality is more than just the city center. It's also about it's surrounding towns and suburbs.- Graphics style is a bit two-bladed sword: other like it, others don't. I like the new fog of war, where instead of the usual fog or clouds, the map actually looks like an old map. Otherwise, though, I don't like the graphics that much, the cartoony style doesn't just fit, especially the leaders, and the actual map is kind of bland: all civs look alike and the units look all the same. Diversity is missing here.Cons:- Pretty much everything else. The game still feels like the old Civilization V with some good features taken out. There's no diplomatic victory, no UN, no World Congress. Cultural victory is laughably easy. City-States don't seem to matter at all. After 200 turns there just doesn't seem to be anything left to do, other than press for next turn, and hope you have done the required things for your favored victory, as in the end, it's just about turns, and who started doing it first.- Barbarians are made more aggressive and hard, and in most cases, too much. At only 10 turns the barbarians are already attacking with horsemen against your warriors and slingshots. And new barbarians seem to spawn almost like every turn. The first minutes of the game is just about fighting the barbarians and you have to focus your science and civics to military, just to get by. And sometimes the computer players are stupid enough to lose to barbarians right at the start of the game.- Which leads to the stupid AI. They have no logic and seem to be denouncing you all the time with no apparent reason. In one game, I had good relations with one city-state. Then, a random player started a war against it, then suddenly all the other computer players denounced me for being a warmongerer - I mean, seriously?Only good things about the AI is trading: you can actually haggle and try different deals, and get somewhere with it, unlike in Civ5. But that's about it. Talk about the civs' agendas, the Norway seems to hate me all the time, just because I can't be bothered to build few ships, and Cleopatra hate me because I have a weaker army (even though sometimes I have even greater than hers). And Peter of Russia seems to first wonder why I have no science and arts, but the next time he idolizes how much I have science and arts, and this goes back and forth the whole game. I just don't get how they coded any of these lines.In short: I think the game feels incomplete and rushed. They just added some cool things and took out other, without ever properly testing the game. Everything sound and seems great and cool at first, but nothing really works actually. Like the warring penalties, that if you suddenly out of no reason start a war, you get penalties, and when you get things that justify a war (like finding a spy), they don't work or affect in any way.Generally, I would not recommend: if you're a true Civ-fanatic, or otherwise love TBS games very much, give it a try once it's on sale. In any other case, I'd recommend to pass on this one.Thanks for reading, and be sure to check more reviews atEDIT: Another minus I have to add - no official mod support or even a map editor! Sad."
24,55.6,Recommended," October 22, 2016",52,"So the main question most people looking at buying this game would ask is whether or not it is better than Civ 5.There really is no simple answer to that question but I think to a large extent the answer is yes, here's why:1. The atmosphere is amazing. At first I thought I would hate the graphics, but since I've been playing they've grown on me (not in a weird fungal way). Yes, they do look less reallistic then Civ 5 (possibly even a little bit cartoonish), but they build an atmosphere for the game in a way that is just as immersive as the realism of Civ 5. The music is great, definitely superior to that of Civ 5 (maybe not as great as Baba Yetu, but then again what is). I also love Sean Bean's voice (no homo).2. The city building is far deeper than that of Civ 5, and more strategic. You actually have to plan out how you will use each tile and where you will build improvements. You can't build every single building you want to in each city, and that forces you to specialize each city.3. The combat is a lot more tactical than in Civ 5. The new movement rules make a large impact on planning out your assaults as well as your defenses. Also bringing back stacking from Civ 4 in a limited way makes you make decisions about where you want to focus your strength. I also love the fact that it takes walls for a city to bombard; it gives you a reason to actually build walls.4. Each civilization is a lot more deep and it feels like each leader has a personality. I know that agendas are getting a lot of flak right now, but I actually really enjoy them. For example, I fought Gorgo to a standstill early on in one game, and after the war ended we actually became friends because she beleived I had fought honorably. It actually felt like she was acting like the historical figure actually would. Now of course the agendas need some tweaking to make the Ai behave normally but overall I like the agendas. Oh and as a side not Civilizations don't have just one bonus now, they actually have several, which makes each civ a bit more detailed and unique.5. The early game can be challenging if you aren't prepared. This especially applies to higher difficulty games, where in the early game you will more than likely have to deal with a neighboring civ or barbarians. You actually have to build units early game in order to protect yourself. Now admittely the ai does need to be fixed so it can attack effectively but I will talk more about that later.6. The eureka and inspiration boosts definitely take each game a different dirrection. The choices you make in game actually effect how your civilization progresses. For example, if you have a very peaceful early game, then chances are you won't be researching stuff like archery or bronze working for a while just because it is easier to go down other routes first. It feels like your experiences in game are actually connected to your technology and culture.7. I also really like how the civics tree functions. The whole card system feels a lot more fluid than the old social policy system that inevitably came down to going tradition and then rationalism. Again, it feels like you are reacting to your game, not the other way around. I also really enjoy the government types and the bonuses each one gives. The governments actually give you an interesting early and mid game in terms of culture and its bonuses.8. I know this is a small thing but I really like the fact that there are actually casus belli now and that warmongering penalties increase throughout the ages.9. Housing should probably go with #2 but I'm kind of lazy so..... I like the realism of being essentialy forced to settle around fresh water. I'm a history nerd so I absolutely love civilizations rising around major waterways like in the neolithic era and there being an emphasis on looking for water sources for new cities.10. The new and expanded victory types are defintiely a welcome addition. It is good to see that there a bigger benefits for focusing on relgion than there were in Civ 5. I'm also grateful that city states now function differently which has also lead to the removal of the diplomatic victory type, as it was just annoying to see other civs having infinite amounts of gold and overwhelming you with it in Civ 5. Also, I feel like the science victory is more meaningful, as it feels like you aren't just building parts for a spaceship but also trying to settle a new planet.The list of great changes for Civ 6 could go on and on but I think I got most of the major ones.Here are the few negative parts of this game that aren't an improvement over Civ 5:1. The Ai can be a bit wonky at times. It has a very hard time attacking cities properly, even with the overwhelming numbers it always has. The Ai can also have trouble upgrading it's units, although often times this is due to a lack of resources for certain units. However, if you are planning on dominating the world in Civ 6, it isn't actually that much easier than in Civ 5 (not that it was that hard on Civ 5), as the Ai will actually build updated units and it usually has a ton of units so it can be difficult and a bit of a meat grinder to get through them all. The Ai will probably be patched up to working condition within a month, so it really isn't that big of a deal.2. The Ui could use some amount of improvement, mainly in the way lists are sorted and making it more clear how your amenities are being used. This is relatively minor and will be a rather easy patch or will just require a mod or two to deal with if you are really that OCD.So in conclusion, while the game isn't perfect, it is already just as, if not more, fun than Civ 5 all while offering a completely different expereince from Civ 5. I see no reason to wait to get the game, as it is already very much a fun and enjoyable experience, even without expansions (which could not be said of Civ 5 on release, despite it now being one of the best strategy games of all time)."
56,33.5,Not Recommended," December 21, 2017",120,"All this game has going for it is the Graphic's, the gameplay is underwhelming and too easy for these reasons:1. Stratigic Resource Management is gone, meaning with only 1 iron deposit you can spam as many swordsmen as you want ( unlike Civ5 where if you had 8 Iron you could produce 8 swordsmen)2. Too much focus on Luxery Resources in combination with the 3 builds on worker's ( meaning 1 city will always be spamming worker's) which slows down the game3. AI has always been bad but is extra bad this time around, Barbarian's are by far the biggest threat the entire game4. No Golden Ages <- Firaxis is trying to push it in a $30+ DLC WTF?5. Too much Focus on Religion in Combo with not being able to attack Missionaries6. Traders buidling Roads sounds like a good idea until Rome smashes you everytime because they are Super OP this time around with getting roads right away7. Cities not properly defending themselves until an encampment district is built ( every city should have a military unit in it at all time's anyway to defend against Barbarian's, but i miss Cities being able to shoot at range like in Civ5)8. Way too easy too boost Tech's ( nothing like being four ages ahead of Diety AI )9. Way too easy overall, upon playing the 1st game realizing it's way too easy, start a new game on Diety as Rome, beat it first time through like a bad joke (have over 600+ hrs in Civ 5 & still have not beaten the game on Diety)Overall if you have never played a Civ game & want to start the Series this is a great game for you, if your a Diehard Civ fan keep playing Civ5 as its way better overall"

While this one is definitely NOT as bad as the outer space one, I think the franchise really jumped the shark after Civ V. (The peak is either Civ 4 or 5.) Added sophistication should never come at the expense of pure fun."
166,35.6,Not Recommended," November 29, 2017",12,"The civ balancing feels completely broken. I'm unsure if the dlc added a good leader outside Gilgamesh, who has a tile improvement that grants 2 science and 1 culture every turn and is available from the start of the game. They are built on rivers, giving a guarentee that you will get 2 food or 2 production from the tile on top of this, making for an all round broken experience when they are spammed. Then we come to the war cart, which is essentially a cavalry unit that is stronger than the unit it replaces, faster and immune to anti-cavalry unit advantages.You'll probably be thinking ""Why not just play without Gilgamesh?"" Every civ apart from Gilgamesh feels incredibly weak. If you read what was just described and compare it any typical civ 5 nation, it is relatively strong, but not broken like it is in civ6. If you play without Gilgamesh, you don't really feel like you will accomplish anything because you will know just how terrible what you are playing is compared to any nation in civ 5. The game is not worth buying when every civ seems to lack specilisation and this leads me to conclude that civ 5 is still a superior game, and a far more enjoyable way to spend your time."

193,297.2,Recommended," October 21, 2016",12,"Updated 9/11/2016So, yet another installment of Sid's Civ franchise, i was hyped, VERY hyped. And I must say, after quite some confusion in the first attempt, I quickly learned, and adapted. This is definitely the best Civ to date, and I say that on release.First of all, the city screen is almost gone, and it annoyed me, untill i realised how simple it could be and still work, it's quite amazing honestly. Everything from the new mechanics to simple cosmetics such as the aqueducts, they actually look and graphically function as such. Warriors.. Saladin got curved sword, America, does not. Headgear changes too. Skincolour fits the civilization, aswell. It feels like a great new milestone for Civ to go for, lots more to do now, yet without more stress, a good eye for where to place things later on is the hardest, no doubt.Second, Bringing back stacked units, Corps and Armys(i believe it was), support units, even more leader choices for , so far, one Civ, Greece, either play as the wise old Pericles(did i get that right?) or as Gorgo, the Queen of Sparta. Theres many more things id like to add but honestly, i want people to experience all the new sweet♥♥♥♥♥♥themselves.All in all, im horrible at writing reviews, but this is simple an all-out amazing game.Pros: Everything except 1 con.Cons: I wish it was easier to find out what tiles benefits from what districts.So, go buy it! You will not regret it, it has a TON of new features that are just amazing, any old Civ player will be pleased.Added: I must also say, the new Great Person system, ALL of it, is simply amazing... Absolutely!Added 2: I see a lot of negative reviews on the AI, but i must say, after many hours in Civ, i learned how not to♥♥♥♥♥♥the AI off, or how to.. you will never please everyone tho. It is just that people dont understand the system, they make a bad review."
16,519.1,Not Recommended," November 3, 2016",131,"I have clocked around 30 hours so far and I really wanted to like the game but to be honest I am struggling a little. It's such a shame because I am a huge fan of the series but I have to say this one is a backwards step from 4 and 5.First of all I shall go over the pros (in my opinion):1. Love the builders; they are an improvement on workers who just became annoying after a while on Civ 4 and 5.2. Love the trading! It has more depth to it than 5, which was a bit easy, and I like that they build automatic roads. A good improvement.3. One of the best improvements for me is the city state interaction. Sending envoys is an interesting and easy way to ally with city states, a big improvement on 5, which, unless you were Greece was pretty hard to maintain relationships with city states.4. I really like the districts and how they work, it makes for a more deep and meaningful game, where city planning is of the utmost importance. Fantastic addition to the game.5. The civics are also a good improvement in my opinion. Having such a diverse government system means there are hundreds of different ways to play the game and now you can really tailor a government to suit the needs of your empire.6. Barbarians are now much more of a challenge and so have more meaning within the game.7. Absolutely love the fact you can create your own religion!That's about it for the pros. There is very little change in the battle systems and how scouting works, which is good because they were fine anyway. Right, now onto the cons, and although there are only two big cons they basically make the game much worse than 4 and 5.1. Map sizes have deteriorated badly! If you do a huge map with 12 civs then you will be on top of each other from the start. I have tested this time and again and I am usually 4-5 squares away from at least two other civs. There is no room for expansion and so wars are rife. It is impossible to play this type of game unless you plan on conquering the civs closest to you, which could easily back fire and means sacrificing religion, science and culture just so you have an army big enough to do the job. The civs will always put a city next to your capital before you have a chance to. Basically if you try and get a settler you'll sacrifice an army and the civ next to you will invade. Gandhi, Roosevelt, doesn't matter. They WILL invade and if you have a small army then you'll be wiped. Therefore the game is pointless being played on a huge map with 12 players, in fact, after much testing and comparing with 5 I believe that the huge map on 6 is roughly that of a medium on 5. If you want to play a similar experience to 5 (e.g. having space to grow your empire) then I'd suggest having six civilizations on a huge map. Any more and it is too congested. It's a great shame because I loved having all of the civilizations involved, not just a few of them. I can only guess that they have done this because of the new graphics engine, which does look good, but I'd have preferred 5 graphics with larger scale maps any day and I think most people would agree.2. The civilizations are mental. By which I mean they will declare war on you for no reason whatsoever, they denounce you for being poor etc. even though you are richer than them, they will build cities next to yours even though it is hundreds of miles away from their capital. Basically the AI is massively flawed and must be tweaked. I have played three full games now and never had an ally. They always dislike me due to one of their agendas clashing with mine. It doesn't really work and just creates war.3. You can no longer choose how many city states to start with!4. After the renaissance era onwards the game slows down so much it becomes hard to play. I have a gaming PC with 32 GB of RAM and yet I am waiting roughly a minute between goes, sometimes longer! Again, this is down to the updated graphics.5. Still have the same issue as on 5 with iron not spawning in the your borders. However, on 5 you could avoid wars by being clever. On this one war will arrive within the first 100 goes EVERY TIME! Therefore army is key. If you have no iron then you will struggle and in my three goes so far I have had just one iron on my continent!It is such a shame that the game has these fatal flaws because otherwise it truly would be the best one of the series. I hope that they iron out these flaws but I am not sure whether they will be able to because increasing map sizes will just slow the game down even more. Therefore if you do get this game then take it for what it is: a war game. The flaws mean that wars happen all the time. In all my games so far there has been nonstop war from the ancient era all the way through. Most civs get wiped out by the renaissance era, normally leaving me and two-three other civs to fight it out the rest of the game. It is the same every time and it is for that reason why I cannot recommend this game to anyone. I will stick with it for a while longer and see if there is improvement but I can't see me playing this as long as I did 5, and I can even see myself going back to 5 sooner rather than later."
49,234.6,Not Recommended," November 13, 2016",133,"I do not recommend this game to players that are new to Civilization games.Things I like;1. I love the art style, very simple and easy to your eye.2. I like the district concept, learning how to optimize your city using district is fun. District will likely make you play again.3. Barbarians are fun to deal with, they are a challenge even though I would prefer more options to deal with them. Like declaring a joint war against them or actually interacting with their leaders (king beyond the wall).4. One more turn urge, early eras are fun.5. Sean Bean doesn't die, at least so far in my game.Things I hate;1. Freaking A.I spamming denouncing button on you, after I finish this review, I am going back in the game to nuke every A.I to teach them some manners. You will get denounced for no reason, you build a military to protect yourself? ♥♥♥♥ you I am denouncing you. You dare bring your units to close my borders even though they are in your terrority ♥♥♥♥ you I am denouncing you.2. Trading with A.I is pointless, I wanted a luxuary resource ""Salt"", and this******* Tomyris of Scythia wanted 4 luxuary resources of mine plus 100 gold per turn. I mean like what the ♥♥♥♥? I nuked her later3. A.I can't fight period. Just get close to their city during and they will take off their clothes and give everything to you. Russia declared war on me for no reason, I was scared as I didn't know how much army he had. Turns out he had 2 horses and 1 chariot, 2 warriors. Well it will be understatement if I say I killed them, as I approached to his city with my mumulk (knights) and catapult and archers he♥♥♥♥♥♥his pants and gave me 300 gold per turn with 3 luxuary resources and the control over the city I was approaching in exchange for peace. Once the peace ended I declared war on him to finish him off.4. Spying wasn't that fun, maybe I didn't explore that enough. But I would like more depth in espionage, in previous Civ games i remember you could start revolution through espionage, poison city's water supply, and etc etc. I like more options other the current options of stealing funds, art work.5. Can't trade technologies, can't trade maps, can't trade units (This one i am not sure, because I got no allies, forever alone).6. A.I spamming missionaries, if I don't have open border deal with them, they shouldn't be in my territory. Tomyris of Scythia has been sending 5-6 missionaries to my territories even though there is no open border deal and they block your units, what the ♥♥♥♥ is that seriously. She had 6 missionaries surrounding my city, I nuked my own terriority in frustration to kill those *******.There are other things that are frustrating, it is so frustrating that we get our video games like this full of buggs. Shame on you Sid Meier for releasing a game in this condition. Doesn't matter if you patch this game (you better), this is not acceptable. This is total rip off, I don't see how anyone can defend this game. I would give this game a 2/10, is this game unplayable? no it is not. You can play the game but the intended mechanics of the game don't work. The reason why I give 2/10 is because if you are going to charge me premium price for the game then you better have something more than just a playable game.Just one note on technical issues, I haven't been able to exit the game properly. Everytime I quit the game using ""quit to desktop"" the game just freezes and I have to mannually restart my PC."
56,757.2,Not Recommended," November 6, 2016",260,"I am a beloved fan of Civilization series. Historical context is important, and I think this game really nails it; although, I feel like the game completely leaves out a huge array of notable historical moments, people, things, etc that could easily be in the game.Here are my Pros and Cons lists:Pros (with some cons):1) Graphics are astonishing; however, it seems like there's an unecessary mix of more realistic, yet cartoonish feel to the graphics. Civilization 5 had more realistic looking scenery, units, and buildings, and should have just been updated off of that.2) Unit combat: Unit combat is far more intruiging to watch; the animations are more compelling to see play out.3) Unit Stacking: FINALLY! Unit stacking is incorporated into the game; however, you can either only stack a military unit with a support unit, or stack numerous units of the same type into the same hex... this, I still don't understand. I don't fully grasp the idea as to why the developers seem to not understand anything related to how an actual military functions.4) Leader Interactions: Interacting with a leader is more pleasing. Leader animations are far more enjoyable, and they have expressions depending on if they're pleased or upset.5) District building: Incorporating districts is a huge plus for this game. You can view all the buildings under construction as well as when they're finished; everything isn't just assumed it's in the city like in previous games. The layout of the districts also is really neat. Placing districts, like a holy site, nearer a mountain actually helps improve the income of faith because you're next to a mountain. Harbor district is my favorite, because wonders are really neat to build around the harbor.6) Wonders are far more interesting, and enticing, to build. Wonders build up more and more as you construct them, which is fun to watch over time. Once complete, viewing the wonder in it's animation completion shows the surrounding area in which is built, which makes it that much more intruiging. The Wonders, themselves, look very impressive.7) Attempting to achieve other victories rather than just domination is more enjoyable. Disctricts and Wonders help with drawing you to win the game with other victories. I haven't won the space race yet, but the steps it takes to get there seem really interesting (building a launch site [district], orbital satelite, moon landing, mars landing).Unfortunately, the CONS outway the Pros:1) Setting up a game isn't nearly as in depth as Civilization 5. Theres very few map types, ""Huge"" isn't even huge at all for maps; you are placed really near other civs. There's no Earth map, which is a big thumbs down for me.2) There's no point in trying to win the game on anything beyond Emperor difficulty. Starting on Emperor difficulty, other civs start with WAY too many military units, cities, and benefits. The Emperor difficulty is the third from hardest difficulty, so how do the developers expect you to have ANY chance of winning on Deity? Starting out the game, the only thing you can even try to do is constantly produce military units, but even then... there's not a great chance to win this on Emperor difficulty.3) Map sizes are not NEARLY big enough. I'm partial to having the biggest available map possible, and I'm sure I'm far from being the only one. I want large scale battles against numerous civs across numerous continents. HUGE on Civ 6 isn't even close to giving you that opportunity. You'd be lucky to have more than three cities. Huge gives you 12 civs to play against, but the map puts everyone far too close to one another, and you have little opportunity to expand or build large armies.4) The Graphics have too much of a cartoon feel for my liking. Yes, there are GREAT graphical aspects to this game, but there's too much of a backwards step for me to thoroughly give the overall graphics a good enough rating to enjoy.5) The Hex tiles feel like they were made larger in this game. I could be wrong, but that's the impression I get, which makes the game much smaller than it should be.6) Yet again, the diversity of units is completely lacking. You have numerous unique units for every civ, but most only get one unique unit. The Germans get only the U-Boat... really? They had some of the most specific units in military history, and they only get 1 unique unit.7) NO MOD SUPPORT! Supposedly there's going to be mod support, but this should have been launched with the game. The developers have specifically stated that the MOD aspect of this game is one of the most popular aspects to the game itself, since freelance developers can make the game much larger, and more enjoyable to play. Until Mod support is released, this game is simply not as enjoyable as it could be.8) Having a very limited game being launched, such as Civilization 6, displeases me. Games used to be made as complete as possible back in the day, and these days, developers seem to just say, ""Well, looks good enough. We'll just release patches as we go along."" No, I bought this game to play NOW, not wait 6 months for me to actually start enjoying the game.Overall, I'm disappointed with the launch of this game. I know the game will improve, but I don't buy a game to enjoy later. Don't purchase this game until AT LEAST mod support is released."
22,154.5,Not Recommended," January 14, 2017",7,"I'm sad that I cannot recommend this game in its current state. It feels like the dev team rushed to include many items into the game but did not take the time to ensure they all mesh together and (very importantly) that the AI is ready to handle them. Virtually everything feels shallow and in many ways a silly representation of what we came to expect from the Civ series. From religious units that block movement of military ones (and the silly religious combat that represents nothing from real life), to the poor implementation of Eurekas that rather than making you form a unique civilization instead it allows you to be in atomic era by 200 AD. The game overall becomes a silly clickfest that ultimately ends with a victory condition you probably wasn't planning on.It also does not help at all that the devs neglected to properly document the game. The civilopedia is as useless as ever. The major problem with this is that you are unsure if something is working as intended or it is a bug that needs fixing. The devs have fixed some stuff that we thought were how they were meant to be and clarified other details as intentional features not bugs.Overall, the game is silly. It is a mess right now. I hope FREE patches will make it what it supposed to be: a deep and complex experience not a shallow and needlessly complicated point-and-click game. But for now, I simply cannot recommend it.

In addition to that, the Spy system is broken almost completely - you can get spied for money (basically a high powered money theft directly from a city) but the enemy can steal more money than you have. This will immediately plunge your empire into chaos, with no indication of how much longer you still need to survive with 0 gold until this imaginary debt has been repaid. Add to that the fact that it is impossible to defend every district of a city from spies, and that this game encourages you to have more than 4 cities, and you end up in a money draining fight against yourself. Your empire crumbles, revolutions happen, units disband, and you lose. All because of a single spy.Until this is fixed, I cannot recommend the game as it is simply not enjoyable.

20,243.6,Recommended," October 21, 2016",7,"EDIT:More comments after playing for 70 more hours, beating delty difficulty and play several multiplayer games:-AI:Besides bad battle strategies, which I mentioned before, all civs also have very similar developing strategies. Everyone in the game are racing for religious - build holy sites, religioius wonders and religious buildings. I understand that faith is strong in Civ 6, but it is not worth building holy site as the first district of ALL cities. Developing strategies should be different for all civs, since each civ has its own advantages, rather than simply focusing on faith and training tons of unique units.+Corp and Army:This new mechanics can be identified as a variant of an old mechanics - allowing multiple units to occupy the same hex/octagon. However, it is not as strong. The reason I want to point it out is that corp and army (and equivalence in naval units) are mostly unlocked by civics, which gives civs with high culture another way to fight against civ with high science points. The disadvantage is in order to do this you also need high productivity.-MultiplayerCurrently multiplayer are quiet unplayable - full of bugs and problems. In the staging room I can invite my steam friends to join a game, but if someone disconnected (pretty common and resync doesn't work most of the time), I can neither invite them while I am in-game, nor save the game and load it again - when I load a saved game, I can't send in-game invitation to my friends who are in this saved game. Steam invitaion still works but I and some of my friends found that Civ 6 will interfere with steam overlay and make it not usable.Another problem is in the staging room. When I try to add more AIs (more than 8) to the game a red text 'unsupported' will pop up no matter which map size I chose. Though I can ignore it and the game works fine, it is still annoying. Further more, if I choose 'close' for those new slots, it will be displayed as an AI. But after I start the game, there is no extra AI at all.I tend to believe that multiplayer is the hardest part for this game and I should be forgiving for this part. But now I feel that this Civ 6 is only an alpha version in multiplayer. Even the staging room is not ready for offcial release - number of players are hard coded, and the user interface is not completed. If you have ten or more slots in the lobby you will notice that the user interface for tenth and later slots are missing elements.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Good game so far. In my opinion, it is better than Civilization V original version, but it still needs improvement to reach the level of BNW.+Graphic:It has excellent graphic, much better than what I thought. I run my game in ultra so I assume I saw the best graphic of the game. Buildings and units are vivid in the game, and woonders are beautiful. THere might be people that don't like the carton style of this game but I love it.+Soundtrack:I haven't listened to all musics in only 6 hours of play but what I've heard so far is impressive. I like the music played in main menu, I played as Rome and China in game and their themes are also good.-UI:Menus (including main menu and in-game menus) are simpler and more intuitive than Civ 5. However, most of the problems of this game are coming from UI.First, the in-game map and minimap are confusing - I understand that Civ 6 wants to give us a historic-appearing map but buildings and terrains need to be more clear. Tribal villages and buildings are hard to see on the map.Second,, district nneds to be clear. Currectly districts don't show their product in citizen management, which causes a lot of confusion. And it seems that cost of each district will increase with the number of districts I have, but such mechanism is not mentioned anywhere.Third, the screen scrolling is awkward. Screen can only scroll in four directions (instead of eight) and if I want to scroll upward, I need to put my mouse right below the information bar (instead of upper edge of the screen). Civ 5's scrolling is perfect but civ 6 is much worse. I really don't understand why Firaxis doesn't copy what they did.+Performance:Game runs flawlessly. I haven't run into any error so far but I heard some people did. The loading time for booting the game application, starting a new game, and each turn is shorter than Civ 5.+-Civ:The number of civs available in this game is about the same as the number of civs in Civ 5 original version. The civs have some uniqueness, but there are balance issues here. I feel uncomfortable about Greece's dual leader, maybe there will be two leaders for each civ in the future?-AI:Pretty bad AI so far. Barbarians are much stronger and much more aggresive in the early game - way more than they need to. In addition to that, there is no uniqueness in civ's AI. In Classic era, every civ are unfriendly to everyone else in the game and war is declared more often and more unreasonable. So the early and early-mid game is full of wars to barbarians and to other civs and there is no time to do other things. However, AI plays worse in war than Civ 5. With the change in movement mechanics 2 tile ranged units (yes, archer) are even stronger than in CIv 5, and this makes wars a lot easier. Therefore, the only benefit from this poor AI is that I can gain lots of gold from each civ who declared a war on me.+-Technology and policyI like the idea of policy tree, which puts culture at the same position as science. And I also like the idea of government. Although it is a little bit complicated, I think every player can handle it. But both technology and policy trees are not well design and, to be honest, the boosts are too strong that they are changing Civ 6 to a quest-completing game. Firaxis should think more carefully about these new mechanisms.+DistrictsDistrict helps enforcing the idea that cities need to be specialized. Each city has a very limited number of districts available, which means a single city can't do all things for you. District also forces me to organise my tiles more carefully for each city. However, as I mentioned before, the lack of information of districts in gameplay is serious. Improvements are necessary for all players to get used to this new mechanism.Overall I think this is a good game, good enough for the first version. But improvement is still needed to bring this game to satisfaction. I hope Firaxis can make this game better with further DLCs."

12,57.6,Not Recommended, March 19,7,"After excellent Main menu music and few first steps into the game i found myself a bit disappointed.I found it weird that AI civs follow their agenda in such onesided way... In other words, someone is allways denouncing you because of something stupid..... for example:- french hate you because of poor espionage (and they have default bonuses for espionage)- chinese hate you for building wonders, even one will do the work....- Romans hate you for not growing while french hate you for growing- Russians and aztecs hate you for not having much religion and greeks hate you for not having culture- warmonger status will remain, and remain and remain....and since you cant focus 100% on all culture/science/war/religion.... balancing in the golden middle road is frustrating...of course, you can setup a game and choose civs that have similar priorities, but that gets boring in time.I have enjoyed all civilizations since the very first one, perhaps civ4 being the best but the VI is something that i just stopped playing..... its blend, its vanilla, and its not grand strategy at all.... only frustrating enter-clicking.but still, not all cons. there are pros too:- i like districts, you dont have to built everything in every city. This is actually a good feature.- cartoonish characters and game map is also a good feature, its a fantasy game afterall- separate tech trees for science and culture is daring attempt for something new. (it gives weird Jetfighter/musketmen combos) but i guess its acceptable."
13,122.6,Not Recommended," November 1, 2016",103,"It has been tough for me to admit to myself that Civilization 6 is, in its essentials, a fundamentally broken game. I have been playing the Civilization games since Civ II/ Alpha Centauri. I have also, in between releases, played many of the turn-based strategies that clearly owe a lot to Civilization, including the Galactic Civilizations series, Age of Wonders, Total War, etc., all since the early days (I realize that I am betraying both advanced age and a misspent life here). Civilization always felt like the original and for that reason special.Ironically it has taken a lot of work to break this game so completely. The root of the problem lies in a slow progression of intended improvements to the game that have both totally outstripped the abilities of the AI and have erected impediments in the ability of human players to do things which used to be straightforward. Many of the core problems arise from the decision, in Civ 5, to de-stack units in an effort to make combat feel more tactical, and then impose this tactical combat framework on the strategic map. That decision created loads of obvious and basic problems that many others have already commented on in the context of reviewing Civ 5: e.g., tactical battles that stretch over hundreds of years, a confused crowding of the campaign map with units, etc. Because there was a lot to like about Civ 5, I had hoped that Civ 6 would find a way to improve some of these issues. Unfortunately, they seem to have gotten worse.The first and most obvious problems with Civ 6 relate to the complete inability of the AI to play the game. Computer players in Civ 5 were dumb, but in Civ 6 now they are beyond dumb- they simply cannot function in a way that is rational at the most basic levels. With respect to discrete tactical battles that involve more than a couple of units, the AI is utterly helpless. It neither exploits advantages or guards against weaknesses- not even to the limited extent the AI could do these things in Civ 5. The AI is even worse when it comes to managing armies at a strategic level. The AI is utterly unable to mount an effective invasion force even between two neighboring cities on the same continent, let alone on a broader scale. Adding water tiles to the mix completely flummoxes the AI, as units without escort repeated kill themselves by hurling themselves at your naval units and well-fortified coastal cities, without support or the slightest possible chance of success. Forget the significant overseas naval invasions that the AI would sometimes surprise you with in Civ 4: that is completely beyond the capabilities of this game. I have played Civ 6 quite a bit already have yet to have an interesting tactical engagement with a computer player (fighting of hordes of uncoordinated horsemen is not interesting). On top of all that, for some reason, the AI in Civ 6 seems much worse than ever before at advancing itself technically, and seems to prefer spawning hordes of older units to mindlessly throw at you. I am not saying that I am some genius and that I am so much smarter than the AI. Rather, I am saying that a lobster is smarter than the AI. In sum, the dynamics of turn-based tactical combat on the hex-based strategic map are just too much for any AI to handle.But the problem goes beyond just the AI and the Computer players' inability to play. In essence, I can understand why the AI has problems, because I too find it exceedingly difficult to assemble and move even a modest-sized mixed-unit force from one place to another. Because units can no longer be organized into stacks, each step in the process of mustering an army, moving it, transporting it, supporting it, and attacking with it, is a horrid logistical mess. And because of that, each step takes multiple turns, so if you try to do it in an organized way, many years will pass (hundreds of years if you are early on in the game), units will obsolete, etc., all of which is just dumb. And again, Civ 6 exacerbates rather than alleviates these problems by adding layers of additional technologies, structures, and districts needed to recruit and organize a mixed-unit army. For example, I used to enjoy putting together a solid force of land units supported by a navy, and move them over to assault coastal cities. That was fun in Civ 4, a real pain but doable in Civ 5, and torture in Civ 6. At the most basic level, Civ 5's experiment with attempting to overlay mixed-unit-tactical combat on the strategic map has failed on multiple levels, and Civ 6 has amplified that failure. The AI can't handle it, and although it can be fun in very limited circumstances, for the most part it doesn't work and is more of a pain than a benefit.I'm not sure what to recommend. An improvement in the AI would be a big help, but given the complexity of this game, I am not sure that is possible for any AI to handle it. Another option would be to allow a partial or total stacking of units, which could not only help the AI, but solve a lot of other messes created by the hex system. Regardless, something needs to be done, as the game really does not work as it stands."

Never even saw one of their units before the war was over.But my main problem is while I like the concept of the districts it has too much focus on the wrong kind of Micromanaging making me feel like an accountant looking at a pretty spreadsheet rather than a CIV game.I would wait until there is a new one and see what changes they make."

You'll find people with tanks fighting against spearmen frequently. It feels like there's nothing here except a few gimics. I honestly would have got a refund but because civ is so long I went over the allowed time. SO now I've wasted £50 on a game i don't like playing. Don't make the same mistake as me. Get civ 5.
97,107.0,Not Recommended," October 22, 2016",211,"First off: I hope that I can change this review later on, they hopefully will patch many of the problems the game currently has. And yes, there are gamebreaking bugs right now.1. You want a military victory? Fine, take it. There will be no real defence from the AI. Why not? Well, even worse than in Civ5, they just stumble around with their units, have no plan what to do. If you have one Archer and one Warrior out in the field (not even near a city), you can beat up to 5 or 6 enemy troops easy. Why? Well, their archers often donÄt even attack you, but just stand there, while their warriors attack your one warrior like suicide-squads... it is funny to see, but in the end you win every war because the AI just doesn't use what they have.2. You want to talk with the AI? Forget it.2.1. Yes, they all have agendas... but that is more slapstick. Queen Victoria loves rich people because she loves money (okay...?), so in turn 288 she tells me that she loves my good income. Well, then she suffers a stroke, and while I still have the same income, in turn 289 she tells me that I am a poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Interesting!2.2. Roosevelt loves his Taoism. I am Catholic, he is my Ally. I see his 2 Apostles and 1 Missionary, and ask him to NOT use them o my cities. He says ""Yes"" and uses them in the same turn against my cities. I get informed that he broke his promise... and that is it. I ask him again, he says ""Yes"" again, breaks it next round again. There is no consequence. The AI will always say ""Yes"" to everything - No spies? Yes, of couse, but let me send you this spy. No religion? Yeah, just ignore my 4 other missionaries going to you right now.In the end, there is no dimplomcy, there are no promises, it is just a ""feature"" without any meaning or consequence whatsoever.2.3. So yeah, the AI is not able to win any battle, and not able to remember what they promised you 30 seconds ago, but when it comes to trading, WOW, they are hardcore. One for one? Hell no! The AI will only accept trades that are very one-sided, and maybe because of that they will not really trade with each other. When you meet a new Civ after round 300, they will suddenly make you big offers to trade goods... they could do that with all the other Civs, too, but since they all want 1 for 2, nobody trades in the end. Bravo!3. The ""Politics"" in the game are pretty meaningless. They simply are. The boosts may be great for pro-players in tournaments, but for a casual player they are just a big part of the game with little to no consequence for the gameplay.4. The Civilizations are not balanced at all. If you start 5 games, you will always see the same Civilisations weak (England, hello! Germany, hello!), always the same civilizations strong (hi Mister Roosevelt, hi Tomyris!). This point is not yet a problem for me, because I don't played enough to see if it is really always the case or just a coincident. But I suspect major balancing-issues.So in the end, the game needs work. Most of the work is needed for the AI. Diplomacy is dead right now, promises are meaningless, when fighting, the big and mighty leaders are just toddlers without a clue. I hope this will get fixed soon, because after just a short ammount of in-game-time, it gets old and the bigs are too much too bear.PS: Sorry for mistakes, english is not my naitive language."
86,350.4,Recommended," December 30, 2017",123,"Despite the controversy surrounding this game, especially the art style, I really enjoy it. Civ VI vanilla is much more fleshed out than Civ V vanilla and Gods and Kings ever were. Here's my review:Pros- More fleshed out than Civ V vanilla was at launch- Workers actually have to be produced on a regular basis, no longer are there 5000 year old workers roaming the planet- The road building system is fun and is more historically accurate than having state workers build roads (except Rome)- Gaining influence over city-states is no longer a matter of being wealthy, its a serious challenge compared to Civ V- Districts and wonders being present on the map make territory and strategic planning of city development vital to success- The eureka/inspiration system is fun and makes research more interactive- Introduction of the civic tree makes culture just as vital as science, making player strategy more well rounded than it was in Civ V with social policies- The religious victory is a new option for peaceful victory and allows you to finally fight off the religious units of other civs w/o declaring war, which was a pain in the butt in Civ VCons- Not enough wonders from non-European countries especially from Asia and Africa.- Art style isn't for everyone- Diplomacy game is lacking because there is no world congress- Combat AI is still poor, and can easily be defeated, even with inferior numbers- Qin Shi Huang's character model is seriously weird- Agenda system attempts to rationalize AI aggression, but feels like more of an afterthought as the AI is aggressive regardless- Diplomacy AI is still bad, AI refuses to make peace unless you hand over all of your cities, even when they are down to a 3 population tundra city themselves.- Religious warfare is never-ending and the AI is obsessed with spreading its religion so it never relents on sending wave upon wave of religious units to you. The introduction of a non-interference treaty for religions, or something along the lines of that, would go a long way to preventing endless religious warfareOverall:Despite its many, many flaws, Civ VI is still a lot of fun to play, and builds upon the foundations that were laid by Civ V. City development and war mechanics bring the landscape to life and force the player to build and fight more strategically. Civ VI is definitely worth the money, and while it certainly has its issues, it is a worthy successor to the Civilization series."
20,628.4,Not Recommended," September 7, 2017",21,"Since the summer patch this game was beyond bad. None of my favorite mods that made the game playable are working anymore. Worst patch ever, and absolutely no communication from them.Also the mini map is horrible. The big square city icons will eventually cover the entire map and you wont be able to see anything if your playing on a bigger map. And the civ border colors bleed out past the coastlines so you can even tell what is water and what is land. It is hands down the worst mini-map ever in the entire 40 plus year history of video games. Completely and utterly useless. Don't even get me started on the horrible AI, complete lack of meanful diplomacy, or the balance issues because we would be here all night. I have gone back to CIV 5 and really enjoying it. I honestly regret buying this game and that's something I never thought I would say about a civ game.Conclusion : This is the SimCity5 of the Civilization Series.

99,35.2,Not Recommended," June 22, 2017",16,"Now this is purely subjective and I don't expect many to agree, but one of my main complaints about the game is its art style. Civilization's art style has always been a little cartoony, a tad campy, and more than a little playful, but this one takes all of that to the next level. Going to war with another Civ just doesn't feel genuine or interesting when you're negotiating a peace treaty with the pixar version Theodore Roosevelt.Subjectivity aside, Civ 6 appears to be suffering the same growing pains as Civ 5. Its vanilla version is somewhat lacking (confusing unit movement, missing notification log, unnecessarily frustrating new features like amenities, etc.) but with future expansion packs, the game became great. My final verdict is if you have never played a Civilization game and aren't too concerned with an overly silly art style, you might like this. Otherwise, just play BNW until an expansion is released."

Also, all the fun features of CIV5 are missing, i.e. golden ages, the world congress, world fair, futuristic army units, etc. Units can only move 1 space at a time making exploring tedious. The only viable start for any civilization is to rush an army and conquer a neighbor, which has removed all the diversity of the early game. The mid-late game crawls to a halt and the game becomes a non-interactive snoozefest. Once you’ve made it that far you automatically win because the AI doesn’t pursue win conditions. Just have a friend wake you up when it’s over.Lastly, CIV6 is very light on history and is filled with historically inaccuracies. They forced in a bunch of SJW agenda, including making Cleopatra a sassy black woman, while when anyone with a 5th grade education knows she was of Greek decent (not to mention she brought ruin to her country when she killed herself, and is a terrible choice for an Egyptian leader).This game sucks, is boring, poorly programmed, overpriced, and will make you stupid.

Fortunatly those can be fixed somewhat with mods.The biggest problem though is the game just crashes, all the time, at seemingly random itervals, sometimes to desktop, sometimes bluescreen.

During wars the AI often just walks to your cities without attacking anything and just waits within the range of the defending archers.- There is no feeling that your civilization is taking off. The production/research/income only increase slightly during the course of the game- The fog of war displays the areas as if they were drawn by pencil, which in return harms the overview- Really really bad GUI. Which is why I make a own section for thisThe GUI:- The tech trees provide almost no overview and info. I mean just look at this:You can only see the technologies of a single era without scrolling. Moreover, some passive bonuses are not directly displayed in the tech tree and are only shown via Mouse over. The cultural tech tree is even worse, since there are only four different icons for policies:- You have to wait for the leader animations to accept/refuse an AI initiated deal. Pressing escape aborts the whole diplomacy.- The GUI provides almost no info about the adjacency bonus, which you gain by building an improvement or an district- The City screen is cluttered (e.g. the main city screen only shows food income. Food surplus is hidden in a sub screen)- You have to select the city before you can see the maximum populace for the city- Warnings only pop up if cities are overpopulated and not if fully populated- Some sub windows (Building selection, Carawan destination) are drawn ontop of other windows in a weird way:- The scrolling via moving the mouse to the screen edges does not work well.- The icons and text are often very large, presumably because they are optimized for touch or controller input giving you the feel of a console port.- You cannot bypass automatic unit rotation by quickly selecting another unit after the first unit has finished moving.

Gotta say I love this one, and dare say it's a huge contender for the title of the best in the series.The changes are pretty dense, but easy to roll into after a few epic fail plays.

192,134.7,Recommended," December 10, 2017",101,"""Mostly Positive"" is a fair way to describe this game. The mechanics are superb, a great improvement over 5. City planning is a fun new aspect, and the inspirations make for a new and dynamic game every time you play as you take advantage of the situation you're given the best you can. Waging war is rewarded as well, unlike in its predecessor when having more cities crippled your infrastructure through unhappiness. And let's not forget an excellent presentation, including wonderful music, heartfelt narration, and utterly charming graphics and character design.Several problems are worth bringing up, however.The AI is terrible. Diplomacy is scarcely worth attempting, as the designers tried to balance the game by making computer players hate anyone that is doing well, and stamping tremendous relationship penalties for each city you take, even when at war with a third party and even when you are not the aggressor.On top of that, CPU players don't understand combat at all, to a downright embarrassing degree. It's unclear how the designers could have screwed that part up so bad, as the combat isn't all that complicated.There are also several interface issues, from unexplained mechanics like ranged unit obstructions, to combat predictions randomly displaying combat values in the tens of thousands. The Civilopedia is miserably incomplete and not always helpful, prompting excursions to the unofficial internet wiki to answer questions.Then we have the more egregious issues.Those who purchased the deluxe edition got ripped, plain and simple. On one hand, it's the own fault of consumers who threw their money at something without any concrete promise of what they were getting back, but on the other hand it took a very long time to get but a few extra leaders and Civs.We've been promised cross-platform compatibility between Windows and Mac since launch. They still have no definite date set for this.Patches have been slow to come and haven't fixed the major issues. Aspyr has, by all appearances, been very forthcoming about what they are hoping to achieve, but results have been consistently disappointing.Ultimately, this is a very, very good game, but it's anything but ""solid"". For multiplayer, it's the best Civ game out there, and overall it's one of the best 4x games out there. But I still think you should wait for a good sale."
56,198.8,Not Recommended," November 9, 2017",13,"Do you like Civ V? Just play Civ V.The mechanics of Civilization VI looked terrific on paper, but many were sloppily executed. I personally loved the implementation of un-stacked cities, it really made the placement of your cities important and added a completely new level of strategy to the game. The same goes for Wonders taking up an entire tile, adding on to the strategy of city placement even more. Having both science as well as civic trees was also a step forward in the series' game design in my opinion, it added a bit more depth to the progression of your civilization. Workers being replaced by the Builder unit was also a step in the right direction. By making builders spend charges to improve tiles instantly and then disappear after the charges were depleted got rid of the awkward ""what do i do with all these workers"" issue in the later stages of Civ V. But that's about where the pros end.While the ""agendas"" idea for world leaders was a cool idea, it was very poorly implemented. I think it is absolutely absurd that I have several civs full out DENOUNCING me because I happen to have a city on a continent they are absent from, or because I don't control a lot of land, or get really involved in espionage, the list goes on. I could completely understand them disliking me because of these, but to full on denounce me seems a little too far. And even if I do somehow manage to line up with their main agenda, they have a second, randomly generated hidden agenda (apart from Teddy and Gandhi) that can be anything from a love of science or culture or income etc, etc. It is not uncommon to play through a game and see that almost every civ has denounced every other civ. It was a great idea, just very poorly executed.After several updates, alliances are nearly impossible to make. The other civs' demands are outright ridiculous. They often demand you hand over at least 5000 gold and nearly your entire GPT amount, or want to declare a joint war against a civ they hate. Doing the latter will often brand you a warmonger amongst all the civs, even the one you're trying to ally.Warmongering is mostly fine in this game thanks to both the deductions based on the era you're in as well as the casus belli system. My biggest complaint is that if, for example, both you and Teddy strongly dislike Victoria so you decide to declare war on her. Unless you perform a casus belli that reduces the warmonger penalty to zero, everyone including Teddy will dislike you for it. This was not an issue at all in Civ V, as friendly civs that disliked someone else as much as you cared not if you wiped them off the map.All in all Civ VI is about five steps forward, and two to three steps back for the Civilization series. I cannot recommend this game in the current state it is in."
448,130.4,Not Recommended," October 24, 2016",526,"EDIT: My review is a bit outdated, there's been a patch a week ago that fixed some of the problems.TL;DRTop 3 problems:1. Terrible User Interface that is impractical and lacks useful info but is filled with useless data in a bad format2. Absolutely horrible AI3. Unbalanced tech trees, construction costs and generally everything is unbalancedI was checking the bad reviews the next day after the launch and I was feeling quite angry at people that were bashing this game just after 2-3 hours of playing. I felt the game was quite well done, with a few bad things, sure, but I didn't feel there were enough reasons to give a negative review.However, now I see it in a different light. I've only played for around 30 hours, in those 30 hours I played 2 full games and after those 2 games I tried starting a third but I just couldn't do it. For how nice the game animations and overall style look, district planning, housing and amenity systems are, the game is riddled with problems and I just can't enjoy it anymore. The worst thing about it right now is the lack of info. Lack of info on what? ON EVERYTHING. The UI is terrible, just plain terrible, there's a lot of useless information that's being presented in a very cluttered way and A LOT of crucial information that's either hard to get to (for example you have to select your city and then go to the religion menu just to see how many citizens are of which religion) or, in most cases, just simply missing: things like religious pressure(you can sort of see it with a religious unit, but that's also not explained what it is and how it works) and border growth are just not there, also the Civilopedia pretty much won't help you with anything. So much info missing from it, there's almost nothing relevant explained in there.Also, the structure of the tech tree is absolutely terrible and illogical, to the point where you can get to information era without having techs from the ancient era or how you can build horse archer units/crossbowmen without ever researching archery. And if that wasn't enough, you can't even see at a first glance everything that ""X"" tech gives you. Some techs give you passive bonuses,unlocks etc. But you have to mouse over the empty space in the tech for it to show you. Most of the time you'd forget about those ""hidden"" bonuses if the advisor wouldn't tell you about it.The Barbarians, however, seem to have improved quite a bit, but even there you will see some questionable decisions(sometimes) for the AI, like leaving the camp to attack an archer, even though there are 2 more units near it, ready to just capture the camp and kill the unit. And I feel like after around the 70-90 turns mark they become quite a non-entity, their units rarely seem to scale with eras and they can't even count as ""annoying"" since they'll get obliterated instantly.The AI of leaders though is just plain terrible. Many players were fooled into thinking it's a great improvement over the CIV 5 AI just because they got attacked early with a big army. However, once you get over that initial attack(which probably happens because of the inexistent and light war penalties in the first 2 eras), the AI becomes just another barbarian civilization that's not really doing much. You see them warring eachother often but you almost never see them taking a city or something, there's nothing real there. It just feels so fake and scripted, I've played Civ 4 and 5 and the thing that kept me coming back to play was a sense that I wasn't the only one making decisions in the game, the civilization AI was there making decisions with/against me, everyone seemed to be more involved in what's going on in the game. But in Civ 6, everything dies after the first 2 eras. If you can't understand what I mean, just check this: the AI gets an extra settler in Emperor, Immortal and Deity difficulties. In Civ 5 that only happened on Deity. That should tell you something if the AI requires such bonuses to be relevant at a difficulty like Emperor.(hint: it's still not relevant)The production times also make no sense and I can't understand why the wonders have to cost so much. It's standard for a wonder to take around 40~ turns to build in your best city and I can't understand who thought this is a good idea. You already have to build district that eat away your tiles yields + seeing as how every wonder needs a tile to be placed on(which also eats away all the yields of the tile) and they have specific types of tiles they require. Why, above all that, add a ridicoulous production cost for them. I just can't see the reasoning.Pretty much everything is an unbalanced mess.I'm not even going to talk about things like the AI being completely illogical with their declarations and the broken selling units mechanic.Now, to add some pros: I like the districts and the new way of wonder tiles, the cities look way better, you now need to specialize your cities and build everything more carefully, which I like very much. But the best thing about Civ 6 is the religious warfare and the fact that faith is not such a hard ""resource"" to gain if you don't get the perfect pantheon in the beginning.--------------------I'd advise to not buy it yet."

The majority of my games start with the same patter; Grow city, 1 or 2 builders, 2 or 3 military and a decent plan on how to grow/ apply a strategy. Hey, I meet a 3 new civs. They dislike me. I start to trade with 1, then next turn they (+ another civ) declare war. No boarder issues. No history. No reason.Once the war is over, I am left with a strong militart and weak neighbouring civs. I grow well, boost trade etc etc. And that is it for the rest of my game. I may find another strong civ accross the world, but by then you'll know their ""strategy"" and counter it elsewhere in your civ.I agree with other reviews about city planning/districts, as well as research boosts. Both cool ideas. But comparing where Civ 5 left off and this began feels werid. This game does religion well, and trading seems similar (I actually liked road building in Civ5).

201,51.7,Not Recommended," December 31, 2016",6,"A game that, if it fixed the one major flaw, would be an easy recommend.Main issue: A.I. is beyond braindead. Each civilization you meet has an agenda you can see. It tells you that a certain civilization likes it if your science is superior to theirs or if they hate warmongers. The problem is, these agendas don't seem to matter. I've gotten declarations of friendship from civilizations I am directly going against their agenda while civilizations that SHOULD like me more for meeting their ""likes it when..."" agenda denounce and declare war on me. Now, this would be acceptable IF the AI understood what ""war"" is.My last game, I had both the Kongo and China declare war on me on the same turn with no actual provocation. Ok, however, 30+ turns later, I finally see China has sent its' army to attack me, still no sign of Kongo's armies. The problem goes even deeper here as China's ""army"" consists of two warriors. I easily repel China's pitiful display of force and they negotiate peace with me by giving me lots of money. During the same game, Russia declared friendship with me and one turn later declared war on me.The A.I. doesn't seem to have the ability to properly pursue goals so it blindly and almost randomly makes decisions. What little the AI actually pursues, it seems to pursue counter to what it pursues. Washington hates warmongers, so it declares war on me and not the guys with a warmonger penalty.IF Civ6 fixed the AI's issues, I would easily recommend the game, but as is it just isn't fun playing against an AI that is easily the worst AI I've seen in years.The less bad issues: UIThe UI is alright, it's nothing stellar. I've still not found a good screen that shows detailed info about my Cities and I seem to run into problems as such. Diplomacy is needlessly slow (Leader says something, then slowly another menu appears in the lower left of the screen, then slowly another menu appears). Shortcuts for toggling the different map filters (showing best places to settle, etc) are placed in submenues (was a better system in Civ5 imo). The UI is hardly a deal breaker, it's functional, but it does have room for improvement.The good:Relatively few bugs. I've yet to really run into a noticable bug.Civilization 6: Complete edition! Civ6, unlike Civ5 or Beyond Earth, doesn't feel like a game that needs two expansions to make it a complete game, it's its' own game that will be improved by expansions rather than rely on them.Sound! I love the music in the game. It's just good music. The voiceacting is good (miss Nemoy though...).The indifferent:The art style. I'm not entirely sure how to feel about it. It's nice in some ways, but sometimes the art style makes it hard to differentiate certain terrains imo. I don't think it's bad, I don't think it's good.TL;DR: Don't recommend solely due to the braindead AI that doesn't know what it wants or how to obtain what it seems to want. Overall, a great game ruined by a single issue."

30,83.6,Not Recommended," April 24, 2017",6,"There is a lot of promise here but it all amounts to nothing because the AI is completely hopeless. The biggest issue seems to be that the AI has no intention to actually ""win"" the game. It doesn't seem to realize that it's even playing a game. The AI is stuck conforming to these moronic personality rolls and the score is the last thing on its mind. It may stumble Mr Magoo-like into a victory if you let it, but no matter what difficulty you put it on, the game is just too easy, particularly the late game.The major AI issues currently are:-The AI doesn’t know it’s playing a game.-The AI doesn’t know it should be trying to win.-The AI won’t build new cities unless there are perfect locations available.-The AI won’t settle half the map even if there are perfect locations available.-The AI can’t tactics.-The AI can’t strategy.-The AI just isn't interested in playing CIV VI...I really want to play this more but until the AI is fixed it just leaves a disappointing aftertaste every time any early game challenge melts away and victory is a certainty."

The game mechanics are somewhat good but have many severe problems as is evident by the many other reviews in this section even if these mechanics were great there is still one problem that persists. The god damned AI acts like no rational human being or a ♥♥♥♥ing living thing would ever act ever. Now I know people complained about the AI in civ 5 but it wasnt this bad and it was still playable and civ 5 had many other redeeming game mechanics that made up for it civ 6 apart from the government system, active science, and districts is essentially a direct downgrade to civ 5 and many of the redeeming features of civ 6 can easily be added as mods to civ 5 which by the way if you havent heard in its current state civ 6 cannot be modded through the steam workshop (this statement is now false as a recent update was released that included modding tools hooray!). The game has serious potential however like most games that follow the DLC model the developers purposefully have withheld content for releasing it in overpriced DLCs these arent new ideas sold in DLCs they are things that should be included in the base game. What developer can justify not only not releasing modding tools on launch but planning to put them in a DLC? Conclusion: I ♥♥♥♥ing love the new mechanics however the rest of the game is a direct downgrade from previous versions and the game is being hurt by money hungry developers adding useless DLCs of content that should be included. Im gonna have to say no for now. If you really want a great 4x strategy game that releases sensible DLCs, communicates with its fanbase and takes regular suggestions from the community along with nearly monthly updates jam packed with content and one with a great modding community there is one game on the market for you, Stellaris which in my opinion is currently the greatest 4x strategy game currently available on steam, wait 2 or 3 years for these developers to get their♥♥♥♥♥♥together and play stellaris in the meantime I gurantee you will not be dissapointed in your choice of spending, also stellaris costs 20 dollars less and has much better content which gets constantly expanded through free content along with sensible DLCs containing meaningful additions so theres that too."

478,143.7,Recommended," October 22, 2016",6,"A decent Civ game with a lot of room for growth (Definitely better than Vanilla Civ V).The more I play of this game the more I'm starting to realise that this game has quite a lot to offer, from the start the UI and Graphics may put some people off, but this game is still worth checking out.While there are a few systems I don't agree with such as the Micromanaging involved in cities (Housing and Amenities), Ruthless Barbarians and the Always Angry AI, I would still implore any fan of the series to give this game a fair chance before writing it off.From what I can tell the always angry AI issue does seem to fix itself later into the game, granted the majority of them remain unfriendly throughout the entire game, a few do seem to ease up and stop being less anal about small issues as time goes on, but overall I do feel the AI does need some improvements in order to make the game feel like a step up from the previous installment.This one might just be me, but the game does seem to have slight issues with the optimisation and issues do start to arise the longer into a session you get, but other than that the game runs rather smoothly. (There have been a few crashes for people I play with and the game does seem to desync a lot, however I'm not sure how common an occurance this is for other players, so keep that in mind)I really am a fan of the Government system, I personally feel it adds quite a bit of depth to the game and allows you to get some unique benefits such as being millitary units with faith that can really help to make a playthrough feel different than others.The Civics tree adds to this, by mostly giving you new Government policies to use, but can also get you new units or buildings similar to the tech tree. This is another welcomed addition due to the fact that it does add another aspect to the game that will differ from each playthrough.While I do have some gripes with the game, such as not being able to rename cities and having to micromanage each city you make, I do feel like this game provides quite the experience. Being around 30hours in right now I can safely say that this game is definitely worth checking out, while in some areas it feels a little lacking, in others the game has been expanded in a way that almost makes you forget about some of the issues. As well as this, a few of the issues I have with the game do seem to sort out the further into a game you get (such as Barbarians and the ever-angry AI).There are still quite a few things that this game needs to make the game feel complete, which is why I wouldn't recommend buying this game at full price unless you're a diehard fan of the series as in its current state you'll really feel the need for more to be added to the game, however when hasn't this been the case with a brand new Civilization game?TL;DR - Great start with a few new systems to make for interesting gameplay, but definitely still needs a few more updates / DLCs to surpass Civ V with Expansions."

402,20.0,Recommended," October 20, 2016",6,"*** Second Edit:Okay, now granted the game only shows me having played 5.7 hours or so, I must clarify that I've got about 30 hours offline so far. (I work a lot, so play time is minimal when I can get to it).I still think the game is amazing. It's not perfect. But it's complete, and it works.I could sit here and nit pick at the little details that could make the game better. Or I can sit here and tell you that it's a vast improvement over previous Civ games, while acknowledging some shortcomings.If you're a fan of the Civ franchise, you'll like it just fine.If you were iffy, try a demo or test out a cracked copy if you can before spending the dough. But personally, I agree with the expense for the replayability, and long lasting matches.For the record: I never stop at 500th turn.** First Edit:Alright, over 5 hours in now. Still no gameplay issues. Only ""bug"" I've encountered, is the same I've had with Civ 4, Civ 5 and now Civ 6, which is an occasional game crash preventing you from exiting properly. Ctrl+Alt+Del, then logout solves it easily.For some, it's a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ If I gotta do it once every few session ends, I don't care. Cause typically I gotta shut down my machine.But anyways...I like what they've done with the AI. After 5 hours in a single game so far, the Barbarians are all but extinct. They're very selective when they appear, and what they attack. I love how they've incorporated the thinking process for them.As for the other Civ's in-game. Scythia has been proving to be a pain in my♥♥♥♥♥♥ She just keeps backstabbing me. Attacked me early on, I fended her off with 2 Crossbowman, 1 Trebuchet, and City Defenses. She had 10 troops.Over 200 turns with nothing but agreeing with each other. She offers open borders (for each). I figured why not, I've done it with everyone else.Within 2 turns, I'm swarmed. I mean SWARMED, with knights and crap. Holy hell. I have India on the right amassing a highly advanced civ to my borders, and Scythia to my right invading me and declaring outright war. I think she outnumbers me 5-1 right now.I know this game is ending, and going to end violently. But I embrace this chaos, FOR IT IS TIL DEATH OR NO GLORY!Still rated 9/10 so far.____________________________________Alright. Two Hours in.I'm going to bed, stayed up late for the launch.... ZERO regrets.Game launches and runs perfectly on my machine. No bugs, no lag, no glitches, perfect visuals.Gameplay is new but the same. It's so much more in depth than most Civ games before it, but feels more fluid and easy to get a handle on if you've played these games before.To the nay sayers due to the visuals, it's a different art style. Stop complaining and enjoy it for the gameplay.I'm not going to write much more, but I do need to say HOLY EFFING BARBARIANS! lol they swarm man... you gotta go for the nests and fight them or they will not leave you alone and they are a worthy opponent on their own.I've now reached 4 cities, working on a 5th.

70,33.2,Not Recommended," December 28, 2016",6,"I've been a CIV player since CIV I - the one where the one square attacks the other - leaving one standing:)Bought CIV VI to take a look at the new concepts, some like Disctrict should be nice additions - like they are in Endless legends for example. The overall picture however is that one the strenghts of the CIV series (thought through and clear) are not there (at the moment)Like- districs concept- nice graphics- smooth startup (good on hardware)- the new builders!- the combination ability of units and auxiliary- cultural vs tech advances! Nice touch!- wonder treatment - no more wonder spamming citiesdislike- extremely limited info (when you're at a city screen checking out existing buildings, wonders a) it takes a lot of clicking and b) the perks are not accesed by a simple right click (the the civilopedia).- no looking forward info - any perk to come will not show in any help- really the help is terrible and not CIV worthy- Religion - as soon as a religious unit is selected a view over the game pops up, very unclear- Diplomacy - there is none that actually makes sense. Also - hard to get info on tour advisaries. Be prepared to be denounced all around, no matter what you do- totally stupid AI. Unrealistic with military and religious units.- City setup and info screen - Cities shoud be facilitating your grand strategy - now both most info is unclear and most cities end up more or less the same- Naval setup - the influence of a good navy is very limited, making sea aimed CIVs irrelevant. That does not seem to fit actual history....In short: the general setup is nice, he game however is nowhere near the gameplay of the older CIVs- needs a LOT of work.

Between the AI issues that others are remarking upon and the difficulties associated with the new wonder placement rules, I just can't get into this. The game steals and modifies the district placement rules from Endless Legend, but still restricts the size of city to the traditional Civ 24 plots. The result is real difficulty growing your cities. It isn't that the game is too difficult, it's that its more boring than previous Civs. And I even liked the Beyond Earth game!I do like the new culture tree innovation, though, and that the game takes so much less load time and has fewer spam messages from the AI. Beyond that? Meh."
57,7.2,Not Recommended, January 7,6,"I receieved Civilization VI through the Humble Bundle for this month. Strongly recommend that anyone who has wanted to try Civilization VI to sign up for this month's bundle, it's literally only 12 dollars for Civ, 2 DLCs, and whatever other games they put out.Coming as a Civilization V fanatic and having fond memories of Civilization IV, I had semi-high hopes for this game to be my new favorite Civ game.In my honest opinion, this game is NOT worth it at full price. It strips down a lot of what made Civilization V great with it's own kind of subpar experience on some things. I think most Civ fans agree with me on this one. Always look for it at the Steam sale or Humble Bundle or whatever.Also, there's a bit of a glitch on my end where the game decides to be exclusive only to the bottom right part of the screen whenever I boot up the shortcut. Maybe it's a bug on my end, I dunno. Any solutions would be helpful.(just a disclaimer: me saying civ 6 isn't worth it at full price doesn't mean i absolutely hate it. there are a lot of games i absolutely love but i wouldn't buy at full price)"
369,47.3,Not Recommended," October 22, 2016",471,"It's hard to quantify what doesn't click in this game, but I just don't enjoy it like I have past games in the series. Might be a little long:- Turns take longer. Not necessarily sit and wait turns like late-game Civ 5, but each individual turn throughout the entire game has you managing things, so Civ 6 lacks the fast buildup phase that the other games had. That's due in large part to the next issue, which is...- Miltary conquest is happening, whether you want it to or not, regardless of difficulty. I enjoyed the civ building aspect of the series in the past, often ignoring military expansion in favor of just building my own civ. Can't really do that here, you will absolutely need to focus on defense, and often military units and actually using them just to get reasonable tech advancement.- Advancement doesn't have the same rewarding feel to it, either. The culture system and tech tree only have a few spots that feel like milestones, and the rest just quickly become ignored. It all seems built with a very specific goal in mind from the start, so you focus on getting certain cards and a government to support them, with no organic feel to the buildup. It makes it a bit tedious to play for hours, because there's little adaptation from an initial strategy you're somewhat bottlenecked into from the moment you pick your civ's leader.- The new spy system is atrocious. Build a spy, then you're forced to choose not just what city to defend or go against but also individual districts. For a larger city in late game, this turns into a maddening display of micromanagement that you're forced to repeat after a fairly short number of turns for each spy.- I'm also not a fan of the new builders. They're expendable units with a number of charges, rather than being persistent. You can't automate anymore. Some things they can repair on pillage, others have to be fixed through that city's production screen.- Barbarians are annoying. They ramp up in tech, your units don't wake on seeing an enemy in Civ 6, they're smarter about pillaging, and the map is worse about letting you know where to combat them. They aren't hard to deal with, they're just a constant aggravation that stops being fun fairly quickly combined with all of the other management you're doing.- Enemy civs are aggressive, and they stockpile units like crazy. Even at farily early turns it seems like you're being swarmed, and with so many of the civs being military-centric they don't hesitate to declare war on you. This is probably fine if you enjoy Civ as a wargame, but that's never been what I liked about it and I still don't find the combat any more compelling in this version than it was in 5.- Wonders don't feel that wonderful anymore. They take up precious expansion hexes, they take forever to build, and often it's a tossup if it's even worth it. You're not going to mass produce them like past games, it's not even possible. The screens when you do complete one are neat, but you're rarely going to see any of them.- At 1440p the UI is ungodly small. Little tiny X's to close windows, and a number of other issues make it a bit frustrating to get the information you need when you need it.It's not that Civ 6 is a bad game, it's just only going to be a good one for a particular mindset of player. This is a less casual, far less relaxing game than the others in the series that focuses far too much on armies and not enough on the things that always made Civ stand out to me from other strategy games. It also seems like games actually take longer to complete in Civ 6 than they did even in 5, but at least the save feature is a little better.It'll be better after an expansion or two to streamline things, but right now I don't recommend it unless you're the warmongering type or only ever played the previous entries in the series on the highest difficulties."

Maybe in a few years on sale I pick up the ""finished product"" for a fair value for money and not to high expectations anymore.I don't worry for Civilization 6 because of a great fan-base of dedicated modders who will for sure, once the modding tools get released, do a great job and make this game shine in future, as they always did.I really wish well for the Civilization franchise, and I honor the 25 years of Civilization, so I decided this to be my 1st review of more to come."

If you thought missiles weren't fun, then this is a great game for you! If you thought that Civ 5 was too hard to play and the AI was too smart, then this is the game for you. Everything dumbed down. This has the complexity of a mobile game with the price of a desktop. What a waste.There are some frustrating gameplay omissions from Civ 6 which were present in Civ 5. I have listed some of them and also suggested several features which would be nice to include on a new game. The most frustrating is the technology tree essentially ending at Cold War era tech and not even progressing to the modern era. There's nothing new and exciting about this game, if anything it's Civ 5 with less features.You should be improving upon Civ 5, not removing units & gameplay. There are units which are implied, but simply missing. There should also be no excuse for not including MODERN Military units Example:•Missiles (for Missile Cruiser, Nuclear Sub, etc.)•Stealth Bombers (why is the highest bomber unit a B-52, this is unacceptable)•Stealth Fighters•Multiple Warhead ICBM's•Two tiers of Carriers, Nuclear Powered, and not. More air units in the modern carrier•Marines•Paratroopers•A-10 Ground attack aircraftMissing feature(s) which were essential to gameplay:•Airdrops•Automation of workers was nice, but I can understand the changeSuggestions for future units:•Missile Company•Floating Fortress (1984 style)•Mechwarrior future infantry•Hover Tanks•read a sci-fi novel and get imaginativeSeriously though unless I missed something, how is my civilization able to goto outer space, but they can't figure out how to have paratroopers."

It was a great game to just casually waste time and think of new and inventive strategies that would enable your empire to the number 1. Unfortunately for Civilization VI, even Robbie Rotten can't teach you how to be number 1. Civ VI adds a lot of new ideas that change the way you look at a Civilization game compared to Civ V, but most of them fall flat.Pros:-The Graphics are greatly improved upon compared to the previous entry. It has a distinct cartoonish artstyle that suits the game well.-Districts. The district system is one of the few new systems that actually works well. It adds more variety to all of your cities, and allows them to make up for shortcomings due to placement. However, each district requires a certain amount of population, and for each district you make, the cost of the next one goes up.-Civic Tree. This system replaces the policies of Civ V. It works much the same as the tech tree, but with culture instead of science. You can unlock units, buildings, policies and new governments through this, and it adds alot more depth to the game.-Pacing. Due to the system of Eureka moments, granting you a boost to a certain technology or civic, you can discover new things far too quickly for your cities to keep up. It is a great idea, but it is implemented poorly.-Religion. Religion in Civ VI is the worst thing about this game. You are forced to make religious units to combat other religious units. There is no penalty for attacking the units with other religious units, and you cannot capture them with normal units. You can't even attack them with normal units without being at war. The aforementioned religious units will affect the religion of nearby cities based on the outcome of these religious engagements. This would not be a problem if you could attack the units with your own. It also takes far too many spreads to convert any city to your religion, regardless of wether or not it had a religion to begin with.-Balance. When playing Civ VI you have a choice of 4 civs: you can pick from Rome, Germany, China, and Poland(if you have the DLC). There is no reason to choose any other civ unless you are specifically going for achievements. These 4 civshave bonuses that completely unbalance the game in their favour.-UI. Civ V's UI was elegant and easy to understand. Civ VI's UI is a cluttered, complicated mess.- The Minimap is all but useless. It is far too small and offers little information. Cities are portrayed by large squares inthe territory, which block most of the already limited view you have.- Religious view is just about as annoying as the rest of the religious system. When you try to move your religious unit, a filter is placed over your screen. It makes tiles affected by your religion white. When this is active you cannot see where your unit can go, because the movement indicators are a very similar light blue colour.-Movement. Civ V's movement system was fine. It worked. Civ VI's is annoying. there have been countless times where your unit has 1 movement point left, but it cannot move because of the terrain around it. You expect it to just end that unit's turn automatically because it has nowhere to go. but you will have to come back to that unit and tell it to skip it's turn. The same goes for roads. If my unit has 0.25 of a movement left, it should end the turn. In Civ V your turn ended if you went into rough terrain, like a hill or forest, because it used up all your movement points. In Civ VI you can move one tile normally, still have 2 movement points left, and no be able to go on a hill, forcing you to either go around or end your turn without using up all of your movement.In conclusion, Civ VI makes some very large strives in the name of innovation, but as with all innovation, most of it falls flat on it's♥♥♥♥♥ Maybe it will be up to par with Civ V after some much needed patches and DLCs to fix the many issues.This passage of time is what allowed for Civ V to be so great. In it's current state however, it is an unintuitive, overly complicated mess of a game. Only buy this if you are a hardcore Civilization fanatic."

HOW?!I spent my anticipation for Civ6 playing Civ5, which I like a lot, so my review is going to be mainly based on comparison to it.Start off with the good things:Districts system. It's a very good approach to have a new way of city management in Civ series.A lot of Micromanagement. At first it seems too much, but then you get used to it. I love tweaking.Now to the bad things:I dedicate whole paragraph to this concentrated essence of as*holery, programmed to ruin your day.The first two times I played the game, I wasn't really paying attention to AI behavior because I was busy figuring out new things and because I thought AI couldn't be worse than in Civ5. I was wrong.In short. The AI is very dumb, full of double standards and forces you into military play style.Yesterday before the patch I played as Norway on Prince difficulty (In Civ5 I played on Emperor pretty well). I founded a settlement on the coast next to the borders of city-state Kabul and another city not too far off. After 3 turns I come across Russian warrior who seemed like a nice guy. 15-20 turns later Peter conquers all nearby city states. (No way you could have an army capable of capturing a city state so early in Civ 5). So I was moving around my units my own borders and Peter tells me I should move them away. In 3 turns he declares a war and he has a sh*tload of Horses. Luckily thanks to dumb AI tactics with units and good production I made enough units to match his powers. I was liberating Kabul from his occupation, but at that time Peter already had 4 of his own cities and 2 conquered city states. When he knew I was almost done, he offered some sh*tty exchange for Peace treaty. Only after I liberated Kabul did I agree to them.I already knew the AI is dumb so I kept army not far from his capital, which was swarming with barbarians due to low amenity after war. Neverthess, he brings a bunch of Apostles and destroys my religion. This was the last drop, I conquered all of his cities and in the end liberated one city-state. Yet still everyone except Scythia called me a warmonger. Not simply called me once, they keep spamming this ALL the time I play. .Next, how in the hell can AI on Prince difficulty have EVERYTHING better than me?? Army 3 times bigger, far advanced science, religion and culture?It's okay, Classic and Medieval times according to history were indeed full of war, but there's no way to explain how AI can develop that far in such a short time. This is not a real challenge! I feel like developers were just lazy to write good tactics for AI and just multiplied score points by 3.Now, I've just played the game with a new patch and AI... AI never changes.I was on a lonely island enjoying peace when I met ships of Aztecs and Norway sailing by. Guess what? In 5-10 turns they declared war on me for no reason, . They sent troops from their islands to screw me up. 5-7 units from each side, while I had 1 warrior and 1 scout. Even if I wanted, I wouldn't be able to have an army equal to theirs by that time. And along with the army, all of the tiles in their territory were improved. Impossible! This game is simply imbalanced in terms of AI.This was when I gave up and decided not to play Civ 6 until it gets better. I hope..."
158,140.8,Not Recommended," September 16, 2017",8,"Most of the other reiews already say it, but this game is a massive letdown. While it has plenty of fun mechanics that have been revamped from civ 5, such as the new wonder system, the game all around does not compete with it's predecessor, especially in terms of the DLC policy. This game has been out for nearly a year now, and all the people who bought the Digital Deluxe edition feel scammed. Why? Because unlike civ 5, which was pumping out a plethora of great dlc, that expanded the mechanics and added more civs for reasonable prices in nearly every one, we are getting severely overpriced civilization packs, that include underwhelming civilizations, with no clear priority on the more important or interesting ones throughout history. A lot of people hated the Poland DLC, because all it added was a civ, but I felt it was well needed, however, later in the DLC line, we have gotten nothing but scenarios and civilzations. We have Australia, which is an underwhelming choice for a civ, as they have only been independant for about a hundred years. I could forgive this, however afterwards, rather than releasing an in depth, well made dlc, they made a dual pack with Persia, and for some reason Greece for a third time. That's right folks, Greece is in this game 3 times, but it's ok because Alexander's greece is ""Macedon"". And lastly, we have the Nubia DLC, which adds Nubia, an extremely vague, and odd choice for a civilzation in a game that is missing some of the most historically rich countries in history, such as the Netherlands, Portugal, Sweden, and Austria. Even though I do have 140 hours in the game, and have forced myself to have a positive outlook, on it, the DLC is making me more and more pessimistic by the release. Absolutely not worth the $80 I spent on the digital deluxe. Only consider getting this game if heavily on sale."

I had issues with Civ V when it came out, but the DLC made me appreciate it much more....this one, however....ungh. The AI is inconsistent at best- a civilization will declare war on you randomly, and then when you defend yourself you get the Warmonger label. Barbarians run rampant, and without the workshop add-on that gives normal experience for them all you're doing is wasting units (Yes, the barbarians will gang up on you if you get near an encampment). Productivity of cities seems to be random, with districts and buildings improving it sometimes and sometimes not appreciably. During your turn you REALLY need to pay attention to unit movement- when one unit has completed its actions, the game will move to the next unit..but SURPRISE!!! it may then go to another unit on the opposite side of the map- I can't count the times that I moved military units way out of position because I thought I was moving a settler or builder. I've played the Civ series since the start...some have been better than others. This one...no. Just, no. It has so many promising concepts, but while each piece may be great, the whole is less than the sum of its parts. Horribly disappointing."

147,9.3,Not Recommended, January 5,10,"In my limited gameplay I haven't experienced the weird AI that many people complain about. My problems with this game are the core gameplay and the changes that were made to it.Using traders to build roads seems like a nice concept, but I liked having workers set up my own personal routes to help me traverse my kingdom. Also, whoever thought of turning workers into 3 use builders made an egresious error in my opinion. I would gladly take workers taking a few turns to build an improvement rather than having 3 use workers.When it comes to districts I think they are a cool idea, and they definently add something to civilization, but they really take away from the experience in my eyes. It limits your playstyle since the ammount of districts you can make it proportianite to your land and population. In the past I like to do a few mega cities, stacked with wonders and buildings, but this iteration makes it so you basically have to branch out and have many cities.I have no real gripes with combat. Every civ is a little bit different when it comes to combat, and I haven't really found any major issues with how it is carried out in this one.Religion seems more annoying. In civ V I could more or less brush it off and manage to keep my cities with my own, but in this game it feels like if I am not 100% on top of my religious game I will get taken over by other civilization's religion.I actually like how city-states are done. The envoy system really freshens them up and offers players to win over the bonuses without just giving them an endless supply of gold.Overall, there are some interesting things in Civ VI, but when it comes down to core gameplay I just don't enjoy it as much as I have in previous versions."
195,9.5,Not Recommended, January 8,10,"I hate to say this about a Civilization game, but I can't recommend this one at all. I strongly recommend either Civ V Game of the Year Edition, or even one of the earlier versions. I've started multiple games, and I've quite frankly gotten bored. There is no ""Just one more turn!"" feeling here.The Good- Some fantastic new music.- An attempt at refreshing the whole series, not just copy-pasting a previous game with better graphics.- Civilizations are more unique and focused.The Bad- Everything is a bit more complex, a bit slower, and a bit more tedious than in previous games, but for no benefit to the gameplay. Want to build an upgraded spearman? OK, research this technology, then this civic, then build this military district on a different tile than your home city, then build a barracks, then build the spearman. It gets worse.- The maps are muddled, clogged up messes after two-three hours.- Movement and combat is painfully slow. City-states now have tons of units moving around, as well. And changing it to instant reduces your chance of seeing what is going on.- Religion is now a new type of war, basically. Churn out attack priests and defensive nuns and then preach each other to oblivion. And if you get converted? Game over. Because countries with the same religion have never fought each other before.........- Many, many changes only for the sake of being different.- Childish graphics, repetitive (but good) soundtrack, silly animations- It's just not fun.The Ugly- The cartoony ""strategic"" view.- The quotes are TERRIBLE, and not inspirational in the least. They literally took an intern and just Googled quotes. Many are from completely unknown bloggers, or lame attempts at humor, or worse. I'm not sure what they were thinking...

I feel much like I did with the Beyond Earth one … bored. I hope they fix a lot of things, because I only played a few games when Beyond Earth was released and deleted it a few days a later (reinstalled a few weeks ago, but couldn’t play an hour before deleting it again.) Civ 6 is looking like a good candidate for that.So the first thing I notice is that I can’t modify my civilization / ruler name and can’t rename cities. This bothers me a lot. I know not everyone feels that way, but I recall that always being an option. I would rather lead the people rather than a leader that the company selected for me. I mean they allow you to customize the religion so why not the other stuff? I remember playing hot seat with my brother with Civ 2, 3 and 4 all the time and we both did it. The other thing I noticed was the lack of map options. Seriously I can’t stand city states and I want them off, and I know I am not the only one that feels that way. I also noticed that I couldn’t even set how many of them popped up. So I started and had one right north of me, south of me and two my west. East was water so I am sure if it wasn’t there would be another there.Here are a few notes (and these are my opinions not an attempt at insulting anyone):1. Terrible AI!a. The AI can’t seem to take my cities even when they are barely defended and swarmed by the AI units. They also can’t defend cities very well.b. Unescorted settlers keep coming to my border. “Thanks, again for the free city!” I swear the last game on a standard map I build 4 or 5 cities from settlers I captured. I wasn’t even looking they just popped up near my units!c. Diplomacy is like playing Axis and Allies with a bunch of ten year olds. So instead of playing nice I found that domination was the way to go.d. Strange expansion. Cities all over the place or settling places that is rather poorly suited for a city.e. Barbarians are tougher than the nations!2. Districts Fail!a. Nice idea, but it just makes building take even longer. I get they want to force people to specialize cities, but it doesn’t work in my opinion. This was really something right out of the Endless Legend game which isn’t installed on my computer anymore; it didn’t work for that and I don’t see it working for Civ without major changes.b. They look terrible. If they are built next to the city center can it look like the city and blend together? To add to the terrible look the trade route roads get really messy especially playing as Rome. (and borders are terrible)c. The cost scaling is harsh. I don’t understand that just because one city has a port then why does it cost more for the next city to build one? If history went with this then the US would never have left the eastern seaboard!3. Wonders – not feeling it.a. Them being outside of cities doesn’t always make sense. Some don’t justify needing the entire square because they are not really that big. Pyramids I understand, but Eifel Tower, an opera house taking up essentially the same space as a metro downtown?b. They are pretty weak. That is a lot of time spent making something that just doesn’t have much impact especially since I take up some usable plot of land.4. Civilian units get more expensive for each one you buy / build. I can’t fathom why it should matter that because one city built some improvements that another city would have to pay more. This really slows down the empire building aspect of the game I like. It took so long that I decided to just send my Army on the war path and forget all those fancy things like farms, mines and luxury … that stuff is for the weak.5. Build queue? Why is this thing missing? I mean does it make sense that when the crap hits the fan that the city says, “No sir you can’t train a slinger, we are building a cultural district that will be ready in a few centuries and we can’t stop working on it for anything.” My response .. “Uh, you want to tell the barbarians at the gate that?” Iknow in previous Civs I used it a lot. Usually when I needed to churn out troops because Nuclear Ghandi has decided that he wants my land so I need to pause all construction and focus on a war economy. I know that sounds like fantasy and that stuff never happens in history.6. Border growth … how long and which tile is coming up. Oh and why do borders take so long to grow?There is probably more (UI, and confusing unit scroll), but I think that is enough of a list. I know when 5 came out there were a lot of issues and they worked it out, but still needed a lot of work. I am now debating if I will play 6 again or wait for some fixes. I know it sounds silly, but being able to name the ruler, civ and cities is the one that doesn’t make me want to play. So what if I want to be Gozer the Gozerian of Gozeria? Oh, this had better be in a patch, if they make us pay for it then I am done with Firaxis games, after all the game was expensive enough."

Within this short time period, Mac users will only be able to play other Mac users.”For the first few weeks my PC had the “Winter 2016” update and her Mac did not have that update available yet.

9,102.3,Not Recommended," October 24, 2017",14,"This game could have been a masterpiece but it was ruined by 3 major issues. I will start by listing the problems and then give an example of how they spoil the game.Artificial ""Intelligence""By far the biggest problem with the game is the AI or lack of it. It completely ruins the game. It should be the most developed part of the game and central to everything, but it makes the game unplayable.The bad AI makes diplomacy impossible so I don't bother with it in the game. The other leaders act completely at random. One turn they're your mate, the next turn they denounce you.AI military tactics are non-existant. They couldn't fight their way out of a wet paper bag.Inevitabley the AI will declare war on you at some point. You are then branded a warmonger for defending yourself. When you come to make peace, the AI will give an excessive amount away to make peace and totally take them out of the game.City placement is not thought out. Middle to late game the AI will pop a city right on the corner of a continent squeezed in between two of your cities with access to no water and possible one amenity if they're lucky. Completely pointless.When you take a city of the AI, it's often not developed and needs work.In most of the games I've played one civilization is always overpowered and wins a cultural victory with 200 turns to spare. This often means I have to declare war on them to reign then in a bit, this then leads to being a warmonger.It's clear the AI hasn't been well developed and it's the worst part about the game.Although there have been some additions to the game I like, such as districs and wonder placements. This is outweighed by other issues with the game mechanics.How can a crossbow corps inflict damage on a tank?Why does it take 50 years of an infantry unit to cross my territory?Why does it take over 100 years to build an aerodrome?Why do cities keep growing to the point where their surroundings cant sustain them and they run out of amenities and houising?The majority of cities I have will always run out of amenities in middle to late game and there's only so much one can do to resolve it. JUST STOP GROWING.It takes far too long to the ""other players"" turns to be calcualted and taken. It makes the games drag. This has always been an issue in other civiliziation games I have played. Why is this still an issue on the 6th installment?Clearly the person who developed the UI has never played this game, or any game like it. It makes the game so annoying.I am interrupted every turn by leaders denouncing me or whatever. The game has to show me 10 seconds of Ghandi kicking off at me? why? I don't care. Stop interrupting my game play. Luckily there is a mod to cut these screens down.When I make a trade deal with another civilization, My delegate informs me that I have just made a trade deal. Seriously?The screen overflows with useless and annoying information about every little thing that's going on in the world.It's a terrible UI.Game is steady away. I am around mid table score. By pereclies of Greece wins a culture victory before we reach 300 turns out of 500. Nothing I could have done to stop this realistically. I couldn't build up a big enough army in time to take some cities off him and affect his culture. If the AI was decent, they would have seen he was going to win and all attacked him to balance the game out.Anyway, I continue to play for a bit. Throughout the game I was denounced every other turn by at least one civilization because I had a different governement to them. The only person who was ok was Ghandi.At this point I had not declared any war on anyone or had a war declared on me.Suddenly, Japan attacks one of my city states. I declare a war of protectorate on Japan with a warmonger penalty of ""none"". Anyway, next turn Ghandi denounces me as a warmonger..... as does someone else I can't remember.I protect my city state and seriously weaken Japan's army but don't touch their cities.When I come to make peace with Japan, I take around 5 cities off his hands at the negotiating table as well as gold.I now gain 5 cities which all need work as Japan had done a crap job.Japan now has around 4 cities left and a weak army. Not longer after we made peace. Japan and Ghandi both declare war on me. Bear in mind ghandi hates war and people who declare war. This is seriously messed up. I end up decimating Japan as they have no army and they are out of the game.Ghandi is on the other side of the continent to me and poses no real threat. He sends about 5 medievil era units to one of my cities (I am in the information era) and they are quickly dealt with. We come to negotiate peace and he gives me the city of mumbai! How is 5 medievil land units worth a full city with several districs?The game makes no sense and is completely unpredictable.I don't think I will be buying Civ 7."

26,169.5,Not Recommended," November 13, 2016",83,"A little bit of background. I've played Civ-Civ VI. I've played Alpha Centauri and Civ BE. I'm trying to like this game, but as it is now, I'm thinking of uninstalling it.The Cons have been said ad naseum (bad AI, mid to late game slow down, random unit selction, ect...) So I'll add my two cents.First no matter what size map and no matter the difficulty, the game insists on putting a ton of AI civs directly next to you. As I got sick of AI civs next to me, my new strategy is to take their territories ASAP. (Please note: I don't want a domination victrory). In the latest game, by turn 21 I had an American scout, Russian scout, and Brazilian scout show up. I kill off Washington (about 15 tiles away, mind you, on a huga map), then Russia and Brazil declared war on me. I take them both out by 860AD. But, Norway has this huge army. So I know how bad this game is for AI city spam and I ask them to stop settling near me. They say OK. Then they spawn a city between two of my existing citites. As China I was superior in technology against their warrior horde (I had many promoted units), but why keep playing? Domination isn't fun for me and yet I'm being forced into that playstyle. Can we please stop having AI next to each other every game? There are 5 AI civs next to me, yet other parts of the world are largely empty. No thanks.Second: Informtaion notifications need a bit of a overhaul. I'm having trouble seeing what ameneities and housing are needed. We still have the issues of auto explore with units who will happliy walk into 3 AI units before calling my attention to it. These same units will stop 3 tiles away fromt he goody huts. Make it so units within three tiles warn you of AI enemies. I could go on, but I think you get the drift.Bouns issues!City states spam units and just move them around endlessly. Maybe give us some IRL time per turn back by just having them fortify unless they have a need to move.Why the hell does the AI spam so many religious units? They are ultra aggressive in spreading their religions. Also on the lowest levels they seem to be able to spam missionaries and apostles in mass quantites. This needs to be fixed.Conclusion:At this stage of the product, I think you should hold off for a patch. There are a few bright points, but IMO, it's a ton of frustration right now."
490,228.1,Not Recommended," October 22, 2016",949,"Is the game bad ? No.Is it better that Civ V was at the moment of its release ? Yes.Does it have great potential ? Absolutely.But right now, the game is plagued by constant, eternal, stupid reccuring wars for the simple reason that the AI is batshit crazy. Turn 100 on the easiest difficulty settings, I had already been declared war 7 times. To no avail, since the Ai doesn't know how to lead a war, despite not producing anything but military units since the beginning of the game.My advice ? Wait six months for the game to be heavily patched. And if it isn't, simply don't buy it.**************EDIT 10/31/2016******************Turns out the AI is even worse that I thought. It tends to be insanely agressive on the lowest difficulty levels, simply because you leading the game and not having the most powerful army always lead one or several nations to attack you, no matter how senseless and how desperate the assault is. This actually makes the game harder at easiest difficulty levels, but that's not even the worst.I'm finishing a game on ""prince"" difficulty, on a large ""central sea"" map. The ting is, the IA simply do not know how to expand. The biggest AI empire must be 8 cities large, while mine is the double without even waging any war. 2/3 OF THE LAND MAP IS ♥♥♥♥ING EMPTY, simply because the AI apparently never thought about expanding to the huge, fertile, mineral-rich empty lands everywhere. And before you ask: no, this is not Civ V, there is no actual penalty to a great empire. Makes the game INSANELY easy."

I was a loyal fan, been so since the dawn of Civilization-series and it really saddens me to see that while Civ 6 would have been a decent game with just graphics update from previous games, the developers failed even that and made it a lot worse game.My advice, go buy Civ 4 or Alpha Centauri if you want to play a good game in this genre, do not give money over a product that is costly and still un-finished after countless months and patches."
353,57.0,Not Recommended," October 23, 2016",185,"For all its new bells and whistles, Civilization VI isn’t all that different from Civilization V. Gameplay elements introduced in Brave New World, such as Tourism and trade routes, make a return while new elements like the Civics tree and AI agendas provide new challenges and opportunities for playing the game of history. It’s a shame that Civilization VI is so fundamentally flawed that these new elements feel ill thought out, and basic mechanics are suddenly far more clunky and annoying than before. As of right now, at launch, I would not recommend Civilization VI.Civilization VI is undoubtedly a very pretty game, especially when there aren’t any battles being fought. The level of detail is some of the greatest I’ve seen in a 4X, with your city centers growing and evolving with the technological era and units looking civilization-appropriate. The strategic map is gorgeous; the colors are bright and vibrant while the terrain and resource drawings are lush with detail. The leader portraits and animations, as well as the victory movies, are very pretty and much more satisfying than Civ V’s stiff images and animations.Unfortunately, Civilization VI doesn’t know how to pace itself. Researching technologies and civic policies is simply too fast. Part of the problem is that the standard Civilization tech tree is now split in two, and researching both at once causes you to advance at a far faster pace than your economy can take advantage of. With the new Eureka mechanic, it’s astonishingly easy to start researching Future Tech before you get your first nuclear weapon.Resource yields from tiles, improvements, and buildings are so ♥♥♥♥♥rdly that you’ll probably spend most of your time focusing on gold or faith so you can just buy everything instead of wasting dozens of turns building them. I suspect the decision to make buildings give flat yield bonuses was so that policy cards and strategically placing districts and wonders would have greater impact on the gameplay, but it was a dumb decision because production now takes forever, meaning you can easily skip over entire eras of buildings and units and end up with Crossbowmen and Jet Fighters in the same war.And even if you buy an army, moving units is far more difficult than it needs to be. Often times you’ll be told your unit lacks the movement to go up a hill or through woods, and no unit can cross a river tile if they had moved previously in the turn, no matter how much spare movement they have. It slows exploration and warfare down tremendously, and it shouldn’t surprise you if you cannot uncover a full Standard-sized world before you reach the Atomic Era and get access to the Earth Satellite national project which reveals the entire map. It doesn’t help that you can’t build roads without an expensive unit, making moving within your own empire just as difficult as moving in the wilderness.The end result is that Civilization VI feels both very slow and very fast. You’ll race through history, snatching up technologies and civics far ahead of the AI, but struggle to build an empire as your production queue bottles up thanks to low yields, even with helpful civic cards. You could easily, and will probably be forced to, bypass most unit and building choices to focus on achieving one victory condition. And in a single-player game, it will probably feel like a completely undeserved victory.The single-player AI is terrible. There’s no other word for it. It can’t make strategic city placement choices, it can’t match a player in terms of technology or civics, it can’t even fight a war despite outproducing most players in terms of units because all it does is throw outdated, obsolete units into range of your cities and wait for you to kill them. And in every game, there is at least one AI player that thinks it’s a city-state and focuses on pumping out units to protect its capital, even if it produces a settler. It’s a terrible AI, and the only way it could possibly be competitive is by cheating at yields to increase production, but since it would still make terrible strategic choices it would still be a horribly easy opponent.Surprisingly, early-game Barbarians are more of a threat than the AI civilizations. By default, they behave like Raging Barbarians in Civ V. They keep the Ancient and Classical Eras interesting to play through if you can’t find other civilizations to pound on. It’s a shame that they never improve though, and it’s a hassle to find that they continue to spawn outside owned tiles throughout the game since they’re just a nuisance by Medieval.Speaking of owned tiles, spreading your borders is incredibly slow and the art for districts and improvements is disappointing. You’ll never see an Endless Legend-like conurbation, densely packed with buildings and sprawling across entire regions. Everything will be squeezed together, and it will look like a small town until it suddenly springs skyscrapers in the Modern Era, amidst fields and mines and wonders. Culture growth is slow no matter what you build, and even now I’m not entirely sure what causes borders to spread. You’ll always be wondering whether you should cannibalize an improvement or resource, or spend gold to expand. This is probably to balance the fact that cities now sprawl out over all tiles, so that you have to focus individual cities down to a few districts, but it means your empire will rarely expand to an impressive scale.A lot of Civilization VI’s new mechanics aren’t explained, even if you set the advisor level to “New to Civilization VI” in the options menu. Besieged a city? Great; why and for what purpose? So defenses and defenders don’t heal, but nothing explains it, not even the Civopedia. Not enough amenities for your city? You have no idea where they went and little idea which ones they’re benefitting from. Civilization VI holds your hand through the most basic mechanics, but won’t explain any of the more complex ones it introduces.The UI is a major factor in obscuring information useful to the player. While it is a little cleaner than Civ V’s, it gets rid of a lot of information and shortcuts to more detailed information. Wondering how many amenities you have and if you can trade any of them away? There’s no list of them. Trying to see the attack range of your ranged units? Unless an enemy is actually in range you can’t see it or see the effect of any terrain on it. Getting told your cities are getting unhappy because you’re lacking amenities? The actual information as to why and the rate at which they are approaching rebellion is hidden behind several buttons because the devs didn’t want it cluttering up your city screen.Actually building things in your cities, telling your trade units to move between cities or start new trade routes, and even switching between selected units is a chore. Buttons for lists and views are spread to all four corners of the screen, forcing players to focus on all the farthest corners if you need more detailed information. And most of the information is too wordy and dismayingly uninformative. It’s hidden away because it clutters the screen, but most of it is so much empty numbers and statistics that finding the data relevant to you in any given turn is more difficult than waging a war.People say that vanilla Civilization V was a mediocre, stripped down game compared to Beyond the Sword Civilization IV. I actually enjoyed vanilla Civ V, and the expansions only made it better. Vanilla Civilization VI is a legitimate mess. The AI is like a child, the UI is a chore, and the game’s mechanics actively fight you when they’re not hidden and unclear. And that’s without touching on the game’s sense of humor, which injects itself into every sequence of text longer than seven words. It might or might not be to your liking, much like the game itself. But I would say it’s not worth the price."
226,104.7,Not Recommended, January 7,48,"The whole game is designed to annoy.The AI is constantly sending you random messages.It denounces and declares war right after they signed a trade agreement, because the trade made them rich enough to look down on you ... resulting in the trade agreeement being cancelled, the AI not being rich enough anymore and then easily accepting a peace offer as soon as you touch a single thing in their posession.A child could trick the AI.Also the game starts off with unskippable eardrums busting trademark lineups that you have to break in the game files so they don't play anymore.The game plays like a chess game, not like an empire builder.While that might be totally fine for other players, I was looking for immersion, not for tic-tac-toe.Previously the game took pride in using quite interesting quotes from intersting people of the past, but now the brightest of quotes comes from Monty Python.The game's speed can only be manipulated as a whole and is not designed to work, but to be modded away on day1.On marathon the game balance just breaks completely.It takes between 30 and 90 turns to make a military unit if your city isn't super focused on production, making it impossible to create backup during a war thorugh production, shifting the game balance towards ""gold is the way to go"" and to ""expect there is no backup"", making entire strategy-branches unplayable.Medieval ages and Rennaissance yet again pass too quickly and are not fleshed out, eventhough they're the most interesting.The aqueduct district cannot be placed at a river if that river is in the desert, which means you can't win the game if you start off in a desert biome.Auto-exploration is dumb as a brick.It prefers to reveal distant parts of the map instead of the proximity.When exploring an ocean, it leaves out entire portions of the ocean, wasting many many turns just to come back way later.The AI is also stupid in the matter of being unable to settle accross the ocean.I was already approaching industrial ages when I discovered an island that an AI player must have seen the whole time.They were having a hard time developing, because all space on the mainland was already occupied or useless.That island on the other hand was rich and valuable - but they never bothered to colonize it, because there were 2 tiles of coastal water inbetween. So much about colonial age.I like that they finally made the jump to 3D, but everything else about the game is just godawfully annoying."

I regret the time I had to put into this botched attempt at a Civ game in order to come to this conclusion.The first 100 or so turns seems cool, but as you progress it becomes apparent that there wasn't a lot of thought put into making the game compelling, but rather meeting deadlines. It just doesn't seem like the developers put much pride into this beyond the shallow and cosmetic. The mathematical underpinnings of the game are fundamentally flawed, and it shows through painfully once a game gets going. I got bored before way I won or lost every game, because nothing seemed to matter. I have 966 hours logged on Civ 5, but I was bored with Civ 6 in under 50 hours.This game is a big step backward from Civ 5. I'm not into the mobile/WoW graphics like many others, but further there's a real feeling of laziness behind the graphic assets. There is no real variation between units or buildings of different cultures. Everything is uniform. China looks just like Mexico beyond the early game. It's homogenous, and that's disappointing for a game that costs $60 and supposedly celebrates all these various cultures and epochs. There are mods made by hobbyists for Civ 5 with more depth diversity. It's just shallow and very low-effort on the part of this supposed AAA studio.They subtracted a TON from Civ 5. For example my infantry went from musketeers in breastplates to WW2 troops to mech. They removed the United Nations, and replaced it with a diplomatic system that is impossible. Everybody will hate you, and if they don't it means they are about to declare war on you. The elegant diplomatic solution that made Civ 5 so interesting was just removed, as if they had made a mistake with Brave New World. The diplomacy is brutal and stupid.I do like some of the features like city districts and...well I do like the districts. The fog of war artwork they did is cool.The AI is so bad it might as well be totally random, which might actually be an improvement. It is so disappointing to be anticipating a big battle, only to have the enemy force disperse for no reason. I'm sitting here frustrated by an opposing army as if they were my own crew of ♥♥♥♥-ups. There's no sense of accomplishment in defeating an enemy that defeats itself. Almost every AI algorithm in the game is straight up broken, and that sucks when you put a bunch of effort into it for nothing.I would say save your money, and maybe buy it on sale, but even then I'd say save your time and invest it in a game of Civ 4 or 5. This is the junkfood of Civilization titles, and I'm really sad to have to write this negative review. Maybe it will mature with DLC, but after a week I'm playing Civ 5 again to scratch my empire building itch.I dunno, maybe since Civ has gone ESPORTZ I should play some multi-player stuff before reaching a conclusion. Playing against the computer is just too dumb for this to be a PVE game on par with its precessors."

286,133.8,Recommended," June 23, 2017",11,"TL:DR= AI might aggrivate you (Details below) but this game is worth your time and is very enjoyable with several new features that have never been in a previous Civ title. (Try the free demo if you are unsure)Full Review:I have played every iteration of Civilization ever published, including the branch off games (Civ Revolution, and Civilization: Call to Power) and I think that this is an excellent entry in the series. Don't let some of the most recent user reviews sway you, this is a great game. The biggest thing i've seen in the negative reviews seem to be some sort of backlash over DLC prices, but that doesnt make a game bad since the game is plenty good enough without any of the DLC.The other more legitimate complaint i've seen is that the AI is poor and will declare war for no reason. This is both true and untrue. The AI Civs have certain agendas and working against their agenda will earn you their ire. WHich i think is a better mechanic than Civ 5's AI that was just trying to win the game and would go hostile toward you if you were getting close to achieving a victory condition. The AI in civ 6 is more of what I would call Role playing AI and will act like a certain personality would act and will be slightly more predictable IF you know all the factors about their agenda which requires some intel and diplomatic ties.In fairness to the detractors though, some of the AI agenda items can be a bit nonsensical, such as hating anyone who has more luxuries than them. Odd agenda items can cause a previous ally to become distant or even hostile over what might seem like a minor issue to our modern sensibilities. However i think if you look at history you'll find that Civilizations went to war constantly over the most inconsequntial issues simply cause one side had something the other wanted. Deciding if the AI's touch and go loyalty is a deal breaker will have to be up to you though if you are concidering getting the game.The AI issue is the only real legitame con I see in this game. The rest of the game I think is done extremely well. The new district systems are very fun and adds a new layer of strategy to deciding where a city is going to go. Geography of the map becomes valuable as mountains provide faith and sciense, placing an industrial district surounded by coal or steel or other strategic resources can make a city a power house. Also the ability to build a harbor district means that you know longer are forced to have a city directly on the coast in order to have a navy. The whole thing add an entirely new set of factors to analyse and opens the door to many new strategies and different ways to play the game.I also enjoy the new religion mechanics and religious unit combat. The ability to win the game by spreading your religion around the world is entirely new and has a completely different feel than traditional conquest.The ability to link civilian units to combat units for protection is also a great quality of life feature.The way the new civics work also adds a good amount of customization to your play style. As you earn culture you will progress on the new culture tree (similar to the tech tree) and earn cards with different traits such as extra production of builders, or naval units, or land units. or extra gold and faith n the capital or +1 production in all cities, etc. There are a lot of them. Different government types will have different ammounts of military, civic, and wild card slots so depending on your government type and the cards you choose you can greatly vary the playstyle of your Civilization.All in all despite a couple of hiccups on the AI end I think this is an excellent game that the vast majority of Civ fans would enjoy, and if you have never tried a Civilization game but enjoy grand strategy or 4x as a genre you need to try this game.If you arent convinced there is a free demo for you to try out the game.If you got this far thank you very much for taking the time to read my post and I hope you enjoy the game!"

The AI is erratic as hell - I've had three unexpected declarations of war against me by two separate AI players (I won them all) and yet apparently I'm the warmonger. Hmmm.In addition to this, the latest war I won saw me demanding a city from one of the other players as part of the peace dividend - and I find it occupied with soldiers WAY in advance of my own, yet the AI never used them in battle against me. Weird huh?The district thing is very cool but it just seems like a way to slow down city/empire expansion even more - e.g. I can't build a barracks without first building an entire military district in a city, and some of the sub-buildings you can construct are mutually exclusive in each city (why?!).Some of the movement concepts are literally the reverse of those in Civ 5 - a perfectly good game and the pinnacle of the series, for me - and I don't know why they would do that except to mess with the player.And despite winning every conflict, one of the AI players is two eras ahead of me. I just don't get it. I'm playing this thing by the book, haven't put a foot wrong and yet I'm apparently unable to get ahead of any other civilisation despite everything I have going in my favour.

With every gold producing tile worked and zero units i still got negative income from my cities, despite all policies focused on gold production. I can't even build a unit to go to the other continent and try to kill any unit from the opposite civilization to force them a peace agreement and there is no option to ask for peace in the diplomacy menu. Any units i produce just get disbanded from bankruptcy half way to the other continent. This is just completely broken!So I need to support the other downvoters here with my own - I am not recommending this game, it can't be played completely and fun because no mather how successfull you are - the game can screw you beyond revovery any moment.Such game breaking things need to be fixed ASAP - escpecially considering the high cost of this game, it is actually 2-3 times more expensive than most of my other games."

Until then, don't pay for this."
186,48.1,Recommended," October 20, 2016",5,"If you're looking at reviews to determine whether or not you'll buy this game, I'd suggest instead moving to youtube and looking up videos of people playing it for the first time. This game is complicated. I myself have played Civ V extensively and even then, this game is still a little confusing for me to start with. People that have played grand strategy games previously will be able to pick this game up and get into it relatively quickly, but new players might want to take their time and really consider whether they are willing to dive into this deep, dark enigma of civilization management.If you're looking at reviews for opinions on mechanics and such, then let's talk about that a little in not any particular order.+ Main Menu is easy to use with a catchy background score that might even have you stopping for a moment to simply enjoy it!+ Setting up games and utilising mods/DLC is streamlined for efficiency and ease-of-use.+ Game works well on Ultra settings with my rig; GTX 970 + i7 Processor.+ Sean Bean's narration is exceptional. Thankfully he doesn't die in this game!+ Movement and Combat animations are pleasant to watch. The sped up variations are also nice.+ Multiple tech trees to explore simultaneously; Actual Technology and Civics! The design of each boasts a high level of individuality, depth and unique paths that one can forge for themselves. Very easy to play differently every game.+ Civ personalities are much more pronounced in this game and their triggers are more relevant; some civs will dislike you talking to city states while others will make your people wish you'd never warred with them in the first place as some examples.+ Map is beautiful to view, strategic view also quite pleasant and informative. The difference between them is not as large as it was in Civ V, allowing people to utilise it more frequently and easily without the jarring differences.+ Districts allow you to enhance your cities uniquely and make the map seem less sporatic with cities and more akin to a real map which would house many different types of areas between cities and towns.+ New movement system that forces more logical thinking in terms fo both exploration and warring. With roads now only available once trade routes are utilised, it is much more important to consider positioning and reactionary thinking when choosing to war another civ or state.+ Influence over city states is now decided by Envoys which are given to you at a trickling pace, allowing for variety in your decision-making and giving you a much broader idea of how to distribute them out, along with the information of what other Civ's choices are.+ Barbarians have been reworked almost entirely, their new AI quick to identify weak Civs and send a raiding party into their lands. This rework forces players to adopt a more defensive or offensive structure to their early builds, not only making it more tense when deciding between building an additional warrior before a wonder but also giving you the initiative in creating a small force to defend from early warmongering Civs and players alike.+ Flat Happiness bonuses in Civ V have been replaced by Amneties, which is a combination of luxuries found across the world and quality-of-life buildings and civic policies that influence the growth rate of your citizens. This is now coupled with the Housing counter, which determines a cities maximum size relative to the cities current housing potential. Your cities will no longer grow infinitely without proper usage of buildings, civic policies and the terrain itself to keep them well fed, worked and sheltered.+ Very easy to get lost within your city management. A surplus of buildings, districts and other such things will always be nagging at the back of your mind. ""Damn, I really want a holy site. But I need a library too! But what if someone attacks me? I need an archer!"" Decision-making is once again given a broad area to work with, the player never lacking in things to do within their cities. (Though I have not gotten into the more modern eras just yet, this statement can only be made for up to Medieval eras.)+ New speed setting for multiplayer games, making it much easier to get into a lobby and get going without issue of having to spend hours upon hours in-game, wondering whether or not you'll be able to get these people back together for another session. This new setting is 100% speed bonus on everything, a 76.6% increase over Quick setting which is only 33.3%.+ In-game music is great!+ Natural wonders are now large enough to influence multiple cities, allowing you to build entire empires around them or utilise your border expansions to try and monopolise the entire area for a single city.+ Research boosts for both Technology and Civic research works perfectly. It is both rewarding for those that wish to follow a select path and thought-provoking for those that like to branch out at their own pace. Boosts are a solid 50% bonus toward the tech/civic, allowing you to research half of the desired selection and abandoning it for several turns to allow the boost itself to finish off the tech for you. Great design.+ Pillaging is no longer a flat boost to hp and gold, now somewhat randomized and influenced by what it is you're pillaging - allowing you to steal more than just gold. Faith, Science and Culture are some examples.+ Promotions for units are now unique to the unit type and they *actually matter*, as opposed to the same 3 or so promotions you were almost forced to use in Civ V.+ Build more than one scout. Trust me.+ Multiplayer Scenarios!+/- City management menus are not user-friendly. Its hard to find everything and what it does tell you is a little lackluster in terms of information. The civpedia is also not exceptionally helpful.+/- Your UI is not cluttered. This is great for those that prefer to find menus for their information and dislike seeing it on their primary screen. This is not great for those who are fine with a little clutter and who prefer to simply glance at specifcs without being forced to find it through menus.+/- Sped up variant of Combat and Exploratory movements still play sounds and do not appear to be muteable.+/- Tribal Villages (the new version of Ancient Ruins) are not easily identified visually, blending in with their surroundings too easily.+/- Still not much in the way of information on other Civs (pre-spy, as I haven't gotten there yet). You can still view their current luxuries, gold and some small information on their personalities but otherwise the diplomacy screen is lacking.+/- Tutorial tips are not well explained. Some features you will only understand through trial and error. Housing, for example, is influenced by whether a city is on a river or not. The game does not really give you a great understanding of this until later when you are actively trying to figure out why you don't have enough housing!+/- Amount of Civs to choose from is a little limited currently. This was fixed in Civ V with DLC, so this will probably be the case here too. This is made better by the very unique ways you can play each game, breathing life into each Civ beyond a single session.+/- Great People are limited. You are not going to definitely get one any more and I personally feel this is a step sideways. Yes, there is now more tactical use of these Great People and yes, it is more competitive between Civs in the recruitment of these Great People but I feel (haven't experienced) that this might influence players that are doing poorly to continue doing poorly in comparison to some of the top contenders.- Diplomacy is lacking.- ""What did that sound mean?""Things I haven't gotten around to yet, so I cannot comment on.= Religion= Eras beyond Medieval= Strategic resources= Naval= Victory conditions= Scenarios= MultiplayerTL;DRIt's great, buy it."
403,16.2,Recommended," October 21, 2016",5,Fantastic sequel to one of the best games ever made. It is not as huge a change as one might have expected but it adds enough to feel like a great follow up.
236,285.4,Not Recommended," October 29, 2017",5,"The game is Ok but has a lot of annoyances and flaws in core mechanics which Firaxis has shown very little initiative in addressing. Just as an example it took them over a year to make a trivially simple fix to sorting trades on the trade screen when filtering by yield types and another fix to show a notification when a city is able to bombard enemy units.Pros:-City planning is quite engaging due to districts and picking a good place for a city based on water availability, resource tiles, defensibility, and potential district adjacency bonuses (i.e. +1 yield per adjacent mountain) and wonder placements is one of the high points of the game for me.-Eurekas and Inspirations (you get 50% discount on techs if you meet certain conditions i.e. own 3 archers, kill unit with slinger) make planning tech and culture tree progression engaging and varied. As a result you will often end up advancing somewhat differently through the techs depending on your location, opponents and victory strategy.-Policy cards system is also engaging and offers a lot of opportunity to engage in planning on when to switch policies in order to reap their benefits (i.e. switching to military production boost for ships just before beefing up your navy)-Art assets make it much easier than before to identify tile improvements, terrain features, and units at a glance. I also personally enjoy the color palette and find it warm without being gaudy or overbearing.Cons:-While the UI is clean and legible at high resolutions, it is very bad at providing much of the information necessary to actively engage with certain game mechanics. For instance district placement only shows adjacency bonus rounded down and only when placing the district. There is no way to see maximum possible adjacency when deciding where to settle so you end up having to calculate the adjacency manually and only use the UI tooltip to verify your work. Every one of the new engaging mechanics is dragged down by the un-accommodating UI.-AI is miserable at handling the new mechanics. You will often see AI placing cities and districts in very questionable locations as if they are oblivious as to how district adjacency works. They don't seem to go for Eurekas and Inspirations either and it's not really possible to see if they use policy cards in any way other than completely randomly.-AI has zero ability to wage war effectively. Ok, they will try to surround your city with 5+ warriors on turn 25 on Deity but that is the peak of it's ability. It will concentrate its masses of horribly outdated units in some nonsensical region of the map while you easily siege down it's capital on the other side of the map with the requisite 4 units. Even worse is how it will sometimes ignore military completely after you wipe out their forces and take a couple cities. Overall the AI just fails at this critical aspect of the game.-The AI is crazy. Seeing a pattern here? Yeah the AI also cannot handle diplomacy in any sensible fashion. The idea of AI civ personalities and agendas is great but the implementation leaves a lot to be desired. A lot of times it does not work as intended and the AI behaviour comes off as arbitrary when it should be predictable and consistent. For example, my last diety game was a domination victory by 1520 AD (fairly standard settings - 8 civs, pangea, etc.) during which time Cleo whose agenda involves respect for a large military kept denouncing me due to a small army even as I took my third or fourth capital. To be fair she praised me once during that game after the 5th capital.-Lots of unjustifiable downtime. This one is also due in large part to the AI. The AI turns take somewhat too long (not unbearable) even on high end hardware. The more annoying part of this is that during AI turns they will liberally insult you or issue crazy demands, or praise you for not building wonders even as you siege down the captial of your fourth civ. These popups have an animation which takes entirely too long and cannot be skipped. Added together, AI turns can last over a minute and drive you mad especially if you are struggling against the astronomical bonuses AI get on high difficulty to compensate for their lack of ability to play the game.Conclusion:While the mechanics at the core of Civ 6 are well done and engaging, the AI and UI drag the whole game experience down too much to recommend. In a game where the focus is on singleplayer and thus necessitates playing against the AI, such an incompetent, slow, cheating, and inconsistent set of opponents combined with a generally irksome and unhelpful UI are unforgivable. Furthermore, the response from the developer in addressing issues has been entirely too slow and half hearted even when dealing with very simple problems. This is in contrast to a fair number of DLCs being released at very questionable price points ($5 for one civ and 60 turn scenario?)."
439,164.7,Not Recommended, January 5,7,"It's simply not a good Civilization game(yet at least prior to extra expansions).All victory conditions are about domination. Want to be science team? Capture enemy towns with academies. Culture? Go ravage those enemy towns because you do want to be cultured after all! What about empire size you ask? Well you could make small solid empire like in civ 5 with wonders, right!? Wrong! Wonders for most part don't do♥♥♥♥♥♥ They are very high risk with low reward. Building a wonder feels kinda like building granary in one of older games, except not anywhere near as strong and it will take waaaay longer and it will take slot from ground and they will have special terrain and resource requirements! See in Civ 6 wonders and districts are built on top of your tiles. Districts? Well these are like town sections that each boost different things(like academy for science, commercial hub for trade/gold and so forth) which are limited by your size and location(which gives different bonuses and decides how you will want to play the game for you!). The idea behind districts actually was pretty good IMO, sadly the execution was worse than horrible. The terrain combined with your start team completely dictates how you will play the game but then again since game is all about conquest I guess it doesn't matter which direction precisely you go for through conquest! Now I will say harbor district was well made, it gives you freedom to settle just near shore as opposed on the shore. Encampment(military district) was also another better district as it gives freedom rather than limits and shoehorns you too much. Wonders though which were biggest enabler for small empires really not a thing. They give low rewards, take tile yelds/resources they are built on top of and frankly you'll get much better stuff from districts to make wonders feel even more worthless. You could and should build/capture a huge empire like civ 4 as it will always be the best choice due to how strong districts, resources and basic buildings are. The biggest downfall of this strategy however is falling asleep from boredom.Did I mention this game has no puppet cities(civ 5) or automation(civ 4) so you get to manually do absolutely everything even with the most useless towns! No pesky building ques either so you can enjoy putting each and every teeny tiny little item to build manually(well mods have this but for some reason it still isn't in base game). Ohh yeah and you no longer need automated builders either, now you get to(read: you are forced to) manually build every teeny tiny little improvement and with limited build number you get to build more builders manually because we love to micro everything!Ohh and the lovely diplomacy. You get those lovely trade offers and demands and denounciations every so often. What's even better is you still get to see them in diplomacy screen directly so you get to tap exit for the first minute of every few turns as those dozen AIs keep making worse and worse offers for resource you did not want to trade prior and still do not want to trade. Or you could just trade it because saving yourself from that headache the bunch of diplomacy suggestions will give you. No more tech trading, map trading vasallages or anything like that either because less is more! And not to worry, the AI will still be crazy warmongers always declaring war on you with no chance of winning. You capturing a town or two will make you the warmonger so you get to be denounced by the whole world or some idiot AI will praise you for 60 turns till they declare war on you. Naturally the whole world will eventually declare war on you but you need not worry too much.The AIs strategic thinking is that of a toddler randomly moving different units generally into the worst possible locations. Naturally builders and archers are the best frontline you will ever need. They can then be backed up by the melee units followed by cavalry so everything that actually wants to fight at close range will be blocked. The AI is literally dumb as a box of rocks. It has no clue when it should send and what. Even on highest difficulties you can easily defend army 5 times your size for they are just lambs to slaughter when AI is in charge. The AI has no sense of terrain, chokes or target priority. The AI also fears hights, for that reason it keeps the air units tightly grounded in their hangars(it builds them, just doesn't use them)! I should mention that unit promotion options in this game are also very very limited compared to civ 4 and 5 so don't expect units to feel different from one another. One good thing I will say about civ 6 combat is the barbarians. They are hell of a lot bigger threat than all nations combined in early game. If you cannot stop a barbarian scout in time from reporting to camp you can expect serious threat possibly from multiple directions. Naturally this is the reason you have to build army in every game so you don't need to feel like matches would be any different from one another as you will always get to build and research the very same stuff each and every game!Speaking of research you might have heard of Eurekas? These very innovative ""quests"" give you so much fun if you love doing long excell sheets! You get to check culture tree, then science tree and then again culture tree every few turns to maximize free gains in science and culture techs through the quests. Not to worry, many city states have the same quests so you get to check those too. On the bright side once you learn the worthwhile stuff you will do the same techs practically every game, just change the order slight every now and then if you find some natural wonder or continent. I will say the idea behind them sounded fun, but the min-max nature it brings to micro everything is the exact opposite. It also didn't help that the quests are always the same which leads you to build and research always the same which doesn't really help when you also always have to play conquest so every single game feels exactly the same. I'll just jump to conclusion as I simply get tired, angry and frustrated just thinking about the game.Frankly this game makes me angry when I think about playing it and bored once I start playing it. It has sooooooo much micro it's not even funny and it doesn't feel like it adds anything to the game. You could micro in old games and it felt more rewarding but it still didn't feel necessary either. I always do a lot of min-maxing, but this game just feels like a chore with no reward anywhere.Positives:+Caravans create roads, cool and natural addition+Barbarians with scouts to bring in the reinforcements, another cool addition.+Unique great peopleNegatives:-AI is dumb as a brick-Poor diplomacy-Wonders are anything but wonderful-Very unpolished idea of districts and Eurekas, both do have potential.-Poor balancing, playstyles and techs don't really change. Domination, war, large empires > everything else-Tons of small and big features/things/QoL missing or not finished.-Poor replayability, the leaders/nations feel like they both dictate the game too much and still at same time won't allow you the kind of freedom in playstyle as in previous games.-Tedious as hell micromanaging.-Unclear map, once you lose vision you can't even tell the terrain properly(this looked cool in beta demo, was anything but once I actually started to play the game).Conclusion: Just buy Civ5 GOTY if you are looking to get into the series or you're old fan. It has much more features, freedom of playstyle and is way more user friendly. I don't even know who civ6 is aimed for, it feels dumbed down in many ways to deter veterans and super mega hyper micro intensive to deter new players(heck it has deterred everybody I know)."

386,60.9,Not Recommended," June 27, 2017",5,"This game needs a complete rework, if it is to even come close to the game Civ V was. The AI builds cities right next to yours even in the very beginnning of the game, forcing you to declare war on them if you want to expand beyond your capital. While this is a viable strategy in a multiplayer game vs. humans, it ruins the historical immersion that civilization usually features. The graphics aren't that top tip either and the gameplay mechanics such as: religion & culture, aren't that revolutionary compared to Civ 5.In short DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, as of now. It is completely broken, and plays like an early access game on Steam. STAY CLEAR until they fix it."
305,72.4,Not Recommended," February 26, 2017",5,"Honestly, I find this game incredibly boring. The AI doesn't seem to interact with the player in any meaningful way, and even on the Quick mode it takes forever for anything interesting to happen. Buildings, tech etc take ages to complete. War makes things more interesting, but I'm sure there are many players like myself who prefer a more peaceful approach to strategy games like Civilization. There are a lot of improved aspects to the game such as districts and changes to combat, technology, religion, and other core mechanics, as well as the colourful visual style; but it somehow just doesn't come together in an exciting way for me. You really have to be willing to put down a minimum of 6 hours per match in order to get anything out of this (in other words your entire afternoon), and you have to be okay with knowing that you may get nothing at all out of it, either out of loss or because you just get so bored that you go back to playing Civilization V or something else. Even the 'one more turn' mechanic doesn't hold much value for me anymore, because pretty much nothing happens in any individual turn, so there's no real rewarding feeling from it, especially when it starts taking so long for turns to complete processing. If you have a superhuman level of patience then this game may be for you, but as it is I just find it incredibly dull."

That's the diplomacy. It's just god awful. As soon as you go to war, every other civilization in the world will hate you. I get war DECLARED on me, I take one or two cities from the aggressor, and bam. I can't deal with anyone for the rest of the game. And at war, the enemy AI is very stupid. I've never had a challenging war. The rest of the game IS fun, but the diplomacy just detracts so much from it. It makes it a flawed product.I'm sure it's going to be fixed one day.

127,104.2,Not Recommended," October 22, 2017",11,"It's a fact of life that change is hard. I do applaud Firaxis and company for branching out and trying something new in an attempt to innovate in the long saga of Civilization titles. But, Civ 6 jarringly veers from the tried-and-true path that its predecessors engrained in the very essence of what it means to be Civilzation game.Realism aside, the prior model focused on cities and their growth. Every city could have arsenals and research and their cake and eat it, too. You did everything you could to expand their borders, claim additional tile territories and expand your empire in order to achieve this. Meaning your empire was more a coalition of super city states than anything elseThis game decentralizes the experience in a way that shifts the focus away from cities as production centers and focuses more on tile development/expansion working in synergy with your cities. Again, from a practical standpoint, it makes sense -- it's more realistic. Military bases aren't in every city. Howver, from a historical fan's take on the series, it's a wild departure from the standard M.O.Overall, the game is aesthetically pleasing and still contains many familiar game elements to prior titles. Take it with a grain of salt when you see that Gamespot rates the game as ""superb"" -- perhaps collectively their review teams have as many hours in the Civ titles as I do (4,000+). Whereas they gave it a 9/10, I think it's more like a solid 6/10."

When there is no high score, a major competitive and replayability element is gone. Furthermore, as for gameplay, the AI keeps contacting you without any real reasons and that becomes annoying as well. It looks amazing of course, but that is not the point in a CIV game.

The game as it is now just is not fun due to the state of the AI and diplomacy. I sugest to wait for a sale - 60 $ are a disgrace for the current state of the game.Nonetheless the game has a lot of nice features and intersting new ideas. If the AI was at least somewhat OK this could be a great game,.The AI is a core feature of every strategy game and here Civ 6 fails miserably.Reason:The AI is really crap - Much worse than I have ever experienced in any of the previous titles.With the current state of the AI, it just isn't fun to play due to a significant lack of challenge. Only the first hour of a game is interesting but afterwards surpassing the AI in almost every manner is inevitable. The sadest sign of the AI's inability is it's combat behaviour- it is really sad.Diplomacy also does not work like advertised by Firaxis (agendas). Moreover the warmonger penalties are insanely high (I guess Firaxis did it on purpose to hide the AI's weakness concerning combat and make leading war less attractive to the player.).There are also several UI bugs and missing UI features which were already standard in the previous iterations."

AI is nothing more than annoying, they keep repeating themselves, with popups (who likes those?) And worst of all.. They all declare war instant, if you haven't gotten the largest army in 5 turns.Even worse is the barbarians. They got like 5 horsemen attacking you from the start, if you can't catch up with a scout...All in all, totally annoying game, that makes me hate myself for being such a huge fan of this franchise... I always quit the game angry or bored, instead of having fun. Who tested this game while in development, and though, wow what a great gameplay.... If you want to try a great Civ game, get Civilization V."
386,60.9,Not Recommended," June 27, 2017",5,"This game needs a complete rework, if it is to even come close to the game Civ V was. The AI builds cities right next to yours even in the very beginnning of the game, forcing you to declare war on them if you want to expand beyond your capital. While this is a viable strategy in a multiplayer game vs. humans, it ruins the historical immersion that civilization usually features. The graphics aren't that top tip either and the gameplay mechanics such as: religion & culture, aren't that revolutionary compared to Civ 5.In short DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, as of now. It is completely broken, and plays like an early access game on Steam. STAY CLEAR until they fix it."
99,61.3,Not Recommended," February 2, 2017",5,"- Expensive DLC's- AI does not feel alive- AI will spam diplomacy requests that you cannot permanently block (like preposterous peace offers)- Diplomacy has gone haywire (razing a city belonging to a warmonger that declared on you: everyone denounces and declares on YOU!)+ Workshop finally here+ Pretty+ Plays wellGame can be a big plus, but is in need of serious work."

It is disgustingly easy to sail ahead of the AI on any difficulty and the gameplay is just so stale. I lose interest whe I have reached the modern age in 500 AD and the AI is still rocking catapults. Many of the systems are too easy to break, even without trying. I am just saddened that this game was such a let down for me. Hopefully it gets fixed in the future and actually becomes the best Civ game to date."
17,219.9,Not Recommended," January 24, 2017",5,"TL;DR - Don't buy this game, it's broken.Sadly I didn't believe the reviews about this game being a dissapointpent - well, now I must admit it.First i liked it so much, been playing a real long game on marathon speed for a week now, got a civilization with all techs in the beginning of 19th century, +150-200 everything every turn, 25-26 population cities full of food, houses and amenities with ecstatic citizens, going for the big win.Seems that the game didn't like it very much, so i got suddenly a war declaration from 2 other nations, that's ot a big problem, but then i look at my metrics and see that i got -20 amenities from war weariness, all cities stop generating gold, i get my giant army disbanded completely from bankruptcy in like 20 turns and i get barbarian tanks spawned all over my cities every 2-3 turns because of a revolt in every city.And guess what?As a patient player, i tryed for like 100 turns to get out of that mess, but it's simply impossible! With every gold producing tile worked and zero units i still got negative income from my cities, despite all policies focused on gold production. I can't even build a unit to go to the other continent and try to kill any unit from the opposite civilization to force them a peace agreement and there is no option to ask for peace in the diplomacy menu. Any units i produce just get disbanded from bankruptcy half way to the other continent. This is just completely broken!So I need to support the other downvoters here with my own - I am not recommending this game, it can't be played completely and fun because no mather how successfull you are - the game can screw you beyond revovery any moment.Such game breaking things need to be fixed ASAP - escpecially considering the high cost of this game, it is actually 2-3 times more expensive than most of my other games."

Civ II, absolutely groundbreaking. Civ III is legendary. Civ IV was just as good the previous two but not as great as III in my mind. I even enjoyed Civ V, especially after the DLCs (which will most likely be the case here, and as sad as it is I will buy those)! And then like all good things, it came to an end. At first, I was impressed with this game. However, as the game dragged on I came to understand how poor it was compared to other Civ games. There are three things that ruin it for me:1. It takes too long between turns, I have never had this problem with a Civ game before. This problem does not really arise until late in the game. With Civ V, this kind of happened, but it was minimal compared to this effort by Firaxis (VI). I have a great OS and graphics. I have time to make a plate of chicken nuggets between each turn by the time we get to missles and modern warfare.2. The diplomacy is terrible, not dynamic at all. War or nothing. Which was supposedly the focus, which I love, but the diplomacy does not even make sense.3. The AI settlement of cities, their war strategy, and handling of barbarians is absolutely senseless.In sum, play a different game until the folks at Firaxis can figure it out. This game has great potential but instead is a pile of gamer scat."
186,14.0,Not Recommended," October 21, 2017",5,"As it stands now, over a year on, it's still a buggy mess. I've not played since a week after release (hence 14 hours played) and I've kept up with update news on Reddit and it's never good.Firaxis are managing to patch bugs into the game through sloppy QA, if they're even doing any.But if you need to go to war with your wallet there's a load of over priced DLC for you to buy."
113,164.6,Recommended," October 21, 2016",5,"Updating this review after playing for several hours.I still love it but I will say that, unless I just happened to get really lucky starts, the game is significantly easier than Civilization V was on Prince difficulty.I struggled to beat Civ V on King difficulty and generally just played on Prince. I've only played full games on Prince so far in Civ VI but in the two games I've completed I completely steamrolled the AI.I was also able to enter the Industrial Era in the 1400s, which is pretty freaking ridiculous.This isn't necessarily a bad thing, and I can't comment on the higher difficulties, but once you learn to ropes and learn how to optimize the district system it seems this game isn't as hard as it's predecessor on the same difficulty levels.Also there does seem to be an issue with the AI, especially the city state AI, not upgrading their units as they progress. But again, I can't comment on how prevalent this is on the higher difficulties.All that said the game is really fun and I like pretty much all the changes they made, and I'm looking forward to bumping up the difficulty and playing even more. But it would be foolish to suggest that the game doesn't need any work to be even better, and I'm eager to see what changes the devs make over time."
382,13.1,Not Recommended," October 24, 2017",5,"Wonders are limited to tile type. I found that I chose bonuses to ancient and classical wonders but was nowhere near any tiles to build them on, basically forcing me to restart.I've never had to restart a Civ game and I've been playing since Civ III yet I found myself restarting a bunch because my starting area felt so restricting to the Civ type I wanted to play.On a large map you will spawn so close to another player that you can't place your second city without the AI giving you hassel for settling so closely, this was the case every time I restarted until I played the biggest map with the recommended AI count for the smallest map.I don't know how they did it or what exactly it is about it but this game really lacks something that the previous games had.Also the price is a joke, only got it because I got 50% off. You're paying £50-£60 for a game that has less features and depth than Civ V (with all the DLC) which you can get for ~£15."
305,72.4,Not Recommended," February 26, 2017",5,"Honestly, I find this game incredibly boring. The AI doesn't seem to interact with the player in any meaningful way, and even on the Quick mode it takes forever for anything interesting to happen. Buildings, tech etc take ages to complete. War makes things more interesting, but I'm sure there are many players like myself who prefer a more peaceful approach to strategy games like Civilization. There are a lot of improved aspects to the game such as districts and changes to combat, technology, religion, and other core mechanics, as well as the colourful visual style; but it somehow just doesn't come together in an exciting way for me. You really have to be willing to put down a minimum of 6 hours per match in order to get anything out of this (in other words your entire afternoon), and you have to be okay with knowing that you may get nothing at all out of it, either out of loss or because you just get so bored that you go back to playing Civilization V or something else. Even the 'one more turn' mechanic doesn't hold much value for me anymore, because pretty much nothing happens in any individual turn, so there's no real rewarding feeling from it, especially when it starts taking so long for turns to complete processing. If you have a superhuman level of patience then this game may be for you, but as it is I just find it incredibly dull."

So for me it seemed like a no-brainer to buy the digital deluxe when Civ VI released. Well, I wish I hadn't and here's why.1) the digital deluxe was supposed to save me money over buying the DLC seperately. $20 extra for 4 DLC. Seems fair. Except the 2 DLC that have released so far have each been less than $5, so if the next 2 aren't more substantive then I've actually paid MORE by purchasing the bundle.2) I expected ACTUAL content. So for the two DLCs have given me 1 new civilization and 1 scenario. You want me to accept that THIS is worth $10? A miniscule addition to the game and a scenario I'll probably never play? No. It isn't.3) Firaxis PROMISED a complete game at launch for Civ VI. Unlike Civ V, this was supposed to be a fully functioning game from day one. It is not. It is buggy as all hell. The diplomacy system is TERRIBLE. The religion and great person system feel like they were just tacked on as a last minute addition with little to no incorporation into the rest of the game. The amenities and housing resources are almost impossible to track or manage, especially since they are now entirely localized, unlike happiness was in previous games. Lastly, all of the information is presented in such tiny text and with completely new icons that honestly don't clearly match what they're meant to represent that it is nearly impossible to manage anything without missing some crucial element.Long story short, Civ VI has a lot of great ideas and could become something great, but right now it feels like an indie game with good graphics and too many pieces, not a flagship product from an established company."

Unfortunately when I bought it (full price), I left it running in the background in my 1st playthrough and the return period expired. So I forced myself to play it a bit further and it just doesn't grow on me.

But as the game stands right now, I just can't.Let me be clear, this is still a fun game. I do enjoy it. But it's not worth $60, because there is one major flaw that severely impacts gameplay. That's the diplomacy. It's just god awful. As soon as you go to war, every other civilization in the world will hate you. I get war DECLARED on me, I take one or two cities from the aggressor, and bam. I can't deal with anyone for the rest of the game. And at war, the enemy AI is very stupid. I've never had a challenging war. The rest of the game IS fun, but the diplomacy just detracts so much from it. It makes it a flawed product.I'm sure it's going to be fixed one day.

42,153.2,Not Recommended," February 9, 2017",5,"The game does provide fun for a while, but there are several elements that make the game less powerful than its predecessors. Actually you might start suspecting this when you realize the Hall of Fame is gone. A very sad development for the genre, and something of a shock really, to see it lost. When there is no high score, a major competitive and replayability element is gone. Furthermore, as for gameplay, the AI keeps contacting you without any real reasons and that becomes annoying as well. It looks amazing of course, but that is not the point in a CIV game. Many things are good, but CIV 1, CIV 2 and even CIV 5 was far far better. I would rate this game 6,5/10."

Instead of the overall progression that occurred with Civ 5, they took what appears to be the lazy way out and just threw a system together that works for now. The game is boring. I keep trying various civilizations and can't find anything that sparks my interest. It just isn't as well thought out as Civ 5.The only good thing I've found about the game is the ability to combine units into Corps and Armies. This makes sense in the progression of the game.

472,18.8,Not Recommended," December 21, 2017",9,"I'll give this an honest pros and cons:Pros:The graphics of the map are fantastic, they did a really tremendous job there. It looks beautiful. I really like how they did the fog of war with the illustration style renderings, it's very nice.The district system seems interesting. Not sure if it's a good or bad thing, but I like some innovation there.Cons:Bugs, inconsistent text, random issues everywhere. This game is really not polished, needs a lot more work before it can be considered ""done"". Through my first playthrough, I had nothing but frustration. I know games can be rough on release, so I purposefuly stay away for that period, but now that the first expansion is officially announced, I figured it should be fixed up enough now to be playable without major issues, that's not the case.Some bugs I encountered were:-The music just randomly stopping. There were times I would be playing, and the music would just randomly stop, while in the middle of a song. No particular reason why, or any important events, just randomly stopped. While this doesn't break the game, it does break the atmosphere.-Voice dialog repeating. Multiple times in the same first playthrough, I would achieve an advancement of some type, and the default voice acting would start playing, I would hit the button to close the window, and them it would just repeat the same voice line again. Really annoying, happened multiple times.-Inconsistent text/ablitities. I built a district that said it gave ""+2 G for each river tile connecting to it"", when planning the location, I chose a spot that was in the middle of a Y split off two rivers, I was expecting a bunch of gold for the spot, only gave +2. While this in and of itself isn't a big deal, I would expect the text explaining the units/tiles/districts to be clear, so I can tell what is going on. But this one was just one of many examples of stuff like this.Other cons include:-The new movement system is simplistic, and frustating. While in Civ V, you were rewarded for creative movement, in this one, it feels like they removed a dimension of gameplay, and it's just boringly simple now. I was playing as rome and had a road between my two cities, but yet a worker could only walk two tiles each on them, the same speed as walking on plains? I really feel like they have over simplified this area.-New leader animations are too cartoony and ugly, with unskippable dialogs that keep popping up over and over. Sure, I understand you're denouncing me, do I really have to see your ugly character animations over and over each time with no way to skip? It's just frustratingly bad.I won't list all my other minor gripes. I honestly wanted to really like this game, but it's just hard for me to. I'm just going to stick to Civ V, you might want to too."

Which is the cause of most of the bad reviews, as people tend to be overly attached to the past.Nearly every change TBO is great. From the way builders (workers) now work, to Districting.However.There are three really bad things, that just make the game nearly unplayable to me.1. Map size. The maps are WAY smaller than previous versions. A lot of the reason for this is likely due to Districts. The game has to generate a map, with that thought in mind. Which you will notice when even starting on the smallest of maps that it takes a lot of time before you actually get into the game. All of that in and of itself is not the issue until you get to 2...2. You got to 2. The AI initial cities are too close, and the AI too aggressive. I am used to actually having a decent amount of room to expand prior to making contact with an AI player. In this version of Civilization, you nearly always make contact immediately, with at least 2 AIs.Furthermore, 1-2 of them will declare war almost always around turn 75. Which pretty much means you just start to grow your first town, and have founded a second that really hasn't even started, then are at war.A war that usually means your initial city is surrounded by 5-8 units attacking it. And you have 2 cities. 1 that can make units at a decent pace which is 1 every 2-5 turns, and one that can make them even slower.Which in turn means you have now lost the game.3. Diplomacy. You seem to have decent options. All of which seem to do nothing, or very little. Furthermore, the various AIs all seem to be unstable diplomatically. Changing their minds on a whim. And making random comments and threats (...lot about city-states) that you can not interpret in any meaningful way. In one case, and only in 1, I managed to make an ally before getting attacked. And the ally did nothing at all to help me prior while I was getting destroyed. (Not that the ally had much time to react. I had 2 cities, and they were taken out in like 6 turns.)In previous version of Civ, if I needed more room, I would go to a larger map, or reduce the number of AI players. Hasn't helped one bit in this version. They ALWAYS are placed too close to you, and ALWAYS attack. No matter how it is set up.I really really really like this game. More than previous versions. All the changes except the two I remarked upon are great. Makes it worth the money, as you actually feel not only that the game has been improved, but also that you are getting a *NEW* game, instead of more of the same ole.BUT.After 2 dozen attempts to get to Turn 100 even, let alone get past 2 cities without getting wiped, I've gone back to Civ 5.As the game is unplayable as is."

To begin, you simply can not suave over any AI. Going to war or trying to trade, almost all AI's end up denouncing you for one thing or another.

You are guarenteed suprise war under 50 turns by atleast 2 AIs (Although a plus for game mechanics, the AI actually Attacks you..) Once a suprise war is declared on you, the AI is not penalized by any other AI for warmongering and is almost always friendly with every other AI. If you take just ONE city from an AI who DECLARED war on you, the game is over diplomatically. For you. This Holy War or Formal war, the penalties are most certainly not moderate but just as Egregious as ""Surprising"" your enemy.

Yet each hour I played made me more and more sad about the direction the franchise is going. It's no wonder online communities surrounding this game are dieing. To sum it up, if you want to buy it for multiplayer, don't. If you want to buy it for single player, also dont.You'd probably have a better time playing the game with no other nations. In fact, it's impossible to interact with the AI in any meaningful way. You can't trade knowledge or maps, organizing wars is really difficult, engaging in war only makes the game more of a pain due to warmongering penalties, and you still can't vassalize an enemy. Civ 4 AI wasn't the greatest but the interactions with it made the world feel alive and each game forged its own story. It was something beautiful to see, but that won't ever happen here in Civ 6.The AI is utterly incapable and if you are mildy competent, there is actually no way to lose Diety outside of getting rushed in the early game (if the AI manages to hit your cities ever). If you feel that the AI might win a victory, all you have to do is to send several units to raze their empire to the ground while their masses of obsolete units pace back and forth. Then, destroy whomever declares war on you for this or threatens victory. The only reason you might not go down this path EVERY GAME is because it gets terribly old fast and the AI will annoy you even more every turn if you are disliked.At a certain point, I asked myself ""Why am I ever playing this?"". I think I just didn't want to do my coursework. Don't bother with this awful game kids, and do your homework instead."
88,191.6,Not Recommended," January 24, 2017",5,"I am a long time fan of Civilization series, starting since the first installment.I remember playing I, II, III days and days, but this version just does not have that anymore.I also played IV and V as much as I could.I don't know whether it is the slow passing of turns, superficial novelties likeplacing buildings in neighbourhoods that do not affect gameplay, or some minor quirkslike the map visibility only being updated at the end of the unit move. Unit movement issluggish, turns take ages to finish and somehow the game just feels sleepy. There is no ""one more turn effect"" anymore, with all previous Civs I at least wanted to win the game once or twice, here I quit while I was winning and uninstalled.The unit graphics look similar to the lightweight Civs on iOS made in China, and while those were pretty good games for the platform, this one does not capture the ""epic"" proportions of the previous PC installments of the series. I suspect outsourcing to save costs, but somehow the spirit is lost.Unfortunately I can not give a recommendation to buy. If you are a owner of Civ V and expansions, you will not find much here worth your money. The game is slow even on a new PC and there is not much really new. My advice would be to buy Civ V and Expansions when it is on offer, and skip this version entirely.As much as I love the series, I think that buying this game for full price was a mistake. It is not a real sequel to the series, it is too heavy on the graphics and too light on gameplay, you don't feel like a Emperor anymore, just moving pieces on a game board. This is an interim version, I hope that the next Civ will bring the series back on the epic track."

It's visually pleasing, well voiced, intuitive in its interface and has resolved many of the previous idiotic issues the series had in the past - such as global happiness. It is by far the best state a Civ was released in the recent years and certainly a solid foundation to build on.The BadUnfortunately many of the - one would think - mandatory and essential mechanical informations about certain buildings or agents (even wonders) are only accessible through the in-game civ-pedia, rather than a mouseover and many of the early placement and development decisions will have late game consequences, which you will only learn about in the late game - in that aspect it requres a few playthroughs before you can fully optimize everything...But you really don't need to quite yet, the AI is the absolutely and utterly worst to date with regards to diplomacy and warmongering. Much like in early Total War games, your long-term friend and ally can decide - after a thousand years of peace and cooperation - to declare a war, despite there being no relation penalties.

88,191.6,Not Recommended," January 24, 2017",5,"I am a long time fan of Civilization series, starting since the first installment.I remember playing I, II, III days and days, but this version just does not have that anymore.I also played IV and V as much as I could.I don't know whether it is the slow passing of turns, superficial novelties likeplacing buildings in neighbourhoods that do not affect gameplay, or some minor quirkslike the map visibility only being updated at the end of the unit move. Unit movement issluggish, turns take ages to finish and somehow the game just feels sleepy. There is no ""one more turn effect"" anymore, with all previous Civs I at least wanted to win the game once or twice, here I quit while I was winning and uninstalled.The unit graphics look similar to the lightweight Civs on iOS made in China, and while those were pretty good games for the platform, this one does not capture the ""epic"" proportions of the previous PC installments of the series. I suspect outsourcing to save costs, but somehow the spirit is lost.Unfortunately I can not give a recommendation to buy. If you are a owner of Civ V and expansions, you will not find much here worth your money. The game is slow even on a new PC and there is not much really new. My advice would be to buy Civ V and Expansions when it is on offer, and skip this version entirely.As much as I love the series, I think that buying this game for full price was a mistake. It is not a real sequel to the series, it is too heavy on the graphics and too light on gameplay, you don't feel like a Emperor anymore, just moving pieces on a game board. This is an interim version, I hope that the next Civ will bring the series back on the epic track."

Often nothing much happens during the rather long NPCs turn, mostly a bunch of city states moving their troops aimlessly from one tile to another.Needing 3hrs to complete ~120 turns in this game (skipping 90% of the turns waiting for production to finish) is a deal breaker.The AI is broken beyond belief. Feels as if not a single AI action works as intended (troop movement, trading, diplomacy, etc.).The GUI feels sluggish and is buggy in many places. Sometimes it locks you out of the game (when using the GUI during the NPCs turn), leaving you with the only option to kill the CIV VI task and restart the game. Rarely (so far) the game crashes to desktop just because you managed to click somewhere in the wrong(?) moment.It's very hard to enjoy CIV VI in its current incarnation and absolutely not worth the AAA price tag."

It's visually pleasing, well voiced, intuitive in its interface and has resolved many of the previous idiotic issues the series had in the past - such as global happiness. It is by far the best state a Civ was released in the recent years and certainly a solid foundation to build on.Unfortunately many of the - one would think - mandatory and essential mechanical informations about certain buildings or agents (even wonders) are only accessible through the in-game civ-pedia, rather than a mouseover and many of the early placement and development decisions will have late game consequences, which you will only learn about in the late game - in that aspect it requres a few playthroughs before you can fully optimize everything...But you really don't need to quite yet, the AI is the absolutely and utterly worst to date with regards to diplomacy and warmongering. Much like in early Total War games, your long-term friend and ally can decide - after a thousand years of peace and cooperation - to declare a war, despite there being no relation penalties.

It's not tied to the numbers the game shows at the relations screen, nor is it tied to personalities.

Resulting in the need to save every turn, if not more, to avoid costly errors.

Finds a nice middle ground between the recent easier civ versus the more complex older ones.
185,608.7,Not Recommended," October 22, 2016",348,"It's a decent game. Not great...yet. Keep in mind that I have almost 1,400 hours in Civ V, so I may be a wee bit biased. I just finished my first playthrough of Civ VI. I played on Prince difficulty and specifically focused on growing my cities, optimizing districts, and investigating the Tech and Culture trees. Out of nowhere, without even trying at all, I won a cultural victory. I don't understand the Tourism mechanics yet, so I barely paid any attention to it throughout the game. Obviously neither did the AI. I played as Gorgo who has a unique Theater district which I built early so MAYBE that had to do with it. I had a few policies in the beginning that got me Great Writers, put the works in the slots, and around year 1800 I got a policy that gave me +100% Tourism. Boom. GG everybody.So let's start with the good:-The graphics are bright and pleasant and the leader screens are really beautifully animated. Just incredible character work went into these leaders.-The sound effects and music are very nice and atmospheric (though not as good as Civ V)-The culture and tech Eureka bonuses provide a whole new level of strategy and planning. Early planning will definitely have huge optimizing effects down the line if you know what you're doing.-Barbarians are a much greater threat in the early game, which is great. This allows you to farm experience and build an army to use against your neighbors if you want.-City State bonuses are fantastic and very well explained. Maintaining allied status with specific City States that suit the Victory condition you're aiming for will be very worth while.-I love the new policy system. Being able to change your government and swap out your policies is a very gratifying level of management.-I like the district system well enough, though I don't think I planned my districts optimally. They take a lot of time to build and production seems really hard to get in this game. Maybe it was my start.-Religion is more complex, but not well explained. I'll check the Civilopedia to better understand it.-All in all the game succeeds in providing that addictive ""One More Turn"" feeling that we all expect from Civ.The Bad (There's a lot):-Bad programming! I did a standard map size with 6 Civs I think. One of the AIs was my same Civ! When there's 19 to choose from! Come on!-Fewer options. Not even an Earth map! That's a Civ standard!-The new movement system is just frustrating and makes the early game drag out way too long. You really can't chase down barbarians because the damn Terrain is just too difficult to traverse.-The UI sucks. It provides both too much information and too little. For instance, you keep building these improvements for your districts, but there is no way that I can tell to check if they actually improve your yields! You can;t seem to easily check the yields on either your districts or Wonders! And they removed the City Screen completely! Instead of having one nice informative screen that tells you what your City is doing, they make you click through small icons at the bottom of the UI that are a pain to work through.-AI seems pretty weak. The only Victory they seemed to be aiming for was Religious (though they were very aggressive with that). Otherwise they completely left me alone.Never declared war. Never sent a spy. Nothing.-The Amenity system. Ugh. I don't know why Happiness got such a bad rap. It was much better and more strategic than this mechanic. With Global Happiness you had to consider very carefully whether or not to start new cities or start wars. With Civ VI it's just a pain to keep ammenities rolling in, and it requires the very expensive Entertainment distrct.-City growth...maybe I was not playing well but it seemed really difficult to grow my cities and get enough production to feel like I was truly progressing. I seemed to always be hitting a ceiling and could not figure out how to optimize my cities even with fully loaded districts and trade routes. Gold was the only thing that seemed easy to grow.-As bogged down as I felt, I was light years ahead of the AI! They don;t seem to have any good strategies for city growth or scientific advancement. I feel like the AI does not know how to take advantage of the Eureka boosts. I know I was playing on a low difficulty but some of the AIs were still stuck in the Rennaissance by the time I hit the Modern Era. I never felt remotely challenged.-Buggy. I have opened this game 4 times. I have had to force close it twice.-This is a small complaint, but the cultural borders are straight lines and hard angles that hug the hexed map. Remember in Civ V and IV they were nice organic curves that grew and changed as your culture expanded. It was way mroe immersive and dynamic.-The art style makes the map cluttered and chaotic. It is much harder to keep track of your units and way easier to click on the wrong thing which just makes gameplay less fluid and enjoyable.-Overall, even though there are a lot of new complexities added to this franchise, the game somehow feels more hollow than its predecessors.I don;t know what to say, it just doesnt feel as satisfying to play as any of the Civs before it.With all that said, I will keep playing it. I bought the $ 80 Digital Deluxe version, so I am expecting the game to vastly improve with expansions and updates. It just seems like what is there is not tuned well enough to expand on yet. The game needs serious tweaking, and frankly I will not be uninstalling Civ V anytime soon. And because of that I cannot recommend this game to seasoned Civ fans like myself."
78,378.2,Not Recommended," November 6, 2016",30,"I have been playing Civ since I was in 7th grade, when I played the original game and Colonization all the time. I have spent about 2,000 hours total playing Civ 5. I enjoyed Beyond Earth and Starships for a bit (not as good as regular Civ, but still fun). I pre-ordered Civ 6 and vocally defended it.At this point, I believe I am going to give up on the game and go back to playing Civ 5, though not very much because honestly I am mostly burnt out. I probably won't buy the next Firaxis game that comes out.My reason is that I believe that this game is broken at its core - I don't believe mods or expansions will fix what is wrong with it. I feel that this is a trend that has been going on in the gaming industry, and I am feeling saddened by it.Let me start off by saying I love the aesthetics of the game. I think the art style is brilliant; the animations are great, and I just generally love how it looks and feels. I had one game that I won through a Culture victory and generally enjoyed it.What I really don't like is the ""task-list"" based game play. Each game is basically the same: you are given a list of tasks to do, and you need to do these or else suffer. This is primarily from the Eureka/Inspiration stuff, and from the way the AI works now. The AI is based on these arbitrary things that they love you or hate you for, rather than the more organic feeling from previous games. In the past, AI generally hated you if you were expanding too fast, if you were competing with their city states, if you broke your promises, etc. Now they hate you really fast for silly things. I think it was a great idea as a concept, but I don't believe it was executed well. In Civ 5 it was better with the Ideologies (it was great how game-long friends suddenly become enemies because they are Autocrats while I am using Order, etc).I am not enjoying warfare in this game. It's just about spamming units, and I don't like the way the promotion system works.At first I liked Districts, but now I despise them. They look beautiful and really enhance the visuals, but I just don't like the way they work. This game is now all about micro decisions to maximize benefit, rather than the organic fun that previous games were.There are small things that I think expansions could fix, such as the lack of information. I am having a hard time figuring out Religious Pressure, culture border growth, Barbarian expansion, etc. I can't find a unit list to figure out where all my units are and to find idle ones.So far I have 1 completed game and about 10 abandoned games, because they just weren't fun for me. I am still glad that I pre-ordered and if I had to go back in time I would do so again. I get a bit teary-eyed thinking about this, since for the last almost 25 years Civ has been my absolute favorite game franchise and a big part of my entertainment life, and I am feeling that perhaps the magic is gone. It may be gone for good."

Better buy Civ 5 full edition and play that while waiting for this one to be playable.This game eithers works ""OK"" IF you are very lucky or its is bugged like hell. Me and my wife loved to play Civ 5 so around December we went and got Civ6 Deluxe Edition so we can play it together. For us it was hell since the start...FIRST the damn deluxe bonus we should have got just did NOT work, the game simply did not show Aztec civ and also the few civ that they released since then had the same problem: Vikings, Poland, Australia, Persia and Macedonia simply did not work even if we can see them in game as installed, they just don't show up as playable. And we did a fresh Install (after every patch, or new civ) and all the things we found on diferent forums about that missing civ bugs. One day Aztec, Vikings and Poland simply poped up as playable civs....sill waiting for the others civs to work....Other then that the entire game seems more like a beta version at best: Resources seem to get bugged out and you either get them or not at random on every turn.

They are like mud on your boots, weighing you down as you try and progress.* The other Civs cheat like ****. No attempt to make them clever or interesting. They are just whinning, cheating, overly aggressive bullies.

204,25.3,Recommended," October 23, 2016",20,"Before I delve into this review, let me just say that I have logged 488hours on civilization V and have been playing civ for the last 15 years.-- Overall Score / TL;DR -- [8/10]Overall I give this a score of 8/10 as it feels as innovating as a new iteration of a long-time award-winning serie should be. Looking at the history of Civilization, and especially comparing this to Civ V, I feel that this is gonna be a great platform for future generations, to introduce them to the world of Civilization.The 60 euro price tag, can seem a bit daunting for some, but I'd recommend buying this game if you are a veteran of Civilization, and if you are new player, wait for a sale, at which time, most of the bugs that are currently in the game will have been fixed.This is what Civilization: Beyond Earth should have been, A complete game, that doesn't feel like just another dlc with a high price tag.Best Regards,Yilmas - Staff of the communityRight of the bat, we are met by some really astounding cinematic, a bit doe eyed characters though, and background music, This of course doesn't change the game, but makes us believe that they actually put some effort in to the game. But lets head on into the review worthy parts of the game, that we all want to know about.From the very beginning when the first gameplay videos surfaced on youtube, we were all met by a dramatic change in the style choice, which at first glance looked a bit plastic-like. Many was upset about this aspect, but I personally decided to reserve my judgement for when the game had been released.After a full standard map game on Prince, (research victory), I've come to a bit of a bland feeling about the new look. It definitely looks great on my 4k running at max settings. But does it change the gameplay in any good or bad way ? No. As the game progressed I found myself using the strategic view more and more, as the screen was cluttered with unit and information. However, this was something I was expecting as it was the same for me in Civ V. In the beginning of the game, I did feel though that the style was pretty to look at, but after some time it was the gameplay that caught me and the graphic was ignored. Which is just the way I believe Civilization should be. This game should not be selling itself on its graphics.The user interface is very clear cut, I didn't feel they were wasting the space they had, and for once the UI scaling worked great on 4k.We have all the information we need, and the rest is found through ease-of-access menu buttons, located where you would expect them.One a side note, I was very much annoyed that you couldn't right-click out of a town interface, but had to click on a unit and then right-click to hide the info-cards.The changes with the mechanics behind builders I felt to begin with was quite drastic. And as the game progressed, I've come to feel that 3 uses of a builders is a bit too little. I think 5 would be ideal (7 with policy card). But overall, it didn't change too much gameplay wise. Though the point of killing the ever-living builder principle worked out.All right, so this is probably the biggest difference between Civ V and Civ VI. The districts. Even after a full game, I still don't know whether or not I like them as much as having multiple buildings. Because let's face it, they are basically just buildings. And with the builders mechanic change, the districts is just a way to fill out those improvement slots that are left available now.Can you dedicate a city for one or two purposes, yes. Could you do it in Civ V, yes. Does it feel different after a full game, no. Sure the cities looks much nicer than Civ V, with these new districts. But I just don't feel like it makes such a big change in the game as it was promoted to do.I decided to bump this sections rating, by ""1"" because of the aesthetic aspect that the districts definitely brings.The civic or policy aspect of the game has been changed quite drastically compared to civ V. But I really love this new iteration of it. I feel you have so much more power over the customization of your nation's policies. And the use of the governments are perfect. Especially the ""legacy"" attributes are a nice idea.I love the new relation window, as it gives you much more useful information about the other leaders. And the feature of each leader having a secret and known ""policy"" was integrated perfectly in my mind. Though it does take some time to get used to it.I expect Firaxis will be releasing a patch (once all the crash-fixes are done) to boost the AI's strategies. Now of course, I only played it on Prince difficulty, but the AI compared to Civ V was a bit dumb at times. Moving too much around instead of attacking, and misplacing the encampment districts."
58,60.0,Recommended," November 5, 2016",120,"I really wish steam offered a star rating system instead of a black and white option for this game. Die-hard fans of the franchise will likely be disappointed, yet also understanding, and new players will likely find the game underwhelming. Below is my reasoning why, starting with the positives.1. Graphics. A lot of people think the graphics are too cartoony. While I agree with this assessment, if you have your settings turned up high enough, absolutely everything is animated. It certainly looks cool and makes the game seem very attuned to detail (if only this carried through into bugs).2. Trade. I really appreciate how they've redone trade, road construction is far less tedious and contains much less micromanagement. However you don't have control over how the roads are formed, so sometimes city connections are skipped over, requiring manual control. It's still an improvement. I really wish they would make total trade routes city-based rather than a set quoata per empire, but thats just me.3. Espionage. This one is a really easy one to call an improvement. The depth of epsionage out of the box is far more nuanced and available compared to previous games. You have excellent, practical options for cities, as well as depth through escape routes. There are no counter-espionage buildings like in civ VI BNW, but this could be added later.4. Resources. Nobody seems to be commenting on this, but the game returns to Civ-IV style resources where instead of quotas the game uses blanket production resources (meaning you only need one to build all units that use it). This is an improvement I certainly welcome the return of.5. Even More Depth!!! The gameplay is certainly more nuanced than previous versions, with the so-called ""Un-stacking"" of cities. I'm sure everyone understands how districts work, but I have a few complaints about them as well. This certainly removes the realism of previous games, but also in some aspects installs new versions of it.7. No More Missiles! This Is something I see overlooked in most reviews, so I'm happy to discuss it here. Nuclear Devices and Thermonuclear Weapons supplant traditional nukes, which were Atomic Bombs and Tactical Nukes in previous versions of civ. Once they are constructed, they can be easily deployed from any nuclear-capable unit, whether that be a ""Missile Cruiser"" (The in-game model is actually a Soviet Corvette), Nuclear Submarine, or Bomber. Nuclear submarines are also now capable of land attack, and fire cruise missiles without them having to be constructed.Now on to the negatives:1. Diplomacy. This is what everyone is talking about, and I completely agree with everyone else; you can more or less ignore this aspect of the game entirely. Nobody seems to care about anyone else, and everyones' conflicting agendas are interesting, but they only serve to perpetuate distrust in practice. For example, Qin Shi Huang of China hates it when you build a wonder. ANY wonder. So please don't plan on making friends with China if you're even remotely ambitious as a Civilization. Some nations seem to appreciate nations that are smaller than they are innately, which seems cool, but this really doesn't serve well for winning the game. Diplomacy victory is also gone... so don't waste your time.2. AI. They really missed the mark on this one. AI don't upgrade units, and instead simply move them around, allowing them to be mowed down by superior technology.3. Game Pace. This one might just be me, but it seems like everything just takes longer to do in this game than in previous versions. Movement is a complete mess, with roads only working half of the time, and units taking forever to move across oceans, tiles, and other things. It can take ages to deploy an army in the face of a surprise or joint war, and it takes decades for nuclear submarines to cross oceans. Buildings, especially late game, take a ridiculous amount of time to improve and recreate, especially if buildings were pillaged. Units are very costly.4. Wonders. I'm not sure why, but they completely nerfed the importance of wonders on a global stage. Tile specificities leave ancient era wonders unconstructed into the Industrial Era. They require a considerable investment of resources and time, and do not provide huge benefits (to score, and improvement-wise) unless you meet very specific conditions, some of which only come out of pure luck. Score calculations have also been completely reworked, and wonders no longer count as largely as they used to for score.Im giving this one a hesitant recommend. I love the series, but I have trouble convincing myself to get back to the game and play some more given how tedious play is now. I'll probably give it another go, but I'm waiting for the workshop to be opened."

The new release brings slightly different gameplay, but unfortunatelly the AI has not evolved.I would love to see smarter AI, not cheating AI.So, what is so bad about AI?Broken AI and diplomacy; some examples include:-AI settlers travel unprotected-AI settlers hesitate to build cities, just roam-AI DOW when much inferior-AI unrealistic peace negotiation offers when loosing-trading resources deals do not make any sense (sometimes you get great offer and 30 turns later bad offer for the same resource)-player penalty for broken promises (keep units away from border, building cities close to AI), when in fact the promise was kept-no penalty for AI broken promises-AI does not upgrade units-AI comments on my empire sound like riddles that I really do not understand or actually care about.It almost feels like AI makes lots of random decisions.One moment they are impressed with my navy (I have only two ships) and then 20 turns later I am denounced for having a weak navy."
400,153.5,Not Recommended," October 20, 2016",37,"Eh... not really a great game but its certainly not bad.AI still suffers from mild case of retardation by declaring wars thats its unable to win even against city-states.You can still block AI settlers making them unable to progress with building more cities.Theres also some problems with UI making it hard to tell apart different icons at bottom right quickly when you select unit, atleast for now but ill probably learn them eventually.Other problem with UI is that it doesnt tell when your cities/encampments can attack and the icon for their attack command is really small and hard to click forcing me to click it multiple times before it recognizes that i clicked on it.Also sometimes your garrisoned troops ""flag"" make it impossible to click it because the icon is behind the flag.Small edit after playing for few days now: AI keeps denouncing me for stupid reasons like theyre settling next to my border then complaining that i need to move the troops that have stood in the same place for 1000+ years.AI also declaring more random wars, most recently america declaring on me at around year 1200ad for no reason at all without even denouncing me and being best friends since like 1000bc despite me having superior tech and equal number of forces.City-states seem to have problems upgrading units where i just saw one cultural city-state have 3 of the very basic warrior that you get at start of game still in 1950ad and nothing else and no they havent been in situation where they would of lost those troops.Game has also frozen on the screen after i quit 2 times now forcing me to restart my computerEdit 2: After 52 hours of playing i can say that this is without a doubt the worst civ game ive ever played, the anemeneneneties system makes no sense to me still after 52 hours and it seems to be wayyy too influential on other parts of the game and i think its even worse than civ 5's happiness system. At this point i cannot even guess how the ♥♥♥♥ they could ever fix this game no matter how much patching or dlc's theyre gonna bringOverall id recommend waiting for sale or if you cant wait that long then atleast wait for patches"
480,2.1,Not Recommended, February 10,16,I refunded CIV6 when it first got releasedTwo years later I though that maybe some of the game issues got fixed and bought it on a sale for 12 bucks.Unfortunately you can't refund the same game twice. Don't repeat my mistake.
418,34.9,Not Recommended," October 30, 2016",136,"My first experience with the AI was amazing. A barbarian hid in one tile of another nation's territory when it was declared that we no longer had open borders. As I was chasing it with a melee unit it was now impossible to reach. No matter what I did it stayed there out of reach.I finally managed to get open borders and kill it but that encounter really raised my expectations.Unfortunately the rest of the game was trash. Similar to Civ V units shuffle around randomly with the added feature of sitting in your territory on the same tile forever, waiting to die. I'm guessing that this is actually what the barb was doing but I had just interpreted some higher level of intelligence that wasn't there due to lack of experience with the game.The AI nations all hate you and denounce you as a warmonger even if you've never declared war on anyone for the entire game!The whole diplomacy side of the game can be completely ignored. Religion can be completely ignored. Wonders can be completely ignored. I never built a single trade route.However, I won that game easily by attacking the nation's that declared war on me because the AI is so terrible.By the 1300's I had nukes and infantry and machine guns for city defence that would 1-shot absolutely any unit type that approached. Strangely, the default city defence machine guns could attack 2 tiles away but the machine guns I upgraded to from archers (archers that also had a range of 2) only had a range of 1 which made them worthless.With the new movement restrictions and roads that don't seem to do anything most of the time you'll find that units take over 100 years to travel from one side of your nation to the other (20-30 turns 2 tiles at a time even on roads). Because unlike other games you need the full 2 movement points to move to a hill or forest and any leftover movement points are always wasted. Want to move to grassland then finish on a hill? If you've only got 2 moves per turn this will take 2 turns.For this reason ranged units are clearly OP. All the units are stuck in the mud and you can take pot shots at them to your heart's desire. This is also why helicopters are so powerful in the late game as they ignore these ridiculous movement rules (though for some reason they turn into boats when flying over water - perhaps because that game actually lists them as light calvary). Once you have helicopters you can just delete your other units as they are the first flying unit in a strategy game that can capture a city.In most RTS/TBS games you can wear down the city defence with any type but always need infantry to perform the capture. Not here, just fly in a sole heli or heli army (3 helis stacked) a few turns and the sole unit can wear down and cap the city by itself. It may take 1-2 damage from melee ground units (I'm not sure how they can reach the heli in the air but again maybe because the game thinks it's a light cav unit).The game only ever crashes upon exit but it also freezes for 5-10 secs at the start of every turn for no reason. All of the AI nations and barbs have made their moves and the indicator is letting you know that it's now your turn but you can't do anything because it's frozen. I tried turning off the autosave or setting it to every 5 turns instead if every single turn but it made no difference.There's lots of other things wrong with the game like the terrible luxury system that assigns luxuries randomly to cities. Additional luxuries after the first do nothing as before but this doesn't work as happiness is now local instead of global. So if you have 2 instances of a luxury then which cities benefit? What happens if one is pillaged or lost? Who knows? The game tells you nothing in this regard you you can either guess or completely ignore yet another core Civ feature.With the long list of core features that make a Civ game all being non-existent, unexplained or indecipherable in this version you just end up taking a few cities every few turns and that's about all there is to the game.Civ 2 is a better game than this."
792,293.1,Not Recommended," October 26, 2016",136,"TL;DR: It's so much worse than Civ VDon't get me wrong, there are good things to this game, but it needs major patches, or an expansion, to be an experience comparable with Civ V.Eureka moments for tech and civics are great. Districts are a great idea. Bringing back governments, and making it impossible to have cities that are all things to all people are great. However, there's big problems.My least favorite part is the changes to religion. The idea of religious combat sounds fine and all, but in practice, it's horrific: You are in a religious war EVERY TURN OF THE GAME, healing units requires going back to a city, and you have a whole 3 kinds of units to wage this war with. This makes religion a huge attention drain that you can't ignore, because an enemy AI will be going for a religious victory. Let someone else take over your religion? Great, now they must be your primary target for military war, because otherwise, a military path might just hand the other player the game!There's also no way to really get anywhere without a large empire: Culture? You won't be able to house enough great works to matter, as the maximum number of great works per city is tiny. To increase that, you also need religion, going back to the paragraph above.Another mechanic that makes us need huge empires is military: An extremely large majority of units require strategic resources to be built. Nobody is ever going to trade you for them, so you must expand wildly. Lacking an iron mine in your starting area? Congratulations, you have to rush forward in tech, and hope the strategic resource is anywhere near you.But let's not forget, that science makes things more expensive: Yes folks, moving forward in the science track makes creating districts harder, so you can end up being unable to do very much because you moved forward in science too fast. Nothing like creating a new city, and seeing that it takes 70 turns to build anything.So my veredict is that it's way too easy to get yourself in very unfun situations for the game to be worth it today. I'm sure it'll be fixed eventually, but right now, I can't recommend the game."
32,416.5,Not Recommended," March 17, 2017",14,"Huge Civ fan since the beginning.I hate the characterture look of the AI leaders, and the buildings in general. Its too comical in appearance and the bright colours make it look like disneyland.Wonders shouldn't take up an entire hex. the scale of everything is strange.Both the civic tree and tech tree are poorly mapped out and far too military focussed.I don't like the districts idea. I would rather just see the city expand into adjacent hexes, and each hex can only hold so many buildings, and thus making it harder to capture if the entire city needs capturing.AI is very poor. This is the worst aspect of the game. Militarily the AI is dumb, and it declares war on you with no plan at all.There are spelling errors throughout. Last one I saw was on the victory screen for a team multiplayer conquest victory. Really? Is it that hard to get the spelling correct?I had high hopes for this game but alas it failed."
51,50.1,Not Recommended," July 3, 2017",12,"Disappointing.Some new pros since V:District system. You build specialized districts in each city that occupy map squares. Each can be upgraded with specialized buildings and even can be used to defend the city.Great works. Advanced system, with multiple ways to find great works/artifacts, increasing the culture & tourism of a city.Civics government. An entire new 'tech'-like tree to develop. These civics allow you to specialize/customize your government giving your civ bonuses.Cons:Crashes. 2 of 3 games, so far, ended prematurely due to game breaking crashes. In both cases when an AI conquered the city of another AI. Unable to resolve, so many hours work of a game are wasted, or backup 20+ turns and become a crazy warmonger to try to save the civ under assault. Fair warning, you'll be condemned by the entire world, including the civ under assault. Not expected for a $60 AAA game.Science vs production. Science is incredibly fast, production is incredibly slow. You end up with poorly developed cities.At best, you try to build a specialized city. Well-rounded cities are impossible. You also don't get a chance to enjoy mid/early game eras. They just fly by too fast.Builders. They are limited now, so you only get a couple upgrades before you have to build another one (10-20 turns, see production). Also, they can't build roads anymore. Roads are only built by traders which construct then between 2 cities. So you have to either get traders in the right spots or wait until mid/end game for a new military engineer (which also has a limited number of uses). Part of the fun for me in Civ was maximizing your cities/area. This is impossible with this version now.Movement. Without roads, slower than it's ever been. Even with roads, they don't have the same bonuses, so your troops just move incredibly slowly. By the time you build a unit and move it to the front, that unit is obsolete since there have been 20 tech increases since starting production. This is true until modern era.Diplomacy. In general, it's silly. The other leaders simply act irrationally, denouncing for any number of ridiculous reasons and making it difficult to build any kind of useful allies. 90% of civs will dislike you 90% of the time, even if you never declare war."
334,145.8,Recommended," December 22, 2016",12,"Civilization 6 is perhaps not as huge a makeover as the transition from 4 to 5 was, but in my opinion it still brings with it a major overhaul of the core game mechanics over civ 5. Of course, there are the headline new features such as the policy tree and city districts, but I think the biggest changes to how the game plays are elsewhere. The supply of money in the game is much more generous than in civ 5. this allows for more flexibility in gameplay by giving you the option of reacting to surprises or simply jumpstarting progress towards your goals. Additionally, build times for most units have been decreased relative to the previous game, which means you can build more units and field larger armies. Limited unit stacking has been added back in this game, but it has been done so in a way that preserves tactical gameplay. Spies appear to have gotten a boost in usefulness over the previous game too, and they can be devastating against an opponent who is trying to win a science or culture victory.Sadly, there are currently some balance issues with the game, and these balance issues that negate a lot of the advantages of the reworked mechanics. I think the first issue is the AI in the game appears to be based on the Beyond Earth AI, which means they are largely too peaceful and universally hate conquerors. I have yet to play a game with a warlike AI who pursues a domination victory. It seems the AI will pursue science, religious, or culture victories only. This is unfortunate and it leads to a certain predictability and lack of variety across games. Finally, it seems the effort required to achieve various victories is not quite balanced. Until the most recent (Dec 20, 2016) patch, science victories required both a tremendous science investment and a very large industrial investment, which meant someone might win another victory long after you have completed the research tree, but have yet to build and launch all the rocket parts. I believe the latest patch is meant to address this issue. However, the religious victory is still the most out of balance of all of them. This is largely due to how the religion mechanic works in civ 6.In civ 6, religion is a core feature of the game, not an added feature. If you want to pursue a religious victory, you must decide to do so at the very beginning of the game, since in each game there are fewer religions allowed than there are civilizations. This is I think the core failing of the religion mechanic. You must push to get the most religious points and buildings early, so you can found a religion. If you do found a religion, you can spam religious units who can ignore borders and convert cities in any empire. Any civilization who does not have their own religion must resort to physically blocking their cities from being converted by constantly keeping their cities surrounded by units or going to war to capture/destroy the invading religious zealots. If you do have your own religion, you can build units to defend with. However, religious warfare is not all that interesting, since there are only a handful of different units and only one that is capable of offensive religious warfare against other (religious) units. This basically comes down to who can spam the most units wins. It seems that in many games, there are usually two major religious players and if you're going for a religious victory, your major challenge is defeating the other major religion. all the other players have no defense, which is different when compared with other victory types where every civ can be at least somewhat competitive or at least have a credible strategy for countering a win.A science victory can be held off with spies, as can a culture victory or a domination victory. (sabotage factories and spaceports, steal artefacts). A domination victory can be held off by simply holding your capital. However, I have yet to see an AI anywhere close to a domination victory. A culture victory, as with a science or domination victory, can be achieved by simply out-producing your opponent at the relative metric. You can use conquest or production to fuel this rise in power. However, a religious victory cannot be rolled back largely because there is no mechanism to de-radicalize your own cities or the cities of others if you have already been converted. If you have yet to be converted but were not lucky enough to get your own religion, it is only a matter of time before someone converts you. Once that happens, you can convert cities to that religion, but that doesn't help you. that helps your opponent. I suppose in theory you could try to interpose your religious units to prevent an opposing religion from becoming too dominant, but if whoever converted you is already dominant, there’s basically nothing you can do short of militarily eliminating the civ that spawned the religion. However, this option will incur a heavy diplomatic penalty from every other leader in the game.I think that leads into my final complaint with the AI in this game, which is an unfortunate side-effect of a rather interesting feature of the personalities they imbued each civilization with. Essentially, each civilization respects strength in specific areas, and your strength or weakness in those areas will provide diplomatic bonuses or penalties with that leader. For instance, Cleopatra respects military might, while Harold respects a strong navy. The trouble with this, is that many leaders respect strength in areas that they themselves are strong in, leading them to like leaders that are in direct competition with them. Other leaders don’t have this problem, but there are quite a few who do. Separately from that issue, no leader appears to recognize when a leader is nearing victory in a specific area. Thus, a leader might continue to respect your strong culture and like you for it right until they lose. There does not seem to be a sense that they are in competition with you or each-other. Thus, if you act to prevent a civilization from winning through war, you will incur a heavy diplomatic penalty even though other civilizations should instead be backing your play.At the time of writing, I hesitate to recommend the game to someone who has civilization 5 with all the expansions and DLC. That game has more balance and diversity of gameplay than this game does in its current state. However, if you haven't played civilization before or simply haven't played in a long time, this is a fun and refreshing game that has tons of replay value and still preserves that ""one-more-turn"" addictive fun. I am going to mark recommended, because I have played 100 hours of this game and have enjoyed my time with it. I will probably put another 50-100 hours in before the first expansion comes out, and then I will likely play it for several hundred more hours."
73,228.3,Not Recommended, February 12,10,"I've been playing since the first Civilization game and this series is easy in my top 3 best games ever.I have played over 800 hours in Civilization V, but I cannot stand Civ VI.It's great on paper. You have agendas that should make leaders differ from each other, eurekas mechanic, another ""layer"" of religion ( they can fight ) and of course buildings are now grouped and can be placed only in unique districts.This all sounds fantastic... but in reality it really isn't...This Civilization has the WORST AI I have ever seen in series. AI doesn't know how to attack a city if you build a wall, or use ranged units, or use air units or naval units. It's not a joke, I've been playing Civ 6 for over 200 hours - you can have couple of units for etire game. AI doesn't know how to upgrade them either.Implementation of agendas is just stupid. How the hell this is normal that some leaders just hate you becouse they require a naval units, or spy or other silly things even when it's impossible to get them in lets say 2500 BC.. They willdenounce you without a reason, start a war without enough units and after couple of turns they will give you half of their cities becouse you killed 2 of their units...Eurekas and science progress are so unballanced that I have no idea how this game could be in such state after 1 year after release. You can just fly through eras without any problem. What's more ridiculous is that, if you play on king or higher difficulty, AI has so much production and science bonuses that can make to modern era in 1200 AD....I thought that with new patch that come along with Rise and Fall something will change.

Sadly, that is the main thing and only reason why I still play the game. I don't understand the reason to change and get rid of many factions and leaders. Like, the DLC is another problem. Major. Civ 4 dlc was kind of stupid cause it was stand alone games with similar interfaces. Civ 5 DLC was perfect. PERFECT. Actually added to the game, uncommon of most DLC for games now a days. What the hell is the DLC for Civ 6? Really, just lump the scenario packs so far together for $15 and that would make more sense then $4-$10 for only 1-2 civilizations. Like, what happened Firaxis, what happened?Also, recently jumped ship on this game for the Beyond Earth, and boy have you guys worked on that one, especially with the Rising Tide dlc. I love Civ4,5, and Beyoned Earth but with the Rising Tide dlc, Beyond Earth Soared to the top for me.

26,298.4,Not Recommended," November 20, 2016",10,"The game feels like it was rushed out. For example, units have always had nuemerical value with their attack and production costs, yet the descriptions we get are ""This is a unique land unit"". The civilopedia is a shell of its formerself; if you want to see what unlocks armadas or grants builders the ability to plant forests your best bet is to use Google. The interface needs to be reworked; if you want to cancel a move function you have to press escape twice (once to open the menu, once to close it). Why can't we just simply press 'M' again to toggle off move? Not to mention the countless bugs.The game has an infinite gold exploit that most users will discover by accident. The ai is easily manipulated and baited accross all difficulties. There is no Earth map.The only saving grace is that the new district feature adds a lot of fun to the game.

294,231.9,Recommended, March 16,85,"Rise of the Civilization?I am going to start with very unpopular, but true statement: Civilization VI with Rise and Fall DLC is the best entry of the whole series. It's engaging, beautifully designed and finally has some complex mechanics, which are truly shining in mid and late game. Being sentimental or not, Civilization VI is an important step in the right direction. And I’m pretty sure there is more to come.This will be a quite long and detailed review. Still, I won't point everything, but only the most important things about this game.AIFirst of all, we are talking about Sid Meier's Civilization and let's make it clear: AI was never the strongest point of those games. Yes, in this one it had some serious problems at the release, but right now it's fine. Just fine. For example, playing on “King” difficulty, which is my favorite, is quite satisfying. AI is not declaring stupid wars and if so, it is not sending units to death. It's also properly upgrading older units. If not prepared, we can actually lose some cities. Why “King” difficulty? This is a 4X strategy game and on higher difficulties AI is simply cheating. It's not fun for me.If you are complaining about AI in Civilization VI, then let me remind you, that in “glorious” IV different civilizations were losing to barbarians in turn 2. How stupid was that? And Civilization V? It had many flaws as well. Not mentioning the fact, that the “vanilla” version was very… empty.I wasn't very happy after seeing early gameplays. I didn't liked this soft and anime style of the game, but I have appreciated it with time. Whole map, units, districts, cities and finally wonders, are all very detailed and they do look great. What's more, we can turn on day and night cycle and it's actually really cool to see you empire during night. Optimization is also great, at least for me. There is no ""end game lagg"" here.Whole map has also been changed a bit with Rise and Fall DLC. For example, if we are in the dark age, everything is a little bit darker and in comparison, during golden or heroic ages, everything is full of joy and light. It's a little thing, but as we all know, being accurate about those little things is also the difference between being good or great in what you do. Civilization VI in terms of audio-visual performance has plenty of those “things”. Sometimes you just sit, watch and listen (at this point I highly recommend you to search for Zulus Atomic Theme, you will thank me later).Leaders. They are fine and personally, they were never important for me. While looking at whole Civilization series, we see nations, not leaders. And yes, there are plenty of women as leaders in Civilization VI, but remember one thing: historically, they were great. Complaining about “excessive feminism” won't change anything and is simply stupid, but on the other side we are living in XXI century and people are complaining about everything now. Returning to the game itself, there are many civilizations to choose from and what's the most important, you can feel that they are unique in terms of actual gameplay.Going through all the eras feels smooth. Like in previous Civilization games the music is also changing and we can feel that everything is more modern as the time pass. Of course it's not perfect at the moment. Mostly because there are certain techs that can be rushed or strongly focused at, so for example we can get late Renaissance units, while all our opponents are still stick with Middle Ages knights or even worse. To be honest, it was always a problem and it's really hard to find a perfect solution here. In the end the game is quite fair and sometimes we can be surprised that our enemies have such strong units or technology already. You need to make a use of your starting position, all resources, terrain and special abilities of your civilization. All those things make every experience unique and we can all agree that it's the best thing in Civilization games.Scenarios. If you like them, you will be disappointed, because you can get most of them only by buying small DLC packs. They are quite original, just like in Civilization V, but there are not too many of them and you can finish most of them in around an hour. This aspect is the one, that in my opinion should receive a lot of attentions from devs right now. I love playing historically accurate scenarios, but well… I'm still waiting for them here. Of course there is Steam Workshop integration so you can download a lot of cool stuff, scenarios and new civilizations, but as we all know, it's not the same.Obviously I am not going to list everything here. Yet, there are some things that in comparison to other Civilization entries changed for good and there are also many new things, mostly introduced in Rise and Fall DLC, which are really nice. First of all, tech and civics trees are both designed in pretty different way, making you actually think about them during the game. What's more, you can boost most of them and you need to know how to do this, since they all have special triggers. Secondly, governments are back. Through the game you are unlocking plenty of policy cards, but you can use only some of them. Thanks to those, you can finally customize many things about your policy.While building your city, you also need to remember that wonders and districts are being built on hex tiles, not within the city itself. This is important, because while you colonize you can't look only after the resources, but you need to think about districts and potential places on which you can build important wonders. A pleasant strategic element. I have seen that people are complaining about districts, but in my opinion they are really interesting. Thanks to them game itself has more depth and some districts, like military one, can be crucial in defending our empire, so you always need to think twice before choosing where to build them. Same with wonders. In Civilization VI you can't have all of them, like you could in previous one. You need to choose carefully which wonder will suit you best in your current playthrough.Most interesting changes came with Rise and Fall DLC. Firstly, loyalty system which is nice for players who like to play passively. If your citizens are happy, you can apply pressure on nearby cities and actually annex them into your empire. You also need to think where to start your new cities, because otherwise it's easy to lose them during dark age in our empire. What's more? We have great ages, mentioned above, and governors. While playing the game we earn special points by doing some things, like discovering wonders, conquering barbarians, hiring great people etc. If we reach certain amount of them, our civilization will be in a golden age, which gives us some perks. If we won't do anything about this, we can end up in dark age, which may be actually quite dangerous for us. Governors are special persons placed in the cities. Their specialization bonuses are quite strong and setting them in the right city can be crucial for the game. On the other side you need to look which governors are used by your opponents. All those new things are very interesting and thanks to them mid and late game are both more interesting than they used to be.If you are looking for the grand strategy, Civilization VI is not for you. .

76,4.8,Not Recommended," October 21, 2016",36,"Many new features that need exploring, and different concepts are a big advantage, but historically, I can't help but be extremely disapointed with the Civ VI.As a Portuguese, I was already upset that my great nation wouldn't be present in the initial game, even though I'm expecting it to be available in the next download.Even further, I don't understand what the Kongo, Scythia, Brazil and the Aztecs did, in historical reasoning, to deserve to be in the initial game and a nation like Portugal, who actually was the first and longest world empire, had the biggest navy, best sailors and most well known doctors, didn't get a spot in the top20...What shocked me the most was Spain. The Spanish leader, one of the least memorable in historical terms (he was the one who actually lost the invicible armada vs... a storm), it is a HUGE DOWNGRADE from Isabela in Civ V.Not only that, but the leader presents himself as ""the king of Spain, Portugal and..."". Seriously? For a nation with 900 years of historical background, the 60 year period when we had Spanish rulers was the chosen one?I agree that changing the leaders is good for the game, but why change ones and not the others? Ghandi is still around, and with good reason, why pick a 3rd tier leader from a country to represent that nation?Played this game for 2h and, due to this and a few other features, already have the will to uninstall it... Certainly not worth the 60 euros, specially if taken into account that the developers are targeting the product to underaged people (as one can see from the incredibly anoying baby graphics) and teach them the most useless caracters in world history.Thanks Sid Meier's, you actually gave me the worse surprise in my gaming history, it actually topped Beyond Earth for 1st place."

The barbarians are also more of a risk early game and I love that as well.Con, AI is terrible I don't understand how we can go to CIV 5 to CIV6 and take a step back.Also they starting positions of Civs near you even on a huge size map it really ridiculous however you can edit in the game file. *They start insanely close* Most likely to speed up the game.Sid Meier's Civilization VI A Screenshot of Sid Meier's Civilization VIBy: SwordThaneI had 4 Civs go to war with me over litterly nothing some of us were even Allys.Meh- I really don't like the new research tree where you can boost it by doing various things, again they most likely did this to speed up the game but I can get over it. They also don't have very many options when it comes to selecting #number of city states and ect.If they fixed the AI then I could probably recommend it but seeing as I play single player 99% of the time this is a big issue for me.

For me, the large map made gameplay and exploration much more interesting and varied.The second thing I don't like--the barbarians. OK, it's cool that they scout out your territory and come back in force if you don't deal with them in a reasonable time. But nothing will match the barbarian civilizations that occurred in Civ IV--I guess a feature never to be repeated, they just squat in their tiny camps and grow military units (except for the occasional 'builder' you can capture.The city building, with districts preceding construction of buildings (like you must have an entertainment district before you can construct an arena or an industrial district before you can construct a workshop, etc) is a good feature and makes the city growth more interesting.Still, the maps and the barbarian implementation kinda kill Civ VI for me (a little less than 200 hours playing), making me think I'll just return to Civ IV and Civ V for my periodic civ fixes."

Still needs a major revamp though.- Warmongering penalties are massive, so if you enjoy rolling over cities like its your God given right, don't expect too many friends.- Expansion is promoted and because the happiness of your civilizations have gone under change, the only thing stopping you from settling cities is whether or not you think someone will get angry from you taking their land.- The Aztec's are♥♥♥♥♥♥♥- Unit upgrades are expanded and a bit more balanced, renaming units and cities is easier and more avaliable compared to Civ V.- Millitary rehaul was a good rehaul.

110,102.8,Not Recommended," October 25, 2016",8,"This game was released way too early, once again. It has a lot of nice new features, and not a lot is missing from previous ones, but the game is way too buggy on all fronts to be enjoyable for anything other than just the first few hours of exploring new mechanics.AI is so poor and broken, that it keeps declaring surprise wars it can't even hope to win. The agenda system is a cool idea, but it just makes the AI seem crazy when it declares wars over completely trivial things. The AI still can't handle or understand 1 unit per hex tile either, and it's already the third game in the series to use that feature. Higher difficulties rely on cheating, again, but even that doesn't help now since the AI just doesn't understand the new mechanics at all.Multiplayer is riddled with various exploits that are in the game. There's all kinds of production and unit selling related exploits, and also just overpowered strategies that are impossible to counter when playing normally.This game is like it was not tested at all. And it probably was, but they just went ""♥♥♥♥ it, they'll buy anything we put out anyways"".It's a travesty that this game gets 90%+ score on ""professional reviews"". It COULD be a great Civ game sure, EVENTUALLY. That's not how reviewing should work though.

33,150.0,Not Recommended," February 25, 2017",8,"I've played Civ series since the first one and it used to be my favourite game. Now I can tell that it doesn't get any better, actually even worse. New great graphics or 1 good new mechanic does't make the experience any better, when the AI is probably at the same level of development as it was in 90's. To put it simple, the game is very unchallenging, boring and I think it is the first one I actually felt that I am wasting my time playing it when I could be doing more interesting things. Everything comes down to terrible AI.Thanks to the awful AI, Civ 6 gives you only an impression that you have many different tools and that there are many layers in the game but in reality you could be playing against a one arm bandit machine with the same results. AI is basically taking out all the fun from the game. Civ 6 is like a very old laptop put into a new case - new look, with some extra bells and whistles but it is the same old engine. Therefore I feel cheated after paying for this expensive game that doesn't bring much new to the table.Pros- Great new graphics- Newly introduced districts mechanic is very refreshing and I liked it a lot (however it does require some fine-tuning)- City-states mechanic feels better than the previous one (not sure if people will agree though)- New division between social policies and science discoveries is also refreshing and interesting- Regular trade system feels ok (through traders)Cons- All of the above is ruined by terrible AI. The and is the same as it has always been (read: pointless, not working as intended, i.e. not increasing difficulty). It doesn't matter how many guns you will give to a blind person, he/she is still blind!-- AI during and doesn't mater how big army it has. It will send at you any random units, in any random order, disregarding everything that happens around. You have a huge navy parked near his city? It will embark land infantry to sail to/near your battleships. Sometimes I got an impression that AI actually tries to fight my navy with embarked land units (like cavalry).AI will almost never build planes or use them.The usual problem with AI developing in such a way that it is very hard to have a proper war using units from the same era. AI seems to never upgrade units, so expect the usual nonsense battles between pikemen and tanks. Changing speed of the game didn't really help with that (maybe unit queues are still too long? or it just comes down to stupid AI).The whole concept of diverse military units is broken, when AI doesn't know how to use artillery, air strikes, close combat units etc. It just doesn't care what it uses, in which order and how.AI will come into my territory, get hit, pull back, come back unhealed, die without reaching a target. Honestly, it is very hard to imagine what the target could be, because AI moves seem so random. It will randomly embark and disembark units continuously when trying to defend its city (?). It disregards everything: position of my units, their type, number, strength, the target they are hitting etc.- is as bad as it used to be. Absolutely pointless part of the game, filled with ridiculous mechanics. Doesn't matter how hard you try, you will almost always end up being hated by almost everyone around. Deals? If an AI player doesn't like you (soon or later it will happen), it forgets about any economy logic and offers so ridiculously expensive deals that they are not worth it. I understand ""good"" vs ""bad"" deals, but AI seems to be going off the scale like a lunatic. It will have 0 economic power, 0 army and ask (demand) many valuable resources for free. Why? Because it doesn't like. Why? Because you haven't built any plane yet, or something stupid like that, or because you got involved in a war, for which it will hate you for 1000 years.Luxury resources seem to be an important part of the game (keeping society happy) and I see how diplomatic deals could be important here but in the current state diplomacy is almost useless. Alliances bring no benefits, except for some minor trade routes bonuses.- is as bad as it was. Again, AI ignores geopolitical situation. It will build a city, which wont develop much as it is taking those few hexes in the middle of my cities. It just doesn't care that it is settling its people in the center of my lands, i.e. the area surrounded by my cites from each side and while doing so it cuts me off my road. Later I cant transport my units, because AI decided to build a city blocking any road to it.Maybe create 2 different levels of settlements?, so that razing (removing) one doesn't cost you ruined diplomatic relations for the eternity. However, fixing logic when creating new settlements should take the priority.- Spy... so you can have only few spies in the game and when they get caught you have to pay (make a deal) to get them back. Otherwise your ""spy slot"" will be occupied for the rest of the game and you will never be able to replace it with a new spy. So all you need to do is to catch all enemy spies and never let them leave your prison. Catching a spy is not such a hard thing to do and even if it was, still this mechanic is plain stupid. Catching a few spies = no espionage ever... oh my, so real. There should be a price for losing a spy but keeping him in a prison for eternity is a stupid idea.- Culture victory usually happens much before you can profit from modern wonders and buildings era bonuses.. well unless you set the starting era to be much later.- AI seems to be spending fortune in gold buying Great People. It seems to be obsessed with them and rarely waits for the points to accumulate.There is too much of this stuff, so I finish here...- very disappointed civ fan."

83,24.4,Not Recommended," December 30, 2017",8,"As a longtime civ player, I just can't get into this latest version. I avoided the game at launch due to the goofy graphics and the 80$ price tag. After getting it on 50% off, i've tried very hard to enjoy it but I just can't. I'll be trying for a refund but after 30 hours played, I don't think i'll have much luck.It seems to appeal much more to a mobile RTS style of game whereas I prefer the immersion and civ building aspects of the franchise. I also feel like I need to use the strategic view to actually see what's going on on the map. This only emphasizes the mobile aspect of the art style and makes the immersion more difficult, which is ironic because the art style change was suppose to make things more visible and easier to see. I don't feel like i'm guiding a civilization to greatness, everything is a game-mechanic decision to maximize your pursuit of a win condition, routes that are very narrow and linear to chase.For example, civ policy cards are being constantly swapped out based on whatever your next immediate goal is, contrary to any sense of persistent or organic cultural development and, on standard at least, tech and policy advances happen at a very rapid pace. I always disliked how quickly tech becomes obsolete and replaced in the civ games, I always wanted to feel like each era was actually an era you play through but this rapid development (first game the AI hit modern era in 1200 AD) just makes it feel like a mad dash to the end and Civ 6 is much worse than the previous games for this.The new distrinct and wonder placement system feels cumbersome to manage and plan for. With each using a tile space, thus losing the tile yields, and requiring specific hex conditions, it makes trying to plan city placement and the development of a civilization annoying even after managing to learn and remember those requirements. The rate of border expansion is also very slow without specifically pursuing culture or buying tiles outright. It feels more complex than deep, which just leads to ungratifying work on my end. At times the research and policy process felt more like starcraft build progression paths than a civilization growing through the ages, too linear and too obvious.The civs and mechanics are utterly uninspiring. Admittedly much of this was due to not fully understanding all the mechanics and how everything works now but even after reading and watching walkthroughs, I couldn't get excited selecting any particular civ. Many of the civs are hyper specific to a map type or play style and useless otherwise. This kind of sucks. At the least i would have much prefered each civ having multiple leaders that are designed to pursue different win paths so I could play a civ I liked for the historic, aethstetic or narrative aspect. Again, the civ builder in me wanted more immersion and playing a leader or civ that FEELS exciting outside mechanic bonuses would have been nice.Another option would have been to separate the narrative and mechanics from each other more like Stellaris, which has an awesome, though content limited, system. I understand dev choosing civs and abilities based on historic presendent has always been a part of civ (and I do like that) but when it's all about mechanics, it stops feeling like civ for me. Why not allow default civs and custom ones? As a side note, the custom religion symbols are really boring and all of the same animal theme. A wider variety of art and styles here would have been nice. Also, why can't I use an existing religion and just rename it?Seafaring also has little impact on anything unless required on specific map types. Most games, even with coasts, I barely made use of water units(or tiles) other than exploration. Seafaring was a huge part of asian and european development, this isn't at all present in the game and feels really wierd that there is no significant benefit to seafaring.tldr; if you want a mechanic heavy time-sink with an RTS/Mobile feel, civ 6 might be for you. If you want an immersive, historic rich civilization builder, this one probably isn't gonna work for you anymore than it did for me. I think Stellaris or Civ 5 are still my go-to for that type of game."
53,45.7,Recommended," October 20, 2016",8,"I Pre-ordered this game and it was worth it. Though buggy from the start, the developers really tried to bring something new into this game. Coming from CIV 5 there are substantial differences. I do not understand the hate for this game. Maybe they're comparing it to CIV 5 which is for me unfair. The standard should have been what CIV games are about; building multiple cities with your leader and enacting decisions based on what resources you have and against your environment.Pros:1. Better Graphics - Yes, the graphics for me is better in CIV 6. Despite it's cartoonish feel and a side step from the more practical graphics Civilization games had in the past, the animations and the combat graphics are still better.2. Music - The narration of Sean Bean is perfect, hands down to that. Moreover, music is tailored to whatever civilization you are playing so you'll get a variation of sounds.3. A more challenging opener - I don't know why people are complaining that barbarians are everywhere or they spawn everywhere during the game. Isn't that the point? Barbarians pose athreat early on because you are just starting. All the more the reason why you should take outtheir scout once he spots your city.4. Game is still developing - I love the fact they added leaders from African and Asian countries,this was not seen as much in CIV 5 and we have more female leaders as well! In addition, is thedistrict system which is a plus for me at least we have process in how to devise our city. Hence the need for city planning. At least, we have5. Creativity - Your creativity will be tested here. This is not a game for stiff people. Apologies but you will lose if you don't adapt quickly.Cons1. Pace - Pace of the game slows down somewhere between the mid-game to end game and it can be a bit draggy. So it's up to the player how to makes things interesting (which will dependwhat victory route he/she wants to pursue).2. Agenda system - This is such a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ since you'll never know the combination of things to please your AI players. I guess this is part of the challenge, but it may turn offnew players.3.

59,63.7,Not Recommended," November 21, 2016",8,"I'm here from Civilization 4, having skipped Civilization 5 and received this game from a friend (it wasn't free to him, but he did get a game from me!). On the surface there's a fair bit to like. I mean, it's a 4X game. We love 4X games! And there are new civs to hang out with, with special objectives (which, I'm told, was brought out in Civ 5) that make the AIs simultaneously easier to predict and more fun to engage with as a general idea. Inspirations and Eurekas! I can do things to get bonuses toward research! Civics get researched in tandem with techs instead of being unlocked by them! The civs all have something unique about them beyond a special unit and a special building. Who'd have thought you could research new civics by beating up barbarians?!But then there were a few bugs. Not glitches, but stinging insects that got too noisome to ignore, and these are going to make me wait for some major content patching before I'll be ready to hop back in:1. Districts. I hate them. I hate that a single military unit can set me back dozens of turns by burning down a couple of buildings because they were set outside the main city tile. I found this out when a barbarian chose not to run away from a unit that was absolutely going to destroy the barbarian, and burned my university down instead. I hate also that I have to spend a couple dozen turns before I can even *start* building my library and university because I first have to...what. Clear the land for them?2. SCALING COSTS, capitalized for emphasis. The first builder you produce will cost X. The second will cost X+Y. The third will cost X+Y+Z. The same holds true for buildings, districts, all other units, whether you built them with gears or bought them with gold or faith. It's bad enough that I first have to put down an industrial zone before I can start my workshops and factories, but my modern-aged new city will take FOREVER to finish that zone because a few other cities had already built one. This is backwards beyond belief, and possibly worst of all...the game documentation DOES NOT TELL YOU that this is happening! It isn't in the manual anywhere that building a musketman now will make the next musketman cost more gears to produce or more gold to buy.I've heard this is to encourage you to 'build tall' instead of 'build wide', which I assume means to focus your cities so that this one is the commercial city, that one's the factory city, this other one makes soldiers...but, as before, your districts sit outside your city and can be pillaged. Three turns can ruin a hundred of yours.3. Hex grid movement. This one isn't going to change, and I'm willing to put up with it, but ultimately I find I dislike hex grids for how restrictive they are to movement. Further, the game is often very poor at telling you that moving, for example, through a threatened series of grids costs more movement to pull off.4. Builder charges. WTF with builder charges. I heard the reason for them (now you don't have a bunch of buildings sitting around and doing nothing!), but they're bogus (You could just disband them, y'know). The increasing cost of builders, as with everything else, makes builder charges one of the worst mechanics I've seen in a Civ game.5. Roads. They can only be built by trade caravans, but you can't cancel and reroute trade caravans that I've seen. They stop when a trading post is built (seems random to me so far), but there's otherwise no reliable way to get roads between your cities.There are others, but these are some of the most frustrating on the list."

My biggest gripe is the DLCs are not worth the cost imo. I mean if they are worth the price they are asking then the game at launch was worth less the nothing. I mean $60 got you like 15+ leaders and Civs and they want $5 apiece now so if they were worth it, then the game play aqnd engine is worth crap. Seems like a gready money grab to me for something that is not to much to make. If they charged $2 or $3 I would get them but $5 is just twice what the DLC are worth. Wait for a sale and go from there. Civ 5 complete is a great game you can get at a good price for the complete package.

I do like some of the changes in this game but having to get new civs as DLC is beyond irritating. They are slow with their patches. They had a bug where the world tracker would pop up every turn even if you disabled it that lasted 3 patches. I imagine they had bigger concerns, which should make you hesitate in purchasing this game. It was a unfinished product. I hate that there is no ""restart"" option. I hate that it does not save your map settings between matches. So if you dislike your start, you have to reset each individual option.

544,71.7,Recommended," October 23, 2016",6,"Sid Meier's Civilization VISid Meier's Civilization VI is the next installation in the Civilization series. I have played all of the Civilization games from Civilization IV until now. Most of the reviews are comparing Civilization VI to V, so that is what I will do, because this is the game that will replace V. VI has many sweeping differences like the visual style, the district system, diplomacy, government types, civic and technology trees, and even different win conditions. These changes bring new methods to playing that users have to adapt to in order to succeed, for example, city planning is major. City planning can make or break your cities in that you cannot just settle near luxury resources and thrive, you need to have locations for districts, and if you're cunning, have good adjacency bonuses too. Wonders also play a major key in city planning, some wonders require that they, for example, are next to a river that is adjacent to a Commercial Hub (type of district). Now all of these changes bring the question, is it any good, and then, is it any better?+Visual style is refreshing for this series+ Districts and wonders require careful city planning+ Difficulty settings are more difficult than before+ Barbarians are relentless and seem more true to life+ Leaders have agendas that fit ingame scenarios and historical ones, too+ Declaring war must have reason, or you are considered a warmongerer+ Fantastic visuals on leader screens (individual hairs and pores!)+ New score is incredible and enticing. (personally, I like it better than Baba Yetu)+ User interface redesign is intuitive and detailed- Game is difficult to get involved in, more so than previous titles- Visual style is comparable to mobile games- Minor bugs and removals that are apparent (may be fixed soon)- Minor spelling errors (no periods, you instead of your, etc)- Some inconsistenties and weird stuff (dialogue when demanding stuff is the same as when trading)Civilization VI is a new title, released on October 21, and is still getting its footing. It has large shoes to fill for its predecessors and will certainly take some time to get everything in order, with bugs and DLC expansions to fix these issues or lackings. Now, the DLCs are still to come and there are minor issues to fix, so this review can't confirm or deny that it will get better, but it is likely. In conclusion, it is worth the full retail price of USD $60."

91,34.0,Not Recommended," February 19, 2017",6,"Civ IV was the last title worth paying for. Once you learn a decent build order in V/VI there is no point playing beyond the Ancient Era. The game will be snowballing in your favor and the AI will *never* comeback.Unstackable troops and ranged defenders allow you to easily advance through the game with a single ranged unit defending each base. The AI will randomly declare war, throw away 2-4 units and sue for peace.When two AI factions are warring with eachother, wait until a city defense is low. Declare war and annex/raze the city on a single turn. The victim will sue for peace and the attacker just moves on. Rinse and repeat.There is no punishment for these tactics. They will lead to a quick and easy domination win on the highest difficulties while producing only a handful of units.Without stackable units the only way to make the game challenging is to DISABLE WAR COMPLETELY. What a joke. Don't buy."
143,6.6,Not Recommended," October 24, 2017",6,"As some other reviewers mentioned, don't bother with this when you can just get your Civ fix with 5. In comparison, Civ V is far more streamlined than Civ VI. This game adds ""complexity"" in the form of extra micromanagement; turns take longer but I don't gain any enjoyment from that. In particular, I'm not fond of the new city management. It bogs everything down. Happiness, while a bit simple, was far better than this nonsense.I also don't like the new tile management, with placing districts and wonders. Districts is okay, I guess, but having to deal with both districts and wonder placement just takes too much extra effort and foresight. In order to optimize each city, you have to have each tile it currently has and will have planned out for at least a few dozen turns, though 100 or more is ideal. Oh, and how each of those plans fit into your empire as a whole is important too.I feel like I need to start taking notes or make a spreadsheet while playing this game. . . And, to me, that isn't Civ. The franchise has always been on the lighter end of 4x games, particularly if you are playing single player. And that's what I liked: I like being able to open a relatively easy game of Civ to pass the time, or play when I'm tired, or to run while I'm watching a show. It's relaxing. But Civ VI takes that away from me without really giving me anything worthwhile in return.Is this a popular opinion? I don't know. Have I played it a bunch? No. I'm staring at my 6.6 hours thinking about how much crap I'm going to get for a negative review with under 20 hours in a 4x game, but guess what? It didn't take long to figure out that the game just isn't my thing. I have no interest in playing the current game. And, based on playtime, my friends seem to feel the same way.If you like it, well, great! But I can't recommend a game when I'd rather be playing the previous game in the series."

I never really felt like finishing a match, and that is because of the worst part of this game: After you researched and upgraded everything, there is nothing more to it. Its just moving your units around and keep upgrading your cities like you did with the previous 900. The dialogue with other factions in this game is so horrible and limited.

The only way to stop it permanently is to go to war.2. UI is terrible. Very laggy, clunky and counter-intuitive meaning frequent unintended moves.3. The processing is woefully slow. Each turn I spend a minute or so deciding how to counter the religious invasion. A few seconds managing research and construction. Then five minutes waiting for the next turn. This had always been an issue with civ games but is much, much worse with civ 6.If history is anything to go by, religion will most likely be fixed in a patch or upgrade.

19,184.2,Not Recommended," January 30, 2017",6,"In December of 2014, my brother introduced me to what quickly became (and has remained) my absolute favorite video game, and one of my preferred modes of entertainment- Civilization V. As someone who has always enjoyed studying history and playing turn-based strategy games (i.e. Risk), Civilzation V was a dream come true. Because of my experience with Civ V, I was very excited for the release of this game, and (after initially restraining myself from pre-ordering) actually decided to shell out $60 to buy the game shortly after its release instead of waiting for a sale. You can see from the gigantic red thumbs-down next to this post that I was disappointed. Since I bought the game, I've tried over and over again to enjoy it or, at the very least, find some way to justify spending as much as I did on this, but I can never stick with it for very long.Other than how bare-bones this game feels when compared to Civ V (which, admittedly, has had 6.5 years not to be expanded upon), my largest issue with this game would have to be the change in the way players can interact with other civilizations. The diplomacy feels much more superficial and the interactions are much more limited- for example. you can no longer pay a civilization to declare war on another. Also, diplomacy in Civ 6 doesn't seem to be very useful- asking civilization to stop sending missionaries and apostles to your cities doesn't seem to have any effect, other than to give you casus belli when they invariably break their promise by sending wave after wave of missionaries and apostles (which are prohibitively expensive for players, but surprisingly common for AI) to convert your cities back.I understand that comparing a game that had (at the time I purchased it) 4.5 years of enhancements and bug-fixes to a (now) 4 month old game is not going to be a fair comparison. That being said, I don't believe that this game is currently worth the ~$60 that I paid for it. If you are a fan of the Civilization franchise, stick with the other installments for awhile- if you haven't yet played any of the Civ games, I would suggest paying the $45 to buy Civilization 5 Complete, which is currently a much better and more complete game, instead of spending $60 on Civ 6.Since it's 2 in the morning and I'm exhausted, I have to throw this onto the end: I do like the introduction of districts in this game and the emphasis that places on city planning, as well as the separate research trees for technology and civics. I also like the way you have to unlock governments, each of which provide unique bonuses and provide different policy card slots."

They are destroying this franchise, civ5 was poor and this is just much worse.Although - there is scope to fix and improve, there are seeds of good ideas, but they are only useful if the game actually works and the AI is a credible opponent.

894,14.1,Not Recommended," December 1, 2016",6,"If there was a ""neutral"" rating option, I would have picked it. Since there isn't, I went with the thumbs down because of three issues that to me are important and would affect my own decision on whether or not to buy the game again. Decide for yourself if these are aspects that matter to you:- As of writing this, the game still does not have a UI/font scaling option that works with all resolutions. It appears to be available at 4k, but at 1440p (2560x1440) the upscaling option is disabled and can't be enabled by editing the config file. Text and icons are uncomfortably tiny.- No teams. Surprisingly, the co-op option was removed in Civ6. You can only play against your friends, but not team up with them to play against the AI. You also can't form teams with the AI.- The AI is peculiar and has major trouble with combat and diplomacy. Yes, just like in Civ5, though just more so. It also doesn't understand districts well and seems to be mostly focused on spamming missionaries.It's fundamentally a good game and rather promising, but since we pay for games the way they are now, not for how the may or may not turn out in a year's time, I gave my recommendation based on the game as it is (it's not an inexpensive game).

196,451.5,Recommended," October 20, 2016",6,"After my first few hours, I can say that this iteration certainly feels more involved than the previous. The city state bonuses are a much welcomed improvement, with enough variation between them that they have a fairly significant impact on each game. The fact that envoys in city states are permanent and you don't have that annoying notification ""no longer friend/ally with city state"" that prompted you to splurge more gold to keep the benefit is gone.Combat feels much the same as Civ 5 - I haven't experimented with the new corps feature yet - only to protect settlers and builders.Having a military early game suddenly became a whole lot more important. Where I used to just sit back and build wonders, you can't do this any longer because you will either get stomped by an aggressive opponent (surprise war) or barbarians will just amass and sack you.The 1-more turn feeling is very much alive."
121,520.1,Not Recommended," October 27, 2017",6,"This game has no quality control whatsoever. Every 3 months a patch is released which usually introduces just as many easy to discover bugs as it fixes. For example in the summer patch a bug was introduced where an opponent would present you with a deal but would act like you presented it to them and they diapproved of the deal. If you clicked the ""Propose"" button the AI would accept it. This doesn't happen occasionally, it happened every single time. I think this particular bug has been fixed but if the devs spent 5 minutes actually playing the game they would have caught this bug. In the fall patch that was released a week or two ago starting spawns were broken. So if your civ was a coastal sea-faring nation you could find yourself on a single tile of snow in the middle of the ocean.Wait maybe 6 months or so and maybe the devs will stop being dumb and actually fix this nonsense."

Long gone are those times. I wanted to give the Civ 6 team the benefit of the doubt after they basically saved the previous iteration from the initial disaster. I got the Deluxe Edition, and waited... played some 400+ hours, nothing compared to the thousands in previous iterations, and waited... did some modding (CQUI), and waited some more, only to be met by the Summer ""patch"". I have to say that, from my point of view, the latest Summer ""patch"" is the worst in the franchise's history bar none. Never before has a civ patch not only fail to fix glaring bugs that existed for months, but also introduced new ones, some of them plain shameful. Such disrespect for the customer base and the fans can only be met by one sentence: DO NOT BUY. If you still want to give Firaxis the benefit of the doubt, wait until the customer base has a final veredict, probably only after the cosmetic DLC's cycle is over, and perhaps the expansions are out. Wait, until either Firaxis betters the quality of their updates, or the price drops so far down to be consistent with the present quality of the product. Wait. Wait and see."

472,49.1,Recommended," February 28, 2017",6,"Disclaimer: Since there is no ""Maybe"" option for ""Do you recommend this game?"" I am putting ""Yes"". I really mean, ""Yes, for people who LOVE a challenge and who want to play the latest Civ game.""I've been playing Civ since number 2, which I spent an absurd amount of time playing during my formative years and I love this series to death, but I have no idea how I feel about this game. It feels like an abusive relationship that I can't escape because I just keep believing that the game will treat me right if I just do it better next time...and then it slaps me in the face again and tells me to shut my mouth.I love some of the changes and additions they made to the game such as making you think about placement of cities, districts and improvements because it has a huge impact on your future, the change to governments and the civics tree, technology and civics boosts, and the improvement of trade routes and trading posts. I especially love the changes to city states and the awesome bonuses they give you for becoming suzerain/sovereign of them.On the other hand, I don't understand how they think the AI is coded correctly in any way. They will declare war on you for no reason, constantly refuse requests for friendship even if they are ""friendly"" toward you; and once they are at war with you, they will barely assault a single city (usually just my capital so far). I've just sat there and picked off troops one by one with my city defenses as they just stand outside my city not attacking it. Meanwhile, the civs I'm not at war with denounce me because they think I'm a warmonger, when all I've done is DEFEND my cities and never once declared war on anyone!It's nearly impossible to appease any of the other civs. First impressions of you? Negative; almost always. Have more positive numbers going for you than negative in the relationship window? They're still unfriendly toward you even though the math they show you on screen should put you at neutral or above. Pumping all of your resources into culture? Brasil, who likes civs with more science and culture than they have (and hates those with less), still won't like you because you're dumb and have less science than they do. After Montezuma finally grew tired enough of waging war on me and not winning (because he barely sent any troops and they just stood outside my gates), he offered me peace and a TON of his luxuries. Which would be great, except that his main personality trait is that he hates anyone who has more luxuries than him/luxuries he doesn't have yet. So...he made peace and completely set himself up to get mad at me again later.Also, barbarians are insane. I spent ALL of my time until the medieval era trying to get rid of them and they still were everywhere; I could barely get anything built in my cities! Now if they spawn near horses, they have horsemen. And they have scouts that report back once they see your city and get the barbarians to come attack it. I only got to play long enough to get to the modern era after turning them off.All of my above experience has been on the standard difficulty. Maybe I'll try one of the wimpy difficulties and see if I can just crush the civs that will become a pain before they grow powerful enough to matter.Firaxis, PLEASE fix the AI in this game. I love this series and hate to see ""features"" that are just clearly bugs. I can't possibly fathom how you coded it so that the pacifistic defending civilization can be seen as a warmonger. If my feelings on the game change I will update my review, but for now my relationship with Civ VI remains...strained."

Iv tried civ 6 over and over again, hoping that it will be decent. But it isn't. It is horrible.There are several bugs, even now months after release. The AI had no improvement at all since civ 5. AI spam units, while throw them at you for free experience. The game has way less content than civ 5 overall. The victory types seem unbalanced, especially religious units that can easily be picked off by military. Your choices seem to make no difference. Diplomacy is either random or illogical. The new amenity system and how more cities increase district cost meens u have to make cities in stacks of 4 (4, 8, 12, 16 etc) and with no posibilty to arange amenities yourself. Worst off all i find how overpowered military is. This is especially true versus AI, as they can't controll their units at all. But also against players, the fact that cities have no defence, and even when upgraded they can be taken down by just a pair of soldiers. Also while districts become more costly after number of districts you got, units is always same price. You will have a hard time going all out for science, while you can produce millitary in every city with no problem at all.All games are done in king or higher difficulty"

Mods do make this a lot more bearable however.I have to talk about the reason that pushed this review over the edge, the DLC. Civ 5 introduced DLC perfectly but this game proceeds to add very similar ""Leaders"" (not always a different empire) for an extremely high price, with minimal benefit or change to the game itself. It was a real shame, I have loved this franchise ever since the 3rd game and this one has put me off a bit due to the pure lack of care and attention.If you are looking for a change to Civ 5 and can get it on sale, then go ahead, although do be warned about the poor AI and weak multiplayer...EDIT: With the recent announcement of more paid DLC it shocks me to see that they realise how broken the game is, but only offer to fix it via a PAID DLC.

If you don't own Civ 5, buy that instead, save money and enjoy a game that is much much better. My hope is they will realize how bad Civ 6 is, go back to Civ 5 and improve on the AI, graphics and increase the ability to engage in diplomacy (one thing Civ 6 does right) as well as improvements in empire management.

There is honestly a lot to like about Civ 6 and as a core the game is good. Chances are you've heard what the najor issues are but here is what I think is right and wrong with the game:-The game is impressive graphically and I really like the art style, however I would say it isn't better or worse than Civ 5 just different-Districts are a nice additon to the game as well-Barbarians are no longer a nuisance and now can be an oturight threat to your progression in any given game, killing them provides certain inspirations and eurekas which help development of the tech and civics tree but ultimately they're not that impacting in a positive way-Most Civs tend to either be focussed toward being a warmonger or nothing in particular, having versatility can be a good thing but I also feel that this further enphasizes being a warmonger. Most of the games I've played tend to be kill everyone or endure their petty complaints-The AI agendas whilst promising in nature for some variation in diplomatic goals basically almost means you're hated by everyone since you can't do the abitrary things they want you to do. Even when you do fulfil them other civs hate you or the fulfilment isn't recognised (I've had mulitple 'money grubbers' tell me it's great my economy is doing well one turn to then tell me 20 turns later my economy is terrible even though it hadn't changed in that time). When one civ declares war on you it tends to make others do the same even if they had no reason to and the friendly with them until that point-Like previous titles I was expecting that we would receive additional content through expansions containing signifcant updates, but given the announcement and release of Macedonia and Persia I think that content will just be drip fed through to the community as one or two civs as dlc. It would be nice if game was given some more substantial expansion as seen in Civ 5In short I can't recommend this game in it's current state"

The fundamental structure of city management has been upended in a new interface that is overly complex and difficult to tinker with. And the boosts system, while a clever idea, was poorly executed; making gaming the system simultaneously too easy and almost impossible. Even the classic civilizations’ leaders have been tinkered with. Who thought it was a good idea to replace Napoleon with Catherine de Medici? There are some positives. The new way workers construct things makes developing a region a lot more flexible than in the old Civ games. But there are far too many negatives, like how roads are built by trade, NOT workers.

77,25.2,Not Recommended," October 22, 2016",15,"This is a soft ""No.""Civ 6 has a lot of interesting new features. In previous titles, units with 2 movement could move across one flat terrain tile and then move to a hill tile. In this game, each tile now has a movement cost associated with it. A unit with 2 movement points could move to a flat tile, but must wait until the next turn to climb a hill as they only have 1 movement point left. The movement point pool is a compelling feature that drastically affects combat and scouting.The new 'Builder' unit is also a compelling wrinkle. In previous titles - and in most strategy games - 'Workers' could be built to improve tiles in your empire. They were permanent and lasted throughout the game. Firaxis chose to make the new tile improvement units limited in scope; they can only improve three tiles before being expended (four with Pyramids). It's a neat feature and forces players to break up production lines.An upgrade to the grid overlay is a much needed improvement. Players can visualize the tourism and religion effects of their civilization, as well as other civs. There is even an overlay to show the value of certain city areas and where cities can be built before you send out your 'Settlers' (who have 3 visibility now, WOOT!).The game is mostly a callback to Civilization: Revolution which is both good and bad. Everything is much more cartoonish and, despite the efforts to put detail into the unit models and the leaders, represents an infantile recognition of the game, and our, history. Catherine de Medici has the strong features of Asuuna Yuuki (Sword Art Online reference). There are landmarks that offer bonuses when discovered, which is good encouragement to scout instead of building up a massive army. I liked Civ:Rev - especially the random unit promotion feature and landmark naming - but this interpretation does that game no justice.Even the characters are given anachronistic and inaccurate treatment. Hojo Tokimune, a man who is credited with formalizing the establishment of Samurai and Bushido, who dominated his government, who lived during the mid-1200s, is equipped with a feature titled 'Meiji Restoration.' The Meiji Restoration began in the mid-1800s and effectively destroyed the Shogunate in favor of incorporating Western ideologies and technologies.The UI is beyond bizarre in its design. Civ IV and Civ V were special in that the player's access to systems interaction were large and obvious. In Civ 6, all of these buttons got the Harry Pym treatment and are incredibly small. Even their placement is the product of some deluded mind. If you want to check on your political standing with another leader, then check one of the aforementioned map filters, you are going from top-right to top-left parts of the screen. In previous games the left side fo the screen was most frequently interacted with: it contained research, city lists, unit lists, and unit information. The unit information sits beside the 'Next Turn' button, which can be convenient for finishing a turn but detracts from the management of your Civ.Units can't enter an 'Alert' state, which fortifies them until they see an enemy, in Civ 6. This was a valuable tool in protecting against barbarians and other attacks in previous titles. It's beyond annoying that this feature is gone.Oh, and want to set up a production queue? That's gone, too. Really, of all the things Civ 6 thought to ""improve"" upon, it was removing the building queue. How ridiculous. Now I have to sit down with a pen and paper, writing down my queue and scratching things off as they're created. Dumb.All-in-all, not the worst sequel. Firaxis jumped the shark with Civ IV, but this game is a nice addition to the series."

Some Eurekas! can be triggered a full fûcking 3 ERAS before they're even remotely relevant, such as the one wherein you need to build a niter mine. Meanwhile, others require you to use or build units that you literally ONLY JUST UNLOCKED! The system is just so göddämn fûcking tedious and inane that it becomes a complete bloody chore to use it! To make it even worse, many Eurekas! are based ENTIRELY on luck, like discovering a natural wonder or another continent, meaning you'll be FORCED to waste time on researching just 'cause you weren't lucky enough to start in a very specific kind of position!Moving on with my gripes, the game/match settings for Civ6 are NOWHERE NEAR as extensive as they were in ANY earlier Civ game. No longer can you choose just how aggressive barbarians are or that players only get to have one single city to control. Hell, you don't even have access to ONE THIRD of the world/map types you had in Civ5! You also can't randomize personalities for AI players like you could in Civ5 (not that it matters THAT much though, since they're ALL going to do NOTHING BUT DENOUNCE YOU anyway!)Adding to that, there's nowhere near as many civilizations to pick from as there were in Civ5, and granted, Civ5 didn't have all that many without DLC/expansions either, but it still had more than #6 does. Which brings me to another point of hatefulness: the fûcking bullshït excuses for DLC this game has. Even the WEAKEST of DLC-packs for Civ5 had some value, but the ones that're available for Civ6 are literally WORTHLESS. None of them has any weight or value, nor add anything to the game itself. They're bland, cookie-cutter money-grab type DLC that's literally just there to make you waste your money on that shït. And yes, I know that DLC is meant to make you throw money at the game, BUT FOR THE LOVE OF TÏTS, LOOK AT THE MOTHER-GÖDDÄMN-FÛCKING DLC-PACKS FOR CIV5! Those damn things were actually WORTH buying!On the note of how shïtty the range of civilizations is and how slim the pickings are, the City States are even WORSE, somehow. If you're new to the concept, City States were introduced in Civ5, and acted like small, autonomous mini-players. They had one city, a few units for defence, and a slew of various ""traits"" which affected their behaviour and what kind of requests they made to you, which in turn affected your relationship with 'em. They actually added something to the game, and they became especially critical to your success in Brave New World, when they acted as diplomatic support in the World Council thing. But in Civ6? They basically pump out endless streams of units, have NO personalities, NO ways of interacting with them other than sending envoys (which's essentially just a different dress for the same system of giving them gifts of gold in Civ5) and declaring war on them.In Civ5, you could: give them gold to significantly boost your relationship with them (but nothing else); give them a unit which only granted a minor relationship boost but gave them a (potentially) invaluable unit for defence; give them a gift of 200 gold to instantly improve a luxury or strategic resource and thus giving you instant access to it (in case they had a source of uranium or oil they didn't extract yet); or declare that you're protecting them, which in turn increases their resistance to demands from other civs AND raises their relationship's ""resting point"" (i.e. lowest point it decays to). You could also: demand tribute from them in the form of gold; enslave their citizens to use as workers; declare war (of course). There were also a great deal of religious/cultural aspects that improved the benefits City States grants you. So yeah. WAY TO ♥♥♥♥ING GO, DEVELOPERS. YOU TOOK A COMPLEX AND INTERESTING SYSTEM AND MADE IT ENTIRELY USELESS TO THE GAME!Another thing I HATE!!!!!!!!!!! about Civ6 are the wonders, not least of all how EXTREMELY poorly balanced they are. Chichen Itza has been rendered completely and utterly useless, as all it does is ""improve jungle tiles"" in a pathetically weak way, and ONLY for the city it's built in, which is (as I mentioned above) COMPLETELY USELESS. Only a mega-retärd keeps jungle tiles intact rather than cuttin' them down like the garbage they are and replacing them with tiles you can actually IMPROVE. See, for absolutely insanely dumb reasons, you can ONLY establish a lumber mill on a ""woods"" tile, so jungle tiles can't be improved AT ALL. They'll never give you more than their base yields! Yeah, 'cause the deforestation in the Amazons yields no useable lumber WHATSOEVER.Meanwhile, other wonders are INSANELY overpowered, like Huey Teocalli, which grants +1 Amenities (basically ""happiness"") for EVERY lake tile adjacent to the wonder, AND an empire-wide boost of +1 food AND +1 production for ALL lake tiles. Doesn't matter where in the empire the lake is, it gets the bonus. Or Big Ben, which grants a whopping +6 gold per turn, +3 GPP for Merchants (look it up), AND +1 Economic Policy slot. AND IT ALSO DOUBLES THE AMOUNT OF MONEY YOU HAVE WHEN IT'S COMPLETED. NAH, TOTALLY NOT OVERPOWERED.Even worse is the fact that wonders (for some retärded reason) are as big as an ENTIRE CITY now. In Civ5, all the wonders you've constructed WERE represented visually in the game, but they were ONLY ""small"" (but realistically sized) visual indicators that there was indeed an Oracle or Eiffel Tower present in a city. In Civ6, however, EVERY SINGLE ONE of the wonders takes up an ENTIRE tile. ""Fine"" for the pyramids, maybe, but NOT for the Colossus or Sydney Opera House (which're are admittedly huge, but when compared to an ENTIRE CITY, they're tiny specs AT MOST!) So yeah. That makes NO FÛCKING SENSE WHATSO-GÖDDÄMN-EVER.Moving on, the casus belli system is a nice addition to the game, IF it swung both ways. But sadly, it does not. AI players NEVER EVER EVEN ONCE need a casus belli (i.e. excuse) to declare war on you, but if you declare war on ANYONE without a casus belli, even your allies which're being actively tormented by the dowdy barbarian fûckwits you're now attacking will HATE YOUR GUTS. They'll denounce you and keep doing so basically for the rest of the game, all because you're bound by rules that NONE of the AI-controlled players have to abide by.So yeah, nah, there's a few things I like about Civ6, like the ""update"" on the policy system and the re-introduction of governments in a fresh way, and the way traders create roads automatically when traveling between cities, and the fact that workers are ""consumable"" units now (which makes them less likely to get captured), but the good bits are far too brief or insignificant for me to really recommend the game. Sure, MOST of the extremely shïtty design choices in Civ6 COULD potentially be fixed in future updates to the game, but honestly... what do you expect? Firaxis hasn't been good AT ALL since they released Brave New World for Civ5. This game is a hopelessly worthless title, and if I hadn't such a ridiculous resistance to mediocrity, I wouldn't have played it AT ALL past the 5 hour mark.Buy Civilization 5 instead. It's better in (almost) every single way. 33/100"

However, these developments are completely overshadowed by the bugs and parts of the game that straight up don't workIf you put a unit on alert, it doesn't wake up when there's an enemy nearby. Information on the GUI doesn't update real time and usually is only accurate a turn late. A quarter of my clicks either don't register or register incorrectly (the game thinks I've lifted the mouse button when I haven't). It jumps around between units in a completely random order and on top of that it sometimes jumps when you're in the middle of giving a command to a different unit, causing your scout to walk into a group of barbarians instead of away towards safetyI honestly feel bad for the people who paid full price for a game that may as well been made by a middle schooler.

Having already purchased it, there is little else I could really do. I'm currently taking advantage of the bugs, to learn about new features and explore options, that I perhaps wouldn't focus on, if the game was the completed product, albeit, ready for patches and DLC to make it even more complete.I can forgive, annoyances with say the interface, such as the great people screen, not being formatted and aligned properly and minor bugs, but this game has a really big bug, that should never have been present or by now certainly should have been fixed. The biggest bug for me, is the AI's non use of sea and air units, even if they build them. This means that certainly in the mid-late game, you don't need to really worry about them being capable of launching a threatening attack against you. The most threatening attacks seem to come from the Barbs in the early part of the game.One thing this does show, is that those who reviewed the game, particularly the mainstream press and gaming website, certainly haven't played it enough, if they have given scores above 6 or 7, with such a major bug being present.There are other issues, such as Science being an easy victory to achieve, even by someone like me who is an inexperienced player who can achieve a victory by turn 350 on normal play.Forget people who moan about the artstyle, graphics do not make gameplay and gameplay is what matters here. Unfortunately at the moment, gameplay while fun is equally frustrating and unless bugs are fixed, I can see myself just getting bored of the non challenge and going elsewhere.A real shame, because I really was looking forward to CIV VI, but at the moment, I can't recommend buying it."
55,45.5,Not Recommended," November 21, 2016",4,"I have 300 hours in Civilization V, so I can tell you my general first impressions of this game.1: The districts added to the game seemed to add a sense of depth that was important and very crucial to city building, however it seemed pale in comparison to what it was aiming for. The overall city-building aspect seemed diminished overall because of the sheer power early game has potential for.2. Early game overpowers everything by far. If you don't have about 20 tiles between you and the nearest competitor, one of you can easily get facerolled by the mass production of low-level troops because cities no longer have their ability to attack units within 3 units of their hexagon, meaning that four warriors can just blatantly mass siege a city with little to no penalty for waiting long durations of time, unlike in Civ V where if you fortified and waited outside of an enemy's city, regardless of size, they could retaliate with little attacks to, at the very least, wittle you down, but it was very significant early game.3. AI is terrible, as usual, but this is exceptionally terrible compared to previous Civilization games due to the added depth of the Civil tree and Technology tree, as well as trying to determine when to build districts vs when to build regular improvements via builders, and they seem to only focus roughly 80-90% of their resources on ""improving"" themselves, but I have personally seen people have Settlers for over 50 turns sitting in a single tile at their city center, but I am not sure if it's because they can't find suitable land to settle a city on or if they are just uncertain of how to settle a city.3.1 AI seems to denounce randomly. If you declare one war and win or take anything of value, it will almost always have a huge penalty for the late game which usually involves every single AI in the game denouncing you and then eventually declaring a massive joint war against you due to ""Warmongering."" However, typically, they are very unmilitarized so you can defend very well unless you completely abandon all of your cities and leave them completely defenseless.4. The art style has caused a lot of various flak and such, but overall, I didn't mind it too much since I run on a more low-end PC. However, the art style feels very cartoonish, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but it constantly feels like the map is extensively crowded. I cannot exactly pinpoint this issue, because Civilization 5 has moments where it feels more crowded, but something about the icons makes it feel very condensed and unreadable, and I believe it is because you cannot zoom out as much. Not really a huge issue, but still a complaint that didn't help the game overall.5. The separation of the Civics tree and the Technology tree as long as the added addition of the policy cards seem more like a tag-along for ""added depth,"" when in reality they just feel poorly designed overall, more specifically the card system. There are some cards that are overall better in almost every situation, especially early game, and do not harbor any benefits that can be established from the overall diversity of other cards. For example, the first two military card options you are able to choose from are recon units gaining more experience from exploring, or bonus damage against barbarians. Due to the very oppressive presence of barbarians, it is almost never a good idea to choose recon experience over the damage to barbarians. Not only that, but to level up any unit requires a turn where the unit is required to be dormant, meaning you have less time to actually explore, and in the early game where recon units are most impressive, you should always be competing to find tribal villages to jumpstart technologies and gain advantages. You can argue that in the long run, bonus recon exp pays off, but if barbarians have the opportunity to pillage your lands and stunt your growth, late game doesn't matter anymore because you simply don't have one, you're just another city waiting to be plundered at that point. And barbarians can very well utterly obliterate someone at the beginning to hinder their growth dramatically and leave them well open for invasion, and it can be a case of bad RNG from barbarian spawns. This also ties into how hard it is to defend cities early game.Overall, I'd say the separation of the Civics tree and Technology tree wasn't a bad idea, it was indeed a very GOOD idea, but the execution with the addition of cards seems very poor and needs a rework or overhaul, or at least tweaking. Balancing issues are overly abundant with early game civilizations have very obvious advantages due to the ability to mass spam units and faceroll an advantage.I paid $80 for this game, which is part of the reason I am very disappointed. Even if I had just paid the flat $60 for this game alone and not the future DLCs, I would have expected at least some bit of reassurance that my money wasn't entirely wasted due to unreleased content. It was fun in some moments as a relaxing, casual game, but overall, it provided little to no challenge due to the AI difficulties being additional cheats for the AI instead of actual reasoning or tweaks to the situational awareness.Within a few patches, I believe this game will be far more enjoyable, but don't buy it at full price unless you plan on waiting a few additional weeks to months for quality gameplay."

What were they even going for here? ""Pixar does claymation""? ICK.--Oddly boring gameplay. Empire-building tasks like planning roads and guiding an army of workers have been all but removed and replaced with district management.--District management is not fun. It feels like playing multiple instances of a dumbed-down version of Simcity all at the same time.--Random AI behavior.

I could tell this game didn't have half the charm Civ 5 did the first half hour of playing it. This disgusting display of♥♥♥♥♥kissing only warants a negative review from scorned, disgruntled customers. I gave it a chance, I really did, and I really wanted to enjoy it, considering I paid the extra for the deluxe edition.Some stuff I do like, like the art style and managing districts as efficiently as you can think of, but so many game mechanics seem to have been decided upon simply for the sake of being different from Civ 5, for example changing ""jungles"" to ""rainforests"", or ""amneties"" instead of ""happiness"", and other such unnecessary changes.First Civilization Beyond Earth, now this.

It's worse than 5. Civ's expand badly, pick wars then send 1 unit at your cities to die, sue for peace, and if you dare start a war be prepared to be labled a warmonger 1200 years later for that one skirmish you had.It makes diplomacy in this game useless. The AI on any difficulty just picks fights even when you do everything they want. they settle in ridiculous places and will march settlers halfway across the map and resources to settle next to you with their second city (never share info with the AI as it just tells them where you are faster).I'm sure this will be a good game given some patches and work but at present the game just isn't worth getting till they sort out the AI, diplomancy and some other issues."
230,8.8,Not Recommended," February 12, 2017",4,"I'm a little shocked that I cannot recommend Civilization VI, given that I have played every game in the series (almost religiously) since Civilization II.While I feel there are numerous positives to this game, there are also far to many drawbacks for me to recommend this product. The most glaring issues, from my perspective, are two things:Aggressive ExpansionWant to build tall? Do you dream of establishing a small, powerful empire that can stand the test of time? Well, you best keep dreaming. In Civilization VI, since there are no penalties for founding cities, more cities = more bonuses. The game requires you to focus on expansion until there is simply no land left to colonize. If you do not make claiming everything around you your number one priority, rival civilzations will become too large to effectively deal with. While I have no issue with playing wide, it is frustrating to be forced into playing a particular style during the early portions of the game.Arbitrary LeadersWhy does Cleopatra hate me? Am I not tall, handsome, or Italian enough for her? She's on the other side of the world, yet she randomly sends letters telling me how much she despises me.The AI in this game is exhausting to play against. Not exhausting in a 'difficult' way, it is exhausting in a 'it's-not-paranoia-if-they're-actually-out-to-get-you' type of way. In Civilization VI, you would be wise to assume that everyone hates you. Yes, . Did you just meet Queen Victoria? She hates you. What does that telegram from Teddy Roosevelt say? He's just reminding you of how much he hates you. Did you just see Gandhi waving at you from across the border? He's waving goodbye to you, because he completed the Manhattan Project 20 turns ago and the guy loves thermonuclear induced winter.At the end of the day, Civilization VI has potential, however it lacks the magic of previous entries in the series. When I play this game, I do not feel like I'm going on adventure into the unknown with my empire. Too many gameplay elements make my decisions feel predetermined, which makes me no longer wonder of what lies ahead for my own civilization.Stick with Civilization II, III, IV, V, or even Alpha Centari."

However, what concerns me most is the AI.Or rather, the lack of it. AI is sluggish, incapable of waging war or planning, and too easy to conquer. Yes, it will take time, but only in my early plays did I encounter any difficulty at all. I play on Emperor now and I'm not *that* good at Civ, so something's amiss. Invading civs still send piecemeal armies - basically harrassing you and achieving nothing other than annoyance.The diplomacy is taking a lot of fire, but there's a lot of potential here. The personalities of the leaders are welcome, and the game does a decent job of showing those priorities. The wonders, districts, and general gameplay is different and innovative enough to make it a good game, just not one I'll play for hundreds of hours until the resolve the AI. Yes, the UI needs work. Yes, some of the nitty-gritty about districts is too hard to find or non-existent.The bare bones of a great Civ game are here. I love the potential, and I can tolerate the foggy UI, but...Just fix the AI, Firaxis. I don't care about any of your DLC, and if you want me to buy Civ VII, show me you can give me AI that can put up a fight and not roll over like shamed mongrel.So I do NOT recommend it, not until they patch the AI and perhaps flesh out the UI and a few other systems.

94,470.6,Not Recommended," April 22, 2017",4,"Okay so here goes super long OTT review of the game as it stands following the release of all the early expansion packs. (TLDR: I think the game is okay, which as far as the franchise is concerned is a worrying and terrible thing)A lot of the reviews on here so far have focussed heavilly on the obvious progress made since Civ V and the blatant balance and AI issues at launch. While all these points are valid and I understand the frustration at investing a hefty chunk of money into a game which arguably doesn't work, I was willing to believe the devs would quickly rebalance these issues. They have had time, they have released the bonus content which I paid a premium for and from here out, any additional content will see them asking for more of my money. Here is my balanced assessment of the 200+ thoroughly unfulfilling hours I have invested in this game so far and why I won't be rushing to pay for any more content for this game.Firstly, the good. Considering how BE was such a mess, being too similar to Civ V and lacking the historical anchors to immerse the player in I totally understand the need to overhaul a lot of the game. If nothing else can be said about Civ VI it is definitly a bold step forwards from where the final edition of Civ V ended. New approaches to city placement which has a footing in how cities were historically founded as well as added complexity from the requirement to place districts and wonders on the map adds a whole new strategic dimension. I like this, Civ is a strategy game and increasing the ammount of trade offs which occur when decision making is absolutely a good thing and something which should be commended. No longer are you just plopping cities based on nearby luxuries, there are a whole plethora of factors to consider and districts such as the aquaduct and entertainment complex add further variety to this. The other major improvement is in combat, particulary in attacking cities. You can use combat units far more freely now and if your civ specializes in a certain unit, you're pretty much at liberty to use that unit to lead a campaign with. This is IMO a great progression from Civ V where in every SP game my army consisted of pretty much the same setup of one meat shield, one fast (with medic), 2-3 ranged and as many siege as I could maintain. Presently, if I have abundent horses, I then I will use horsemen en masse, if I have iron, then knights are the dish of the day, if I have nothing, then I wait for catapults and go that route. This is FUN! Combat is a big part of the game and added diversity is a great direction to take the game down (however there are issues I will address) Military progression also ties in nicely with the other major overhaul of the game which is the tech and civic (culture) boosting system. Gaining tech boosts from how you play the game is a nifty addition. Want to boost archery? You'll need to get a slinger kill. Want to rush crossbowmen? You need to have 3 archers. This again removes a bit of the linerarity from tech progression as you no longer find yourself beelining for writing > philosophy > education etc. Because it pays to research techs you have boosted you often find yourself playing off of the situation rather than a prooven formula. Finally, the last major improvement is the added wealth of ways to find marginal gains through micromanaging your empire and planning out every minor detail using the card system. The increase in the ammount of game changing decisions you can now make is a lot of fun when playing off the higher difficulty levels and I have enjoyed tweaking the civic queue to squeeze the maximumm potential out of each decision I plan on making. All this combined with vastly more diverse civs each with historically linked playstyles gives the game a great framework to build on.Now the bad.. Ohh so much bad... I'm just going to get this one out of the way first of all because I can live with a broken AI as you play around it. What I cannot cope with however is the brutally abhorent sountrack. A game of Civ can last 5-10-15 hours depending on speed setting. During this there is almost no variety in what you hear and what you will be hearing is a distracting and bombastic muddle of rythem and repetition which I would liken to dropping a bucket of golfballs on a xylophone. Its really weak and they will almost certainly not fix this even though it sets the tone for the game as being a bit of a joke. Yuck. Visually it seems too that they decided to step back the realism and make the overworld look slightly dull, 8 replica tree sprites represent a forest, the fog of war is almost indescriminate from much of the terrain and much of the terrain is daubed in a ghastly pallette of orange, yellow, light orange and brown with the odd splash of green. Like a door with a handle you have to push to open, this just smacks of bad design and I am still having to constantly hover over certain tiles to determine wether or not the terrain is a hill as forest hills are almost impossible to spot without displaying yields. I consider these to be the biggest issues as they will almost certainly never get adreesed and patched even though the vast ammount of mods altering the colour bias implies I do not stand alone here. Next is the smoothness of the game as it plays. I skip a units turn, I hit end turn, there is a pause, I have to then return to said unit, skip turn again, hit end turn again, game realizes one unit stil has movement points left even though it can no longer move where I want it to so it hovers over this unit until I hit spacebar, then it cycles units again then I hit end turn again then the AI moves and I have to navigate repeated requests to engage in diplomatic actions I have no interest in doing, then my next turn starts but I have to wait for 3 screens of diplomatic news about what economic policies my opponents have decided to pick up (Knowing AI is using ""press gang"" policy is hardly game changing knowledge) then I can finally move again. This is a MASSIVE dent to the fluidity of the game and over an epic game speed playthrough will easilly add an hour onto the game time than if the round ended when I hit end turn and I was allowed to engage in diplomacy on my terms. An example of this from my last game was that Norway wanted to ""be friends"" because I happened to own 3 boats which got him all excited. I refused as he was being a bit of a jerk to others on the continent but he asked again, every turn, for the next 30 turns. I denounded him in the end just to put an end to it as I couldn't bear hearing the same scriped lines anymore but I felt it was kind of lousy making diplomatic decisions based on the length of time it takes to finish a turn. My other big issues are pretty dumb things that I'm sure will get fixed anyway given time. As it stands right now horse units outclass mellee and ant-cav in every aspect which is a bit of a shame because ideally you want the units to work in a sort of rock paper scissors format where melee looses to range, range looses to fast units, fast looses to anti cav and anti cav looses to melee. As it stands in the game so far, everything looses to fast horse units and until we see a promotion at least where melee can attack into rough terrain and anti cav this will be the permenant order of things.Finally a word about the DLC packs, Maybe I was being naive but I bought the extended edition under the assumption that I was getting all DLCs to come with the game. Turns out no, and while I can understand that patches like BNV and G&K were game changing I feel totally scammed by the flimsy extra few civs that were lumped into each dlc drop. If there is one thing I hate its base game content withheld as dlc and shame on firaxis for mugging their loyal fanbase with this cheap skullduggery. All in all I'm probably going to put thid game down for good and I think I just hit the word count so t"
40,77.3,Not Recommended," October 25, 2016",4,"(This is a very early review for Civ VI on a Mac.)I've owned literally every version of Civilization there's ever been -- starting with Civilization for DOS, then Civ for Windows, CivNet... I think I even owned the weird Activision rip-off version that came somehwere around the time of CivNet and Civ II.In all those years (around 25), on all the various computers and operating systems I have tried to play it on, none of them bleeding edge systems, believe me, this is the very first version of Civilization that is unplayable due to performance issues out of the box.I'm currently using a four-year old (almost to the day) iMac. While this is obviously not a thoroughly modern computer, it's not a relic from another era either. It can't run Civ VI even with all of the graphics features turned off or set to their lowest quality. The most glaring example is that to give a unit a command to move you have to wait up to 3 seconds after right-clicking on a hex before the computer responds to the command. By three seconds I literally mean counting out loud: one-one-thousand, two-one-thousand, three-one-thousand.... This is appallingly bad performance, it's actually shocking to me that it has been released in this state. This is the performance of the game in the first 20 turns; I can only imagine how awful it gets once the map is populated with cities etc.Most likely this is a Mac port issue and PC's are seeing better results. That's just a gut feeling.To compare, Civ V runs perfectly well on my iMac. As do most other games I play (Diablo IV, Starcraft II, X-COM, etc.) So, no, I don't feel my computer is in need of replacement, I just think this is some really bad coding.UPDATE: Having given up on playing this game on my iMac, I installed it on my MacBook Pro, which has somewhat better specs. In particular I discovered the game recommends 1GB of video memory; the iMac has only 512 MB and the MacBook Pro has 1.5 GB. The MacBook Pro easily exceeds all the required technical specifications.I hoped that I'd find the game fully playable on the MacBook Pro due to the greatly increased video memory. If anything the performance is worse, with all graphical options on minimum. To give a single example, I just executed a move order on the second turn of a brand new game and counted one-one-thousand all the way up to seven-one-thousand before the game responded to my mouseclick. Seven seconds -- on the second turn of the game! Disgraceful.UPDATE 2: (Just trying to keep it real by communicating what I learn as it happens...) I discovered how to lower the resolution to the 1991-era 1280x786 (or something like that). There was no noticeable improvement in the performance of the game at this archaic, eye-bleeding low resolution, so one begins to suspect the problem is not the graphics card at all but just really, really brutally bad coding."

I'm sure there is an order of magnitude error in warmonger penalties. It makes the game unplayable. I tried avoiding this and it is possible but makes for a very boring game - basically you need to be in a globally dominant position before going to war and fully self sufficient. No sneaky deals with CIVs saying one thing and doing another with back channels. It all very dumbed down. Very sad it seems that the makers or this game have basically cashed out. Dont buy it or wait for Mods to fix these issues.

168,113.9,Not Recommended," January 15, 2017",4,"There's a fair amount of criticism of this game regarding its graphics, pacing, and how the UI obfuscates the game's new features like districts and city-planning.Most of these can be fixed by subsequent patches and expansions, much like Civ V was. However, what concerns me most is the AI.Or rather, the lack of it. AI is sluggish, incapable of waging war or planning, and too easy to conquer. Yes, it will take time, but only in my early plays did I encounter any difficulty at all. I play on Emperor now and I'm not *that* good at Civ, so something's amiss. Invading civs still send piecemeal armies - basically harrassing you and achieving nothing other than annoyance.The diplomacy is taking a lot of fire, but there's a lot of potential here. The personalities of the leaders are welcome, and the game does a decent job of showing those priorities. The wonders, districts, and general gameplay is different and innovative enough to make it a good game, just not one I'll play for hundreds of hours until the resolve the AI. Yes, the UI needs work. Yes, some of the nitty-gritty about districts is too hard to find or non-existent.The bare bones of a great Civ game are here. I love the potential, and I can tolerate the foggy UI, but...Just fix the AI, Firaxis. I don't care about any of your DLC, and if you want me to buy Civ VII, show me you can give me AI that can put up a fight and not roll over like shamed mongrel.So I do NOT recommend it, not until they patch the AI and perhaps flesh out the UI and a few other systems. Wait and see how Firaxis fixes their game, or what the modders eventually do with it."
8,147.7,Not Recommended," December 18, 2016",4,"DISCLAIMER This review talks about single player and singleplayer only.This is not a bad game, HOWEVER it is missing some major features. For example, if you set up a game and start it up and dislike the start, then you can't restart the game with the same settings, you could do this in Civ 5. Here, if you dislike your start, than you'll have to return to the main menu and redo all your settings (such as difficulty, game pace and victory conditions.) Civ balance is terrible as in my opinion there are only a couple that are enjoyable to play as (Germany, Kongo) all the others are boring or awful (Sythia is good but boring to play as past the classical Era). The devs suggested that we'd have a true start map in the base game but we don't, they most likely want to squeeze money out of us in expansion packs.The diplomacy agenda system is screwed up because civs like India will start to dislike you for not having nuclear weapons in the ancient Era and you won't be able to fix this until the atomic Era but by then they will have denounced and probably declared war on you (their agenda is BS India has declared 3 formal wars on me without nuking me). Another problem is that if a Civ starts to dislike you, then it's very hard to turn the relationship around. I do like the new government system but 90% of the civics are useless. I also think that satin himself invented the religious victory as it is by far the most frustrating victory I have ever won and it just made me want to pull my hair out.This game isn't all bad but I wouldn't recommend it until it gets cheaper and they patch the game up."

It's worse than 5. Civ's expand badly, pick wars then send 1 unit at your cities to die, sue for peace, and if you dare start a war be prepared to be labled a warmonger 1200 years later for that one skirmish you had.It makes diplomacy in this game useless. The AI on any difficulty just picks fights even when you do everything they want. they settle in ridiculous places and will march settlers halfway across the map and resources to settle next to you with their second city (never share info with the AI as it just tells them where you are faster).I'm sure this will be a good game given some patches and work but at present the game just isn't worth getting till they sort out the AI, diplomancy and some other issues."

121,280.0,Recommended," November 23, 2016",4,"I admit, the game is not where it should be. There are still bugs and balance issues a month after release. With that said, it's still a great game and it improves on the features that Civ 5 had. Here are a few of my favorite improvements:City States - They are much more interesting now as they each have a unique bonus as well as the bonuses you get for multiple envoys. Also there are more types (i.e. scientific and industrial). There is a great variety of quests the city states will give you which I really enjoy. Overall, the city states add alot more depth and character to the game than they did in the previous game.Great People - Another big improvement in a similar fashion. Each great person has a unique bonus. For instance, one great merchant may give a unique luxury, while another one may increase tourism, etc. Also there is a window for viewing the next available GPs and who is likely gonna receive them. You have the option to purchase a GP with faith or gold if you want to grab them before anyone else! This adds another layer of depth to the game and it's alot of fun.Governments - You have the ability to change your government, which houses different types of policy cards. This gives you the ability to customize your government according to what you have researched so far and and you have the ability to change your policies frequently. This is very different from the static policy trees of Civ 5 and it gives you alot more flexibility.Overall, I enjoy the game more than Civ 5. If you're still unsure about the game, then wait until it gets ironed out more with patches. Otherwise, what are you waiting for? Grab it while it's on sale!"

Wait a few years, get everything for like 20 bucks and hopefully a playable AI at that point.Just a small update. Nothign has changed. AI is stil garbage. The game itself has nice features but that is pointless when the AI is horrible. Go check out the forums for civ 6, half of them are usually about the horrible AI.Update: A year later...Its still garbage. The AI can somwhat but not realy still build (without massive cheating settings), the combat is the horrible still. One example, I have two bowmen and 1 warriors and the enemy city has One bowmen. I souround the city, what does the AI do? he takes his bowmen out of the city to attack my bowmen that take a step back and of course it dies leaving the city with no defence. All the AI had to do is stay in the city and target the warrior, it would have been 100% the AI's victory. Also, it was a proud announced by firaxis of a patch fix that the AI will now work to get goodyhuts. Not true, they ignore them all the time, walking right past them. Even in diety, the AI hands you its settlers to you for free cities by walking them into/near your starting zone.I also notice more political propaganda slipping into the game. As in the past, I ignored it if the game was good but this game stinks. SO glad I did not buy the DLC's and DO NOT buy the expansion coming up. Whats the point if the AI can't do ANYTHING right.Sorry for the somwhat long review."
94,470.6,Not Recommended," April 22, 2017",4,"Okay so here goes super long OTT review of the game as it stands following the release of all the early expansion packs. (TLDR: I think the game is okay, which as far as the franchise is concerned is a worrying and terrible thing)A lot of the reviews on here so far have focussed heavilly on the obvious progress made since Civ V and the blatant balance and AI issues at launch. While all these points are valid and I understand the frustration at investing a hefty chunk of money into a game which arguably doesn't work, I was willing to believe the devs would quickly rebalance these issues. They have had time, they have released the bonus content which I paid a premium for and from here out, any additional content will see them asking for more of my money. Here is my balanced assessment of the 200+ thoroughly unfulfilling hours I have invested in this game so far and why I won't be rushing to pay for any more content for this game.Firstly, the good. Considering how BE was such a mess, being too similar to Civ V and lacking the historical anchors to immerse the player in I totally understand the need to overhaul a lot of the game. If nothing else can be said about Civ VI it is definitly a bold step forwards from where the final edition of Civ V ended. New approaches to city placement which has a footing in how cities were historically founded as well as added complexity from the requirement to place districts and wonders on the map adds a whole new strategic dimension. I like this, Civ is a strategy game and increasing the ammount of trade offs which occur when decision making is absolutely a good thing and something which should be commended. No longer are you just plopping cities based on nearby luxuries, there are a whole plethora of factors to consider and districts such as the aquaduct and entertainment complex add further variety to this. The other major improvement is in combat, particulary in attacking cities. You can use combat units far more freely now and if your civ specializes in a certain unit, you're pretty much at liberty to use that unit to lead a campaign with. This is IMO a great progression from Civ V where in every SP game my army consisted of pretty much the same setup of one meat shield, one fast (with medic), 2-3 ranged and as many siege as I could maintain. Presently, if I have abundent horses, I then I will use horsemen en masse, if I have iron, then knights are the dish of the day, if I have nothing, then I wait for catapults and go that route. This is FUN! Combat is a big part of the game and added diversity is a great direction to take the game down (however there are issues I will address) Military progression also ties in nicely with the other major overhaul of the game which is the tech and civic (culture) boosting system. Gaining tech boosts from how you play the game is a nifty addition. Want to boost archery? You'll need to get a slinger kill. Want to rush crossbowmen? You need to have 3 archers. This again removes a bit of the linerarity from tech progression as you no longer find yourself beelining for writing > philosophy > education etc. Because it pays to research techs you have boosted you often find yourself playing off of the situation rather than a prooven formula. Finally, the last major improvement is the added wealth of ways to find marginal gains through micromanaging your empire and planning out every minor detail using the card system. The increase in the ammount of game changing decisions you can now make is a lot of fun when playing off the higher difficulty levels and I have enjoyed tweaking the civic queue to squeeze the maximumm potential out of each decision I plan on making. All this combined with vastly more diverse civs each with historically linked playstyles gives the game a great framework to build on.Now the bad.. Ohh so much bad... I'm just going to get this one out of the way first of all because I can live with a broken AI as you play around it. What I cannot cope with however is the brutally abhorent sountrack. A game of Civ can last 5-10-15 hours depending on speed setting. During this there is almost no variety in what you hear and what you will be hearing is a distracting and bombastic muddle of rythem and repetition which I would liken to dropping a bucket of golfballs on a xylophone. Its really weak and they will almost certainly not fix this even though it sets the tone for the game as being a bit of a joke. Yuck. Visually it seems too that they decided to step back the realism and make the overworld look slightly dull, 8 replica tree sprites represent a forest, the fog of war is almost indescriminate from much of the terrain and much of the terrain is daubed in a ghastly pallette of orange, yellow, light orange and brown with the odd splash of green. Like a door with a handle you have to push to open, this just smacks of bad design and I am still having to constantly hover over certain tiles to determine wether or not the terrain is a hill as forest hills are almost impossible to spot without displaying yields. I consider these to be the biggest issues as they will almost certainly never get adreesed and patched even though the vast ammount of mods altering the colour bias implies I do not stand alone here. Next is the smoothness of the game as it plays. I skip a units turn, I hit end turn, there is a pause, I have to then return to said unit, skip turn again, hit end turn again, game realizes one unit stil has movement points left even though it can no longer move where I want it to so it hovers over this unit until I hit spacebar, then it cycles units again then I hit end turn again then the AI moves and I have to navigate repeated requests to engage in diplomatic actions I have no interest in doing, then my next turn starts but I have to wait for 3 screens of diplomatic news about what economic policies my opponents have decided to pick up (Knowing AI is using ""press gang"" policy is hardly game changing knowledge) then I can finally move again. This is a MASSIVE dent to the fluidity of the game and over an epic game speed playthrough will easilly add an hour onto the game time than if the round ended when I hit end turn and I was allowed to engage in diplomacy on my terms. An example of this from my last game was that Norway wanted to ""be friends"" because I happened to own 3 boats which got him all excited. I refused as he was being a bit of a jerk to others on the continent but he asked again, every turn, for the next 30 turns. I denounded him in the end just to put an end to it as I couldn't bear hearing the same scriped lines anymore but I felt it was kind of lousy making diplomatic decisions based on the length of time it takes to finish a turn. My other big issues are pretty dumb things that I'm sure will get fixed anyway given time. As it stands right now horse units outclass mellee and ant-cav in every aspect which is a bit of a shame because ideally you want the units to work in a sort of rock paper scissors format where melee looses to range, range looses to fast units, fast looses to anti cav and anti cav looses to melee. As it stands in the game so far, everything looses to fast horse units and until we see a promotion at least where melee can attack into rough terrain and anti cav this will be the permenant order of things.Finally a word about the DLC packs, Maybe I was being naive but I bought the extended edition under the assumption that I was getting all DLCs to come with the game. Turns out no, and while I can understand that patches like BNV and G&K were game changing I feel totally scammed by the flimsy extra few civs that were lumped into each dlc drop. If there is one thing I hate its base game content withheld as dlc and shame on firaxis for mugging their loyal fanbase with this cheap skullduggery. All in all I'm probably going to put thid game down for good and I think I just hit the word count so t"

Just keeps booting me back to the main menu, with no mods installed whatsoever.I can of course load the benchmarks, though. I get to see that my system could run this game at full spec with no issue. I'm super glad to know that but again, I'd have preferred to learn that by actually playing the $50 game I just bought.I should have guessed that, with their history, Firaxis would release a patch to conincide with a sale that completely broke their own game, mods or no.I shouldn't be surprised but I am.

157,523.7,Not Recommended," August 5, 2017",4,"There are many good things about this game, as I actually put almost 300 hours into it at the time of writing this. City building system is nice, graphics are cute, civs are more unique than before, etc.However, the problem with this game is you can't really play it. In singleplayer the AI of Prince which is the only fair AI in the game is totally dumb, declaring wars for no reason only to lose them in a couple of turns because of no war plan or threat assessment. All AIs beyond that just receive unfair advantages to make up for their stupidity - like they get 2 warriors at the beginning while you get only 1, they develop better than you because their economy is boosted etc. Eventually they end up spawning the whole map with units until you start lagging horribly.You can't really play multiplayer either because it's totally unstable, with random kicks even from the lobby before the game starts, ""joining error"" messages, ""the game is full"" messages while it actually isn't, and random crashes. And when you're lucky and actually able to play multiplayer, you find it has nothing to do with building a civilization - it's a warmongering PvP where the only thing you'll ever build or care about is military and the only civs that people play are good at early game military. Hence the strategy discussions about the game are basically ""how to get many legionarries and a great general ASAP as Rome and then own everyone?""Another frustrating thing is that it's been almost a year since the game's release and all Firaxis does is releasing small bits of content as DLC and charging additionally for what should have been part of the basic game.

98,70.9,Not Recommended," December 3, 2016",4,"The addition of districts is a good concept. However, once you build them you need to build additional buildings in each district. I like this feature as well. The reason for the negative review is that you can really only build up about 4 cities before it is suddenly 1900. I understand Civ 6 wants the focus to be on specialized cities but in the real world, countries/cities did not each just focus on 1 or 2 things to accomplish by the 1900s. Everything in game should be able to match real world timelines because after all, the roots of this game was about progressing through history which early Civ games accomplished. I always feel rushed or behind. It doesn't matter whether you choose standard, epoch or marathon. All this provides is the benefit of more turns to move your explorers and soldiers around while the pace of research and constructing still falls behind unless you only focus on specific research paths or only a couple of districts. Throw into the mix that you have to waste turns to create builders more frequently along with everything else and you will feel like you are in the stoneage by the time you reach WW I era. Additonally, I have 3 other complaints. The AI is horrible. You meet another Civ, next turn they want open borders. Seriously, is that how it works in the real world? You make a trade agreement and the very next turn the civ you are trading with denounces you because you have more great people then they do. My nextl comlplaint is about the starting positions. Choose continents and you will always get slammed in between 2 other civs right next door. Choose islands and you will always start on a tiny island where you can only build 2 or 3 cities. Choose any option and you will always start in an area where if you move 8 tiles in any direction you will hit snow tiles which are totally useless. Last, when a settler is created the recommed build here option chooses ridiculous locations or if on an island there will sometimes be no recommendation at all because the entire area is crap. Civ 6 is a huge step backwards from Civ 5 which is what I am returning to."

678,41.2,Not Recommended," December 22, 2016",4,"This might be way more worthwhile after either the developers, or modders fix the serious amount of problems plaguing the gameplay.Civ6 isn't a game about building a Civilization - it's just a bog-standard war game now. Attacks from both barbarians, and other in-game Civs, are endless. The combat AI is particularly bad - your enemies will normally just march to their own suicide, having declared a war they could never have possibly won.The AI in general is the poorest I've seen in any Civ game to date. Civs will declare war on you regardless of your strength, or theirs. The earliest war I've had declared on me so far was on turn 3 - we both had one warrior to our collective names. I just sat my warrior in local territory, on top of a hill. The AI then just started attempting to pump out any war unit it could, and trickled each unit one-by-one to their death. This went on for about 80 turns.Firaxis attempted to bring back the ""points"" system which showed you why a Civ liked/disliked you. For example: you'd get a +5 bonus for having the same type of government, or a -5 penalty if you settled too close to them, or got caught spying on them, etc. The problem is, this is a complete placebo effect. It doesn't remotely alter how a Civ feels about you. You can be on +50 for positive actions, and they'll still denounce you, or declare war on you, or simply refuse to trade with you. If it wasn't for the AI being so terrible in every other department, I'd almost think this was a bug.Maybe pick it up if an expansion is released which purely focuses on just fixing the AI. Until then, stick with Civ5."

231,12.8,Not Recommended," February 8, 2017",4,"I can honestly say since Playing Civilization since the very first Civilization came out in the early 1990's that this is the first civilization game I do not like. I only played it a few hours as I like to start on the lowest level so I can try and understand the game. I was able to beat Civ V on Deity level eventually and other Civilizations on higher levels as well. Within the few hours playing this game I like other reviewers found Barbarians to be the toughest Opponents out there. This new luxury way of keeping cities happy is ridiculous. Even at the lowest level I found my cities contantly revolting and spanning tons of barbarians. The barbarians were coming at higher tech levels than me even with Helicopters and such. I was so swarmed by barbarians (even after shutting barbarians off in the menu- making it even more ridiculous) that the game was unplayable. When I shut off barbarians I think I should have no barbarians not even from cities revolting which seems to be a constant thing in this civilization game.One of the other big problems I have with the game is the concept of builders. You build a couple things like mines, etc and the builders just go away. I don't want to have to spend my entire game constantly building builders (workers I mean) when I could be working on wonders, buildings , military , etc. Workers have been a constant in all the Civilization games until now. I want my workers to last the entire game so I can have hundreds of them out building mines, plantations, roads, etc. I don't want my workers (excuse me builders) going away after three builds and I have to spend time building them again. If my workers are captured that's one thing but constantly having to build new ones is irritating.This game I feel is the most unplayable Civilization game ever and I wished I never bought it. If you want to see how much I hated it compare my Civizliation 5 Playtime of over 800 hours to my measly playtime on this one. I really like some changes in Civiliztion 5 like shorter playtime so I can play a game in 2 hours to completion where civilization 1 and 2 a good game was 12 hours at least (which I had more time to play back then). I also really liked Civilization 5 in being only able to have 1 military per square which made combat more interesting. Also if I shut off barbarians in Civilization 5 I didn't have any and it was much easier to control cities (though not as easy with the happiness as Civilization 1 and 2).Civilization 6 in my opinion is an unplayable and unfun game with cities constantly revolting at low levels and having to constantly build builders. And I have been a huge fan of Civilization since it was first released. I feel this is the first Civilization game not worth playing."

As if that wasn't bad enough, Firaxis has decided to follow an absolutely moronic DLC plan. Instead of large expansions that add new features, they release small DLCs that have 1 civilization and some scenarios no one ever plays. Firaxis has ultimately turned to microtransactions and are selling things no one really wants.The only redeeming factors is the district system which adds a city builder aspect to the game.

252,432.6,Recommended," October 22, 2016",4,"Civ VI is a fantastic addition to the Civilization franchise, from its gameplay tweaks, additions, and aesthetics. It is also surprisingly more polished than previous Firaxis releases, which is a big plus!One of the first things you hear is Sogno Di Volare, the game's AMAZING new theme. For longtime Civ fans, it's by the same person who composed Baba Yetu for Civ VI. The rest of the game's soundtrack is equally as impressive as the theme, especially as you get into the later eras of the game (your civilization's theme progresses as you do)!Anyone who didn't like the lack of depth of Civ V upon release won't be making the same complaints here. Religion, Tourism, and Trade are in base game, and at their full potential compared to their representatives in Civ V. The new District system makes planning ahead that much more important, and a lot of other changes to existing mechanics allow more decision-making and specialization to how you play (for instance, all Great People and City States have unique bonuses)! My personal favorite feature, Espionage, is back as well - it's much more in-depth than in Civ V, and anyone who's played Civ IV will be delighted to know that the mechanic is back in its full glory.Concerns about the game's cartoony art style are subjective - I personally find it helpful in quickly identifying what exactly is on the map. The minimap could be improved, as it's a bit difficult to discern certain things at the moment.Some negatives - the UI is laid out a bit oddly, although I admit that I can't pinpoint what's exactly off with it. It looks like some tooltips are missing as well, such as where Tourism is being generated. The auto unit switching has a delay and can switch even after you've selected another unit, which is annoying. These are all minor complaints, however.The game is very well optimized - I had a low-mid-range laptop rig (2.4 Ghz processor, Nvidia 640M) and can run the included benchmark at ~48 fps average on low-medium settings.Multiplayer is mostly flawless - there was a bug I encountered in a game lobby where it appeared there was an ""unsupported amount of players"" when there really wasn't. Also, for some reason, some turn processing times take very long. Zero crashes or desyncs for me so far!Overall, I am very pleased with this iteration of Civ VI - it a lot more gameplay mechanics in a vanilla release, along with a great soundtrack. This is a very high recommendation for me!"

Also, the game interface is very annoying. I dig the map concept, but there should be an option to ""black-out"" undiscovered terrain on the map. Also, there needs to be more contrast between the land your units are on (that you can see what's going on) VS the land you discovered that your units aren't on (and can't see what's going on).

I have thousands of hours of gameplay, and a couple of hundred with this version in particular. With II, III, IV, V, I would come back over and over and over, and play ""just one more turn"" until the wee hours of the morning so many times I couldn't possibly remember them.This game hasn't yet compelled me to play ""just one more turn.""

165,304.0,Not Recommended," March 28, 2017",4,"Game has been a real disappointment so far despite the early promise it showed. Some of the new mechanics are interesting but there is so much that has been poorly implemented or inexplicably omitted from what the devs should have learned from Civ V. The new UI is comparatively horrible vs. the old one, the AI is generally horrific (With higher difficulties just shoe-horning stupid bonuses onto the AI civs and debuffs to the player rather than representing any real difference in AI), AI forward settling etc is out of control and much of the interactions between players and NPC's is just gamey and broken, religious warfare is hugely spammy and annoying with religious units taking up tiles which other units then can't occupy which again leads to a spammy mess and on top of all of this they absolutely screwed digital deluxe customers HARD. Even at full price the game had a piddling discount on the game + DLC's in the pack but both the game and the DLC's have been on sale repeatedly since. I for one will never buy a Firaxis DDE again and feel pretty peeved at how this has been handled.Additionally to the above the patches have been EXTREMELY slow in coming, which is a huge disappointment.

After playing through several Civ 6 games, I feel like it wants to be a great game... it just can't quite get there. I like all the design changes, the districts, the mini-stacks, the concept of national parks, etc. The reason I can't recommend it is the poor AI around Settlers and City Planning. In it's current state, it makes the game almost unplayable, which is a shame considering what it has to offer in other areas.My experience comes from playing a variety of different Civs on standard, small, and tiny map sizes. I played on prince difficulty at standard speed.AI civs don't seem to look for sensible plots near their own capitals, at least they don't prioritize them. In all my games, AI civs go out of their way to build right on top of the non-AI controlled player. On a tiny map, I watched both AI Civs on my continent send their very first settlers all the way across the map so they could attempt to settle right on top my capital. They ignored perfectly legit locations near their own capitals to do so. In other games, I fought to build up a matrix of cities over time, only to have AI settlers swoop and plant doomed cities in the tiny gaps where I intended my cities to eventually expand into.As a player, I do like to leave some space between my cities so they can grow. That's sort of the whole point, unless your Japan with their bonus. These aren't big gaps mind you, and I still end up with overlapping tiles in the end. However, if you attempt to plan ahead early on, your city placement will result in some temporary gaps between your cities. AI Civs seem to go out of their way to exploit these gaps. It's like the AI is going out of it's way to jam you, almost to point of ""griefing"".You can't stop this diplomatically. If you open your borders, then you're going to get settler spam. The only way to prevent this is go to war. You can do this proactively by having scouts look for encroaching settlers, and picking them off before they can build. This is a great way to farm settlers, but it's not mechanic I want to be ""forced"" into. If you aren't proactive, then the AI is going to settle right on top of you eventually. You'll be forced to raze their poorly planned city in order to expand your own, earning a hefty 3x warmonger penalty for your efforts. Dealing with this persistent settler spam is a big reason why I'm constantly flagged as a ""warmonger"" in my games.There is a great game in here somewhere, and I hope it comes out down the road. They just don't have a winning AI formula yet."

If Firaxis has no desire to really give feedback on fixing those, they would be smart to release the modding tools so that the community will do their job for them. They seem to be of the opinion that mods will cut down on their DLC sales. I would put forth to them that if a mod keeps interest in your game going, players are more likely to BUY your DLC. Especially if it requires it.I'm saddened to have to say this about this agem as I love the civ games.

The district system is weak and just results in bloated cities with no real purpose except whatever one thing you want from them. For whatever reason, they decided to make builders expendable. This seemed like a good call at first, adding some depth to an otherwise autonomous unit. It is a worthless and detrimental feature however. All it does is ensure you constantly run out of builders or require you to dedicate one of your cities to almost constantly producing them which takes away from your civ as a whole.

CIV VI is badly optimized when running in full glory,which is the way it meant to be played.

This game comes from a historic franchise and is hyped as an AAA video game,but in reality it looks worse than its predesessor,plays worse than CIV V and it doesnt live the hype at all.

Plan ahead- Workers: workers now have 'uses', and will build instantly but will be expended after their uses are up. You need to build more workers as you go, not just go a whole game with just those workers you captured at the start.I can only recommend this game, this next paragraph is adressing the mindset of many bad reviewers.Every Civilization game had to suffer the ""last civ was better""-disease. Many of the bad reviews are from people that played Civ 1 and Civ 2, and are of the impression that the series gets worse and worse. They are however just being nostalgic. Games change and evolve, some people can't handle new and improved.Civ 4 many remember with love because of the great score 'Baba Yetu', and the game really had a much more modern feel than the previous 3.When Civ 5 came everyone lost their mind because with it they apparently messed everything up (they didn't). Hexagonal tiles instead of squares!? What sorcery is that!? Too many changes at once, and most were confident they'd always prefer Civ 4 before Civ 5. That soon changed and now everyone's cheering for their one true love Civilization 5 and how much better it is than this garbage that is Civ 6 (it's not garbage, it's awesome). When Civ 7 comes out, we'll hear great tales about how fantastic Civ 6 was and so on, so forth.tl;drSid Meier's Civilization VI is great, I've spent over 300 hours on it and looking forward to spending many more!

53,424.4,Not Recommended," October 22, 2016",11,"The game is very disappointing.First of all, the interface is horrible. On the main map the tooltip system is just a misunderstanding. You don't know if the tile is improved or not and need to wait far to long for a tooltip. City screen, nightmare. City states menu, nightmare. Auto selecting units leads to many misclicks. No, no, no. Sometimes you need to click ""X"" to quit the screen, sometimes esc is working. To finish this missery, no ""start again"" button.Second, the game. The pace of the game is much slower than before, I would even say lazy. Strategic resources? I played for 12 hours and don;t know what are they for. Religion? Useless. AI? Stupid as never before. Barbarians? Tons of them, but don't worry, they mostly just wonder around the map and run away if are hurt. Wonders? Mostly useless.Any goods?I would say that the new district system may have some potential, leading to more specialization of cities.Best news?They will probably publish a lot of patches and dlcs, so the game might change."
53,62.7,Recommended," January 6, 2017",9,"As someone who has put in almost 300 hours into Civ 5, I was very excited to play the next installment of Civ. When the initial gameplay showcases were released, I was instantly against the art style and the direction that the game was taking towards looking more cartoony and the exaggeration of the leaders. The change in art style actually led me to wait to hear from the community and friends if the gameplay was good enough to overlook the art style and if the game itself was an improvement from Civ 5. After 30 hours, I can honestly say it is. It took a couple of hours for me to finally get used to the art style, and a large reason for this is because the actual game is good. Nevertheless, the game is not perfect. The UI, in my opinion, feels more disorganized than Civ 5 and it does tend to clutter the screen, especially in the later eras of the game. However, the game is overall an improvement from Civ 5 and I do not regret my decision to buying this game.TL;DR Pretty good 7/10 would buy"

The huge map is smaller than the Standard maps in Civ 5.3) you cannot zoom out in the map overview (guessing it is to hide how small the map is)4) The map for explored but out of site is hard to read and the art choice does nothing for me (overly complicated pencil sketch5) Tech tree unfinished, by this i mean that the descriptions of teh individual techs are lacking, the background is uninspired and i have no idea what the numbers that appear at the bottom of the tech tree are for.6) Culture tree - same as tech tree.7) While i like the idea of tailoring the government style, it again feels unfinished, there are no images for the cards, just a colour. their is no commitment requried, everytime you get a new culture research stage you can change your government style for free.8) Religion, as soon as you can create apostles you can max out the religion, no sense of developing your religion.9) Diplomacy - as already mentioned the animation can not be bypassed without cancelling the whole interaction. the AI does nto seem to take into account your current situation when threats are made, identifying when promises are kept or broken keeps getting it wrong. I declared war onmyself 3 times in one game!10) many little glitches, that should not have made it into the final game, an example I built two different buildings for the 3rd building in the religious district.11) The combat AI is terrible, I ecided to go for a domination victory on a small pangea map, as suliman i was able to capture all teh capital cities while still in the BC area, rather than defend their capital cities the AI sent all the forces to attack my capital, or atleast they left my attacking forces alone, then dissapeared when the city fell. The combat AI for the Apostiles is better than for the aremd forces, at leat they track down and attack enemy religios units.12) game is too easy.I will give this another 3 months before trying to play the game again, to see if it is playable, in the mean time i am going back to Civ 5"
43,8.6,Not Recommended," October 24, 2016",174,"First: I like Civ VI and think that it has the potential to be the best in the series. However, there are a few reasons I can't recommend it right now.1: The AI is godawful. You thought the AI in Civ V was bad, next to the Civ VI AI however, it looks pretty smart. I think part of the reason the AI is so bad is because they fleshed out the cities into districts. This requires a large amount of planning, something the AI is incapable of. You often find the AI settling in places where they won't be able to take advantage of their district placement. In the event the AI settles a city in a good spot, they place the district in random (it might actually be a RNG controlling this) places where it serves no purpose. When you get into wars with the AI, it is PATHETICALLY easy to fight and EXTREMELY predictable. The AI is only a challenge in wars when they have a sheer numbers/tech advantage, and I don't mean one civ, I mean like a 3v1 where they have one tier unit above you. In higher difficulties the AI units deal more damage, which doesn't actually make it any harder, it just draws out wars because the AI is so stupid in the first place it won't do anything with them. The AI also doesn't get rid of units, so if it never gets iron, you can bet there will be warriors attacking your infantry.2: UI/tips are awful. The UI, while cleaner, is more confusing because you have to click 3 buttons where you should only have to click 1, and the tool tips are absolutely no help. I had no idea how to mannually open my government tab until the medieval era. The tool tips offer no help. Oh, you put a city under siege. Ok, what does that do? Oh, the garrison won't heal (I had to look this up online, it wasn't even in the civlopedia).3: Wonders: I HATE how the wonders take up a tile now. This seemed like a cool idea in theory, but in practice it is just bad. Espesially now that you have to build districts, you are REALLY pressed for tile space. Oftentimes, the wonder isn't worth it anyway.4: The split of the tech tree into science and culture. Again, something that sounds really cool, but was poorly implemented into the game. The rate of advancement can be rather...skewed sometimes. With the eureka moments, you can often get almost all techs in half the time if you plan it out, which is crazy.I have no doubt that the game will become more streamlined and simpler after some patches and maybe and expansion or two, and the game is really fun as is. However, I cannot recommend it in its current state unless you are a big fan of the civ series.Verdict: 6/10, not enough cowbell."

The AI will however be as up to date as you.Secondly, irritating AI.Merely existing causes other civs to declare a war against you, or to denounce you. Simply put, absolutely impossible to please the AI.Thirdly, horrible AI.The AI for instance barbarians, will suicide on your troops.If you liked Civilization 5, I strongly recommend not to buy this!!In my personal opinion, the cartoony graphics and lack of animations excused by being more modding friendly is a lazy excuse for wanting to do less work for your game."

There are a lot of people that have been playing this series for a long time, and have a lot of bad stuff to say every time.The DLC is not overpriced: It is priced basically the same for this game as it was for Civ 5, based on content. Big whoop.This is the first Civ game I've played myself and owned. I used to follow a lot of people playing Civ 5, and many of the Paradox grand strategy games. It's good, its digestible.You can play Civ 6 for a little bit of time, or a long time. You can play your epic game, or you can play a fast game.The recent changes to the religion system are a step in the right direction. It's not -bad- anymore. But it is still very cluttered if you're trying to do more than one type of fight, and especially on more than one fight.Civ 6 definitely has its flaws, but that doesn't mean its bad. It's definitely fun enough to get your moneys worth. I'd reccomend getting it on sale or in a bundle, as I'm a little regretful for paying what I did for it. Then again: I've spent WAY more for entertaintent, if we break this down on $1:1 Hour of Fun ratio. I'm definitely going to be putting more time into this, so overall its a good buy.It is at the very least a nice starter for this grand strategy style of gameplay."

They don't fix anything they just put new dlc for 20$ with one/two civs.Maybe after 2 big expansions and nice mod it will be playable just like Civ 5 was.Worst thing is that there is no good big mods for this game. Nobody cares for it.Pros;- fog of war- new graphic design- districtsCons:- No civs balance (some are worthless some are OP)- UI (its clunky, there is no city view like in other civs, the is no building queue and many more small things(some of them are modded)).- AI ( single player is just unplayable)- diplomacy options - lack of thereof- diplomacy with AI civs- weak balance for buildings, resources and upgrades- game is more random than strategic.

83,27.9,Not Recommended," November 19, 2016",9,"The UI is incomprehensibly bad. I've never seen so many different screens and overlays with so little information.Also, like a lot of big budget games, this suffers from long loading times and bloated sluggishness all around, regardless of hardware specs.I'd really really like to love this game, as I have Civs 1 through 5. Like its recent predecessors, maybe this will also improve with another $50 worth of expansion packs and DLC. Still, the bugs and poor design choices make me wonder if anybody actually tried playing this game before they sent it out the door. The AI is pitiful. On the harder difficulty, there are just more units and more cities, bu making the same facepalm decisions. The wealth of new diplomacy options just makes the AI deficiencies more apparent. And for all the detail poured into the animated leaders and foreign language voiceovers, you'd think somebody would have noticed that the actual gameplay sucks.And c'mon, isn't it about time we had an 'undo' button in case I accidentally march my garrison out of my capital just as the enemy surrounds it? What with the buttons scattered all over the screen, this is not so uncommon. Actually, I'd rather just let em have it than load the autosave and have to listen to Sean Bean go through that exact same intro yet again.A lot of the mechanics are new and interesting, yet poorly documented. Be prepared to spend some time on if you want to differentiate between the ones that are truly broken and the ones you just aren't understanding properly. No small number of government civics just flat out don't work, but the descriptions are so vague, you'll have to wade through pages of forum posts to figure that out for sure. Maybe I'm just getting old, but it feels more like a chore than anything else. Occupy yourself elsewhere for now and check back next summer."

At first glance it’s very good.But… it has a major unacceptable flaw : a totally messed up AI.I won’t make a list here of all the problems noticed, but it totally breaks the game. The AI is completely uncapable of wagging wars, sends 10th of unit at you. But they are not upgraded and move around your cities without attacking. (this is 1 flaw, there is much more…).You can easily win at the highest difficulty level, just knowing that you have to build early a decent army (archers), resist the first attack of enemies (easy if you built the archers because the AI doesn’t know how to attack).

383,7.6,Not Recommended," February 8, 2017",7,"Product received for freeFull disclosure: I received this game as a freebie with my video card. I have not agreed to review it in exchange for my copy, nor have I entered into any other agreement with Steam, Firaxis, or anyone else besides the standard EULAs.Now to business. TL;DR: If you thought Civ V with all DLC was at about the right level of complexity, you'll probably find Civ VI too complicated and unfocused. If you thought Civ V with DLC was too simple, Civ VI might be a good choice for you.I really wanted to like Civ VI. The graphics are gorgeous, and I think the interface is much cleaner and more beautiful than that of Civ V. Hex visability is a lot more obvious, and the cartographic style of the map (i.e. it looks like a literal paper map) is a really nice touch.That said, I have started, briefly played, and then abandoned at least three separate games, and I don't feel like I got a lot out of the hours I spent on those games. Civ VI introduces a raft of new mechanics, most blatantly a second tech tree (a ""culture"" tree), but also city districts, a number of new resources (including housing and city-state influence), per-city happiness (needlessly renamed to ""amenity""), a much more elaborate social policy system, and so on. Individually, none of these changes are ""bad"" as such. But there are many of them, and they all seem to pull the game in different directions.Expansionism has been curtailed in a somewhat indirect way. Tiles surrounding a city are more cumbersome to upgrade, especially in the early game, because of the need to continually replace your builders as they are expended. Thus, they either occupy slots in your build queue, or they consume an unreasonable amount of gold. Worse, settlers now reduce population by one when finished instead of halting city growth while under production. The combination of these things makes it a lot harder to spam settlers and build lots of cities early. I imagine this was an intentional balance change. But unfortunately, it makes the early game boring and tedious because I don't feel like I'm accomplishing enough.Cities are also more complicated to administer. Happiness (""amenity"") is now per-city instead of global, and each city has a housing limit (raised by various buildings and improvements). Districts and wonders occupy tiles outside the city, so you need to expend a bit of cognitive effort deciding where they should land... for every single district or wonder you build in every single city you control. Combined with the reduced expansionism, this makes it feel like I'm expected to manage fewer cities more intensively.The increased load on the build queue from builders affects city development, too. So you have to choose between developing your cities, developing your tiles, pumping out army units, and not going broke buying things outside the queue. And, of course, if you have fewer cities, then you can build fewer things at once. In short, you have to manage your build queue a lot more carefully than in Civ V, which is annoying and not much fun. No more ""Ooh, I want that thing. ."" In practice, this means wonders are a lot less practical to build because you can't fit them into your build queue.At the other end of the abstraction spectrum, the social policy trees from Civ V have been coalesced into a single culture tree, which was probably the right move. Unfortunately, they combined this good change with a substantially more complicated social policy system. Now, you unlock policies and systems of government (via the culture tree). You get to have one system of government active at any time. Each system gives you some fixed bonuses, and a few slots for policies. The difficulty with this is that it requires you to decide which policies you want to use (unlike Civ V, where the answer was ""all of them""), which again imposes a moderate amount of cognitive load on the player.Naturally, once policies are unlocked, they remain available in the ""pick your active policies"" screen forever. So the screen rapidly fills up with useless clutter that you never wanted and don't care about. The game does at least highlight the new ones with an icon, but the interface gets quite full even in the Classical era. I can't imagine how ugly it must be in the Modern era.City-states got more complicated, too. You now build up ""influence"" with them, which translates into ""envoys"", which (finally!) translate into fixed bonuses. No more ""give me X gold for Y influence"" silliness. Again, the old system sucked. But that doesn't mean the new system is necessarily better. You have to decide which city-states should get your envoys, which determines the bonuses you receive. You only have a limited number of envoys and have to pick your favorite bonuses. Sound familiar?You also get free envoys for completing ""quests,"" which are a combination of reasonable things like ""build a trade route with {city state}"" and various random activities which also give half-off discounts on specific items in the tech and culture trees. Individually, many of these make sense (e.g. founding a city on the coast halves the cost of sailing research). But collectively, they end up feeling more like a per-game tutorial, which is odd because the game already has a tutorial.All this micromanagement is probably fun for some people, but it isn't my cup of tea. I reluctantly have to give Civ VI a thumbs down for being too complicated in too many different areas of gameplay at once."
192,98.2,Not Recommended," October 2, 2017",7,"Almost a year after it’s release, let’s see how Sid Meier’s Civilization VI fares. Is it a great game? Is it a bad game? Is it a disappoi- DING! Correct! It’s a @#$%ing disappointment! …Let me see if I can explain why.This review was made possible with the help of Daegon Black. Thanks for the help.Note: This review does not include the features and/or changes that the Rise & Fall expansion will bring. That will be reviewed separately.The Good >> Culture:Civilization VI (or Civ VI for short) introduces a neat change to the policy gameplay, by adding its own research tree known as a Civic Tree.The Civic Tree, which uses culture, focuses on researching policies that helps your civilization in various ways as it has done in the previous games of the series. Of course, you can only have so much policies in effect for a period of time, but after researching certain civics in the Civic Tree, you will be able to use more policies.I really like this addition to the game. For one, this puts players on a different focus, in which they can’t just focus on science all the time, they now need to focus on culture. And two, when playing Civilization, I usually play a cultural style and to see the developers increase the uses for culture is a big plus in my book.The AI for the opposing civilizations in Civ VI is easily the most frustrating experience I’ve had to deal with to date. They’re very sensitive to the actions that you make, or don’t make, and they critique your army a lot in this game.When playing against AIs, you can view their agendas, which tells you what they like or dislike from their opponents. Problem is, the majority of them prefer seeing a strong military. In the case you don’t have a strong army, your enemies will let you know by contacting you, denouncing you and eventually, declaring war on you.One example of poor AI that I want to share. One game, I had a group of enemy units next to my borders. Eventually, war was declared, but instead of attacking my units, the enemy turned their units around back towards their city.Another new addition that Civ VI introduces is Districts. Districts focuses on the key elements of the game, science, culture, money, production, you name it. They are essential in advancing in the game. Problem here is that it cuts down the pace of the game.If you were to look at this game’s predecessor, Civ V, you could build any type of buildings & wonders at anytime in the game. In Civ VI, you need to have the specified district built if you want to build specific buildings, and wonders suffers more problems as well. Some of them needs a particular district and maybe another building before you can start constructing it.Another thing to note is that the first few Districts will take time to build. Adding insult to injury, the Industrial District, which specializes in production, is among the last districts you will research as it’s far from the start of the game.It saddens me to make the move of not recommending this game. I want to like this game and I want to recommend it to friends & various people, but considering the negative points that I made, which can’t be ignored that easily, this is a game you should avoid. There are much better 4x strategy games out there that won’t frustrate you like this one."

472,131.5,Not Recommended," December 21, 2016",7,"Maybe after Workshop support and an expansion or two, this could be a good Civ game. In the meantime, it isn't. In fact, it's quite likely that even several expansions will be unable to fix what I'm convinced is a fundemantally broken game.None of the various systems in the game interact together well or function as intended. Take religion - it's a miserably grindy secondary combat layer with only three units. It can be won in two ways: getting the right random promotions on your apostles, or by simply declaring war and exterminating religious units with regular combat units and ignoring it altogether. Religion always defaults to miltiary combat, which is always a function of production.Or how about culture - culture and tourism have no effect on any other system except for initial border growth. Once your borders hit another civilization's borders, all border pressure stops and there's no way to affect those borders except, again, by reverting to military combat (with the exception of Poland, a DLC civ). Winning a culture victory amounts to pressing end turn a whole bunch of times until your arbitrary tourism number is higher than your opponent's arbitrary tourist number. There is no way to affect your opponents tourism number except by wiping them off the map - even nukes will not make enemy tourism decrease. They will, however, prevent your opponent from converting any more production into culture, thereby shaving off a few extra 'end turn' presses. Again, the easiest way to win a culture victory is by resorting to brute force. Again a system inevitably boils down to miltiary strength and production.Wonders have lackluster bonuses, take an incredible amount of very valuable production to build, and take up precious district and improvment tiles while providing zero tile yields of their own and deleting existing yields. They are never worth building over things that help your production or miltary.Districts are there to ostensibly make your cities more customizable, but they do the opposite. Because produciton is everything, you will build the same districts in the same order in every city, every time. Industrial districts -> commerical districts -> science districts -> anything else. Worse, the buildings you build in each district amount to different versions of the same building. There is almost no customization to what you can build within districts, with the exception of the art/archeological museum choice in cultural districts. But you don't need to build those anyways.Because most of the systems in the game are superfluous, the science and civic trees are similarly warped in favor of production and miltiary tech. In the tech tree you will beeline for commercial and industrial districts and buldings every time. Then you will pick up the units you need to steamroll. In the civics, most of the policy cards are fairly useless - it's the government types that really make a meaningful difference. While there is some choice in government types in the early game, the civic tree ultimately resolves itself into a race to get communism, which has a 10% global production bonus in a game where almost every bonus is small, local, and additive. After you get communism, the civics tree has no more meaningful choices left.A scientific victory involves building a whole bunch of spaceship parts which means, spoiler alert, it's nothing but a production check. Beakers themselves come primarily from scientific districts, which take gears to build and upgrade. Production, production, production.Diplomacy is..., well there are already tons of great critiques of the atrocious diplomacy system. Needless to say, it barely functions at all except as a constant annoyance and can be safely ignored in favor of, you guessed it, production.Influence is the only system in the game that actually has no ties to production whatsoever, but that's because it's barely in the game at all. Influence gain is totally static, arbitrary, and divorced from any other system, and it can only be affected by a handful of government choices and policy cards. Needless to say, you will never be able to hang onto any of the few good city states (read: those with production bonuses) without taking the influence policy card every time. Good thing every government has at least one guaranteed diplomacy slot for the only diplomacy card that matters!So gears are it. Nearly every other system or mechanic reduces to 'do you have enough gears/units to solve the problem'. This means every game is winnable exactly the same way - mindless city, industrial district, domestic trade route and unit spam until there's nowhere left to expand to. Your civilization choice only affects how long it takes you to hit that critical mass of gear deployment.So then what about war? Is the combat finally a fun experience?You already know the answer. The tactical AI is actually worse than the AI in Civ V, and there's a very simple reason for it: movement in Civ VI is much slower than in Civ V, and movement points are a lot more valuable. What this means in practical terms is that the AI has a lot less room for tactical screw-ups than it did in Civ V, and it isn't capable of doing anything but screwing up tactically. With the new movement-points system, the AI can move right up to your ranged units, but still not have enough movement points left to attack. That's right, in this game your archer blob doesn't even really need a few melee units for cover. I've only lost a city to an AI one time, and that was on my very first game. I've been able to beat deity games every game thereafter, and I am a thourougly mediocre Civ V player who could only occasionally take on anything higher than emperor. Even if the AI bothered to upgrade its units correctly it would still be completely unable to pose a significant threat because it simply cannot plan ahead enough to deal with the limited movement points.So far I have only described fundemental flaws in the various systems and mechanics that Civ VI has to offer, I haven't gone into any depth on the horrendous bugs or micromanagement issues that turn every game into a repetitive mindless chore. I've ignored these things for two reasons: there are already tons of reviews that identify these problems in great detail, and also it's likely that these problems can be fixed by patches or mods.But every major system in the game is broken at a core level. It is highly unlikely that these problems can or will ever be fixed by any DLC or expansion pack. They require not just a few balancing tweaks or extra attention and time, a real fix would involve a ground up systems redesign on a game-wide level. In other words, in order for Civ VI to be a good game it would actually have to become an entirely different game.That isn't going to happen. Save your money, save your time for something other than systems-testing broken software, and for the love of god take Firaxis off your 'guaranteed preorder' shortlist. The glory days of Civilization are long over, and the new Firaxis has definitively proven itself incapable of crafting a satisfying or interesting long-term strategy experience."

690,94.3,Recommended," June 20, 2017",67,"I've been a devout fan of the Civilization series ever since I was introduced to Civilization 2 a couple of decades ago. While I obviously liked some aspects of each game more than others, the bottom line was always the same - I really loved all the main installments of the series ever since, and the spinoffs (Colonizations & Beyond Earth) a bit less, although my opinions of them were generally on the positive side as well.Not surprisingly, after playing over 60 hours, I feel pretty much the same way about Civilization 6. Sure, it has some problems. The AI, for one... ...well, I agree, it sucks. Also, beyond the tedious amount of time the game takes to load, even on decent machines (i7 Quad-Core, 16GB RAM and Geforce GTX465 here), it also tends to lag and stutter from time to time (after changing governments, for example). In some cases, the game wouldn't close on its own, forcing me to restart my system just to get rid of it.The thing is, despite all those problems, I'm still having way too much fun with this game to dismiss it and put it aside. Even with the crappy AI, the lags and the stutters, the game is fun to play. Just like the previous games in the series, Civilization 6 offers the same gameplay mechanics we're used to, with a new, interesting twist, to make the mix familiar and intuitive on one hand, but refreshing and interesting on the other.One of my favorite additions is the 'Eureka' / 'Inspiration' boosts to scientific and cultural advancements. All sorts of things can stir you in the right direction for finding something out. Founding a city on the coast, for example, gives you a boost for researching 'Sailing'. Killing enough barbarians and clearing one of their outposts gives you boosts for a couple of military related advancements, and so on. This adds another layer to the way you might want to play, as the more such boosts you get, the faster you advance in general, but since you obviously can't get all of them, you might choose to focus on a specific direction, or to change the order of the topics you research accordingly.Another interesting new concept is the districts within the cities. If in previous civilization games you just spammed buildings all over, now you have to plan ahead. Each district allows building certain types of buildings. A ""Holy Site"", for example, lets you build religious buildings, an ""Encampment"" lets you build military buildings and so on. While each city can have more than one district, the space is limited, so you have to choose - not only between districts, but also between districts and tile improvements, as each tile can support either an improvement or a district (or a world wonder, btw). Just like the science/culture boosts, this makes you think and plan carefully.My bottom line is this - if you liked the previous Civilization games, I bet you'd like this one as well."

As an avid Civilization player since Civ 3 this is what I've come to expect from Firaxis.Civilization VI has a HUGE learning curve coming from V but I can tell you with 100% certainty that this game was worth every penny and I have zero regrets in either my monetary investment or the hundreds of hours I've put into learning this wonderful game.Even after putting a MASSIVE amount of time into the game I'm still finding things that are cool/new be it new strategies or new aspects of the game which are crazy strong that before I considered weak or was completely unaware this is not at all something I was expecting since in Civ V there were only 2 main Strategies and one specific wonder made all players quit if they didn't get itI'm quite willing to poke the proverbial bear in the rump by saying that a large portion of the negative reviews are posted from players who do not wish to abandon their beloved V(or equivalent) and simply do not like the changes/time required to learn a completely new game from scratch (I still see people saying bull crap about ""Wide vs Tall, Unit Stacking etc etc"" It DOESN'T apply here it's NOT Civ V it's NOT Civ III THIS is Civ VI! SO STOP...PLEASE)When Civilization VI has been tweaked(just like Civilization V was after it was released... Yeah don't you remember how horrible that game was back then?) as I'm sure it will be over time I plan to continue investing time into it as long as the naysayers who just want Civ V with upgraded graphics do not get their way. I hope to see/hear that others others are experiencing all the unique gameplay that Civilization VI has to offer.For all Civilization V or its predecessors' diehards who actually want to experience a new game after having invested 5k+ hours into the previous version pull up your panties because this is one hell of a bumpy transition. It's unique in many aspects and the game is not a polished product (yet) so if you expect to be able to pull off the whole ""I'll build cities/districts without units"" gig then you're going to be sorely disappointed when Barbarians and civilizations like Scythia come knocking at your door.Don't feel bad if you're against the way the game is set up. People have hopped off the band wagon between every civ transition to stick to their favorite out of the series (it took a lot to peel me from 4 to test 5) but don't hate on an undeveloped game just because it's unfimilar or different to what we grew to love in Civ V (Heck, any of the previous versions). Uncompleted games are something that we've determined that this producer continuously releases so that it can be refined based off of reviews.Overall it's a bang for your buck but keep in mind that it's still in development. Just don't let archaic viewpoints molded from a different game keep you from enjoying this one like I let mine hold me back from experiencing how grand Civ V was (and still is)!(Edit) I must say though I haven't found a game quite as addictive as Civilization VI, in which I can come back to and play over and over and over since Age of Empires II Age of Kings without growing weary of the game and even then, never have I put such a vast amount of time into any game in such a short time."

Remember how broken civ 5 was at launch, the same thing is happening with civ 6. I have been seeing alot of bad reviews and i simply must say this. Of course it's not going to be like civ 5! Civ 5 has got 2 expansion packs, 3 dlc bundles and 19 DLC's. Of course it won't have the same amount of content. Now i will adress some of the problems i've had encountered.Problem 1: Civilizations declaring war and not sending troops (or sending only a small amount). This has happened 2 or 3 times to me, but that doesn't mean it's always going to be like that. Most of the time i see nations doing this, when i'm moving troops next to my borders.Problem 2: Warmongering. Even after 1500 years of not declaring war i'm still denounced by almost all nation's i've met, because at 500 B.C i destroyed germany and france. It's just so dumb and frustrating as you can't even trade with them, because if you want 1 luxury resource they'll want 50 gold per turn , because they don't like you.Problem 3: AI comlimenting you for no reason. Ok so this isn't a big problem, it's more of an issue, but i just find it strange. Norway hates me, because i have no navy, i build 1, i repeat, 1 ship and they compliment me. Aren't they supposed to have a big navy? I've encountered this '' issue"" alot.Problem 4 : Call for aid. So in my playtrough my delcared friend asked to join his war against Spain. I utterly destroy him and Capture his cities, everybody including my declared friend denounces me because i'm warmongering. It's just so dumb.And those are the major ( or at least what i think are major) problems.But it is still a fun game to play. If you don't want to spend 60 euro on this that's fine. And trust me when civ 7 comes out than its going to be the same.People saying buy civ 6 rather than civ 7, because it has alot more content, and civ 7 is broken."
268,220.7,Recommended," March 25, 2017",12,"A true strategy sequel that includes and builds on the strengths of the previous installment.Didn't plan to leave a review on this game, thought others already flooded this game with positive ones... I'm surprised.If you haven't played or know much about Civ V, then this review won't be much of a help.. most of the others won't be either.- There is Tourism and Religion in the basegame, which were monetized DLCs in case of Civ V.- The graphics changed. Some people make a big deal out of it, for me it depends on my mood... sometimes I prefer Civ V, sometimes Civ 6 (I recently played both games, and probably will as well).- The AI is questionable for sure (just like in Civ V), but it's not impossible at all to find challenge in defeating it. Just because it doesn't act the way you'd want it, or even logically, that doesn't mean it isn't serving its purpose.Regardless of what some other reviews imply, Civ V, Endless Legend, Endless Space and any similar game's AI can be really annoying, or can be abused hard. Humanity still sucks at creating AIs, deal with it.- The card system for Policies is actually pretty awesome, although it can be intimidating at first. You have to commit for a few turns, but it still remains flexible throughout the game.If you know what you want to do in the next 10-15 turns, the icons make is easy on you to find which card you need.- The new Culture-tree is also a nice addition...- ...especially with the Inspiration and Eureka moments which intertwine with every aspect of the game.There have been serious changes made regarding how you build your empire, I'll probably get a bit technical here:- The district system spices up the gameplay, city planning is more important than ever, which can be frustrating for new players and for everyone without experience.- Add to that the new Builders which I consider a huge negative. During development we were told that Workers would be changed in a way that they won't require extensive planning on how improvements should be built, which was a nice idea. Except with the new Builders you basically have to plan for the whole game, since they're expended when used. This also forces you to plan ahead (or risk wasting resources).- Certain Districts, Buildings and Wonders have serious pre-requisites (more so than Machu Pichu or Neuschwanstein), which guess what: forces you to plan ahead.Overall as good as those mechanics are in the last 3 points, combined they make it really hard for unexperienced players to play to the max, or even just try certain things. However they work really well if you know how and when to do what. These things go from very frustrating to awesome when you start paying attention.Additional thoughts:Extremely unlucky for Firaxis that their old game is still competing with their newest release. Look at it this way: they can't NOT develop a Civ game for 10-15 years, but it's also really difficult to make a clearly better game than Civ V.And it's impossible to meet every player's expecations.For Civ V lots of people paid 100€ or more, while they obviously can't charge that much for Civ 6 on release, yet players expect the same depth and possiblities... which the devs actually delivered. They implemented new mechanics, kept the old and good ones (from Civ V AND its 2 extensive DLCs) and made a game that might look very similar, but offers a quite different experience. That's the best they could do on a basegame release, and MUCH better than most other copmanies would do.It's yet to be seen whether we get TRUE DLCs, that aren't just new civs. No verdict on Digital Deluxe yet.Even without knowing those I recommend the base game."

The AI will settle RIGHT NEXT TO your cities and then demand you move your troops. The AI completely skewers resource values and makes absurd demands for even relatively trivial resources, yet will not pay you more than peanuts (a few gold and open borders usually) for extremely valuable resources rendering trading essentially nonexistant. Tall playstyles have been gutted thanks to many poor design choices like wonders and districts taking up tiles. The tech tree actually allows you to do things like make Infantry before Musketmen. Half of my starts are completely unplayable, either by getting overrun by 3-4 barbarian encampments right around my start or by desperately lacking vital resources- and this is with balanced starts enabled.

226,224.3,Recommended," November 7, 2016",79,"Product received for freeA couple facts: Im old, been gaming since 82. I've been a writer, a coder, a tester but above all else a gamer. My favorite type of game is strategy and i've spent many thousands of hours playing every sid meier game that has ever came out. From pirates, railroads, sim city and every civ. I got a copy of this game for free, which was neat because I was about to order it but I have been on a mailing list since like 92 and I guess it was my turn. First time heh.What I liked:Game felt very familiar right away. I didn't struggle to understand anything that was going on. The districts are explained very well and actually make sense. I never did like being able to cram every single wonder into one city in previous civs, i mean it made for a great city but really, where were you putting all those things? Depending on which civ you choose you can have anywhere from 5 to 6 districts per city from a selection of arts, entertainment, industry, science, faith etc etc. Each of those districts can house many different types of buildings specific to your civ and what direction you are trying to go in with that city. Also Wonders are linked to districts and by land formations you can't just build them anywhere so city placement, tile purchase and city layout are very strategic.Diplomacy. I read alot of negative comments about this. How the AI is insane and makes no sense. In fact i'd say 75% of the negative reviews are about this. However, I can say that 100% of the people complaining about the diplomacy simply don't understand it. Civ VI diplomacy is insanely complex and deep, every leader has his/her own personality matrix plus 2 agendas, one public and one hidden. The public agenda is always the same, lets call it the civ agenda. The hidden agenda is more like the leaders personal goal, looking out for him/herself not so much their nations interest. You have to get close to a nation through gifts, trading, etc to be granted 'secret' access to their policy to see their hidden agenda. If anything you do goes counter to any of their agenda's they become erratic and paranoid. Think south korea and north korea, they co-exist but barely. Or china and taiwan. Civs take their sovereignty super serious in this one, even the HINT that you are making an aggressive move makes them paranoid, build a settler, fine, move that settler one hex towards empty land near them, they freak. Remember, they are hipocrits too. Oh and gifts are your friend, give them small amounts of gold every so often.Units and Combat.The combat in this version is about the same as in the last, you do have some support units and there is a whole faith based combat system but honestly most of the refinement can be had here, its not great but its not bad.Fit and PolishI do wish they had gone a different direction than the cartoony graphics, of course one of the first mods i used was the westeros reshade filter which helped a ton, another issue is when playing a 12 AI map turns take forever to resolve, sometimes 2 minutes which is crazy.

56,255.3,Not Recommended, March 8,22,"I have played Civ games obsessively since the first one, loading up slowly from a floppy disc on my Amiga. I confess I tend to not like each new version that comes out, then gradually warm to it (partly because it takes a while for them to fix the games and add in the features and scenarios to make them a good experience). However, this time it's different. I just can't play this game. I repeatedly pick it up again and ""have another go"" but it always breaks me for one simple reason. Too. Crowded. What attracted me to Civ in the first place was the sense of wonder as you explore, note potential city sites, assay the land around you, decide where things are going to go. But in Civ6 that is completely absent. The locations where I want to put my 2nd, 3rd and 4th cities will be occupied by two other Capital Cities and a City State. If I was a wargamer, maybe I'd like that. If I was exploring in order to identify which sucker to smack up first, it would thrill me. But I am an empire-BUILDER not an empire-TAKER. Not once has Civ 6 let me actually build a civilization. So for me, for now at least, it's Civ 4 and Civ 5."

Went with Gilgamesh and having a blast!Easily the best Civ game at release to date!

I have had none of the balancing issues with diplomacy, denouncing etc that everyone else is complainging about. Yes Civs can do dumb things at times....this is a franchise issue not a civ 6 issue.

Sounds legit)-Maps are limited to smaller and less players than Civ V-City-states are more random chance and luck than previous.

19,173.1,Not Recommended, January 16,5,"I've been playing these games since the first one came out on Atari ST. I think the series peaked at IV, V was OK, they managed to make the 1-unit-per-tile think work, but this is a definite regression. Cumbersome and crude. Everything is too expensive and awkward to do. Religion doesn't seem to get you anywhere. You can't meaningfully build roads any more which means transporting your units around becomes awkward. At about 6 or 7 population, your cities start hitting ""need more amenities/need more housing/need more food, and it's not clear how to get those. Either or the former can only come from certain buildings which you can only build in certain ""districts"" of which you can only build a certain number.As to food, the problem there is that workers can only be used to improve three tiles. Yes three. And they cost a fair amount to build.Going to war is cumbersome, diplomacy is cumbersome. I haven't played a full game of this yes, I haven't got beyond the medaeival era in fact; started maybe five, but got bored of each one and tweaked and restarted because the whole cumbersome shenanigans caused me to lose interest.This was my all-time favourite game series, but this version, I will probably never play a game all the way through.

There still isn't a competently balanced difficulty setup, every civilization runs the same strategy, with very little regard for leader identity. Leader identity should be a core focus, but it's just ignored. Civ 6 promised a new Casus Belli system, which has turned out to be just new ways to be declared a war mongerer by everyone else. You can now be invited into a joint war and then declared a war mongerer by the civilization that asked you to join the joint war. The company in-charge has no public-face, which means they don't value their gamers. I wonder where the creativity went in game design."

This, compared to hundreds of hours I've played on Civ 4 and 5.Key takeaways:- The game is painfully slow-paced and filled with pointless details. It takes forever in real life, and decades in-game, to move across a continent or build improvements. And this is with unit animations turned off.- The civic and tech trees are really bloated, and all the additonal technologies only serve to constantly annoy you every few turns with pop-ups.- The clever quotes for technologies and civics get really old, really fast."
371,44.8,Recommended," October 21, 2016",5,"From the one game I have played till the end this is where I stand:If you enjoyed Civ V you will enjoy Civ VI no questions asked.Early game is a lot more enganing, just a quick word of warning, early game is a lot more focused on warring and conquering, in my game by about turn 40-50 my neighbour decided to come at me with about 10 chariots.I defended against these chariots with about 3 archers and 2 spearmen, quick hint, don't kill the AI's units just damage them to the point they retreat and then chase them down, the AI won't attack your city if the unit attacking will die.Mid Game is a lot more about specalising and making sure all your shiny new districts are setup. With the new culture system there is a lot more ways to play the game. As long as you are not reaching for a optimum stradgey that will win every game then there is tons of replayability in this.Late game has a lot less wars and in my game the AI wouldn't stop denouncing me, from what I saw there is 5-6 different victory conditions that can be met and the victory I went for (Science) has a animated victory screen. One thing I didn't like though when compared to Civ V is the lack of a map through history view or whatever it was called or atleast I didn't spot it.In the end it is a great game and deffiently worth playing should you be able to afford the hefty price tag."

19,173.1,Not Recommended, January 16,5,"I've been playing these games since the first one came out on Atari ST. I think the series peaked at IV, V was OK, they managed to make the 1-unit-per-tile think work, but this is a definite regression. Cumbersome and crude. Everything is too expensive and awkward to do. Religion doesn't seem to get you anywhere. You can't meaningfully build roads any more which means transporting your units around becomes awkward. At about 6 or 7 population, your cities start hitting ""need more amenities/need more housing/need more food, and it's not clear how to get those. Either or the former can only come from certain buildings which you can only build in certain ""districts"" of which you can only build a certain number.As to food, the problem there is that workers can only be used to improve three tiles. Yes three. And they cost a fair amount to build.Going to war is cumbersome, diplomacy is cumbersome. I haven't played a full game of this yes, I haven't got beyond the medaeival era in fact; started maybe five, but got bored of each one and tweaked and restarted because the whole cumbersome shenanigans caused me to lose interest.This was my all-time favourite game series, but this version, I will probably never play a game all the way through. I'm very unlikely to buy any of the expansions for this one, and probably 50/50 as to whether I'll buy VII if they ever bother with it."
23,58.3,Not Recommended," November 15, 2016",5,"I've played Civ off and on since its inception, way back when 386 processors existed. The game has not evolved depth, it merely shuffles pieces around old coding. There still isn't a competently balanced difficulty setup, every civilization runs the same strategy, with very little regard for leader identity. Leader identity should be a core focus, but it's just ignored. Civ 6 promised a new Casus Belli system, which has turned out to be just new ways to be declared a war mongerer by everyone else. You can now be invited into a joint war and then declared a war mongerer by the civilization that asked you to join the joint war. The company in-charge has no public-face, which means they don't value their gamers. I wonder where the creativity went in game design."
33,97.4,Not Recommended," December 29, 2017",5,After over a year still buggy. Better but buggy. AI plain stupid. Diplomacy still inexplicable: a civ can easily denounce you literally 1 turn after declaring friendship. Creating a game is VERY slow -- going for small you can grab a drink; staring huge you can go cook family dinner. Restarting takes SAME time as starting new and my favorite you can start LITERALLY next to another civ. tile to tile. screenshot of that . They really didn't know how to prevent that

This, compared to hundreds of hours I've played on Civ 4 and 5.Key takeaways:- The game is painfully slow-paced and filled with pointless details. It takes forever in real life, and decades in-game, to move across a continent or build improvements. And this is with unit animations turned off.- The civic and tech trees are really bloated, and all the additonal technologies only serve to constantly annoy you every few turns with pop-ups.- The clever quotes for technologies and civics get really old, really fast."

I have played 68.3 hrs on this game and I really wanted to love this game, but why would I buy a newer game when the older version civ 5 is just so much better? Like the idea of expanded cities. If you take one thing from this game and put it in your next attempt at a better sequel take that developers. So all things taken into the account after 4+ times of playing this game each time with a different Civ I can say that this game is not an improvement."
132,263.1,Not Recommended," October 26, 2016",5,"Product received for freeThe Sid Meiers Civilization game that was promised to be ""complete"" at launch. It was supposed to be a finished and polished product. It isn't.It's not far off, but I find myself, even with the ""new to civ"" option on, lost as how to use the new features or units in the game. The Civilopedia is woefully inadequate. It gives you a moderate description of the real world units, buildings, concepts, etc., but the in-game function is described minimally.Diplomacy is still lacking and the A.I. is clearly still quite basic.The Complete Civilization IV is still the best version of the game. Hopefully as with almost every Civ game in the franchise they will improve this most basic of Civ games. I hope they don't wait to do it in an expansion but rather in a comprehensive patch."

""Is the UI really this bad, or did I completely forget how to computer?"" ""I wonder what's on TV?""Unresponsive user interface aside, stilted game mechanics aside, overpowered combined units aside, Cleopatra as a Latina chica aside, this game is BORING. I'm not sure how the developers managed to go from the previous deeply engaging game to this disappointing garbage. So much of what you do seems to have little or no consequence. Religion in particular seems to be little more than a distraction; it's easy to go through the game while paying zero attention to it. The endgame is particularly annoying, with no option to just set a city to produce gold or whatever and ignore it. Spies likewise require frequent babysitting.If you're a fan of the Civ series, wait till the next one comes out."

211,51.6,Not Recommended," November 13, 2016",5,"It really saddens me to give this game a thumbs down. Civ has been my favourite game since Civ 1, and I was really looking forward to this instalment. Unfortunately it was real let down. My only hope is that they patch it. As I recall, vanilla Civ 5 was not all that great.One quick disclaimer about my review - I am going to be explaining things as I experienced them. I have purposefully not read all the details of all the mechanics of Civ 5 (I of course read about the basic differences). With all versions, I like to learn the basics and play by feel for a while - just to extend that feeling of actually building an empire rather than playing a computer game.The good:1. I love what they did with the governments and civics. It feels like a combination of the early Civs (where you had actual governments) with the civics of Civ 5 plus so much more. I was really impressed here, and it really adds a dynamic element that you can continuously change between different kinds of civics in anticipation of what you will be doing in the next few turns.2. The districts - this appears under both pros and cons. Overall, the idea is great and I like it. It adds a tile management strategy to the game.3. The wonders - as above, this appears under both headings. I like the tile management aspect.4. They seemed to have removed penalties for larger kingdoms (as in Civ 5). I can only approve.5. They went back to the traditional city-based happiness model. This is real Civ.The bad:1. The AI and the warmongering penalties. I dont know what to say here. The AI is beyond abysmal. It routinely wages war and me and then sends no units. Like NONE. It is upset with me constantly and everyone is denouncing me for the most idiotic reasons. And because they are always mad at you for no good reason, you can rarely make a decent deal with them either. A few examples of AI/programming stupidity:i) I found a religion. Next turn I denounced by Kongo for not having spread it to them. The next turn. I barely knew where the hell Kongo was on the map exactly.ii) I build one wonder and am denounced by China for having more wonders than they do. That remained permanent because, despite their builder bonus, they cant build♥♥♥♥♥♥iii) America declares war on me in the ancient era, sends no troops (not ONE) but refuses any kind of peace arrangement until the Renaissance. They were on the other end of the map. Logical.iv) I build a peaceful kingdom and am attacked constantly (or more correctly, war is declared constantly). The AI declares war on me in groups - ok I understand that, but they send almost no units. The biggest culprit is Brazil, my neighbour. After centuries and centuries of fending off my borders and otherwise being a sweetheart, I have enough of Brazil and I declare war. EVERYONE denounces me as a warmonger, including America (see above). That was my ""♥♥♥♥ it"" moment when I decided to screw international relations altogether and just beat them the old fashioned way.2) Increasing district costs. I am not sure of the formula, but they increase in cost throughout the game. Very annoying because it makes later cities difficult to improve.3) Lack of worker automation - I get why this had to be removed with the new tile management system and the fact that worker ""charges"" are extremely valuable. However, operating a large kingdom is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥particularly when dealing with the new small graphics (see below).4) Wonder restriction. It is frustrating that they added so many restrictions to wonders. I understand what they were thinking, and they were aiming at an added strategic element, but it makes it way too luck based. And they are ridiculously specific, not just desert for the pyramids (which is annoying enough), but like ""must be on a hill next to a mountain"", ""must be on xxx next to xx district"".The matters of taste:1. The movement: Movement is rounded down, so you cant use the last movement point to cross a river, enter a forest, etc. This is ok, it was similar in the early Civs, but I don’t like that you also cant attack a unit in these squares with your last movement point. Makes for chasing barbarians around in circles. I also think roads do not offer enough of a bonus. Clearly the programmers never tried hiking over rough terrain.2. Graphics. Some people love them, some people hate them. I mostly dislike them. I don’t like the cartoon elements, but more than that I find it hard to get an overview of this map. I literally get tired.Conclusion:I am sure I missed a few things, but overall, this game stirs up no passion. It feels tedious and annoying, largely due to the AI but also due to other obstacles the game throws your way. The other Civ games I would play late into the night and I could hardly put them down. Remember that whole, ""just one more turn"" thing? That's what I have to tell myself now just to convince myself to take another turn of this thing."
184,192.4,Not Recommended," January 3, 2017",5,"As someone that has over 1,000 hours in Civ V, I feel that I should write a review about this game after playing it for over 60 hours already. This game is fun and has a lot to offer that is new entirely to the Civilization games, at least recently, and also has new ways of playing the game which I will get back to in a moment. It also has a lot of question and sometimes bad game design and functionalities. So I will list out a list of specific accomplishments and faults of the game right now.-Promotion system is awesome!Pros:-Districts are awesome. They provide replayability to all of the civilizations as you can play through each of them a multitude of different ways-Religion is now a way of achieveing victory. This is a great addition becuase it give a purpose to the religion system seen in Civ V. (There is a con to this however that I will address later).-The civics tree is amazing. This adds so much flexablilty to each civ, it also adds replayablilty as you can play as communist America or facist India. It offers so much more to the game.-This is subjective, but the art style in my opinon is superior to Civ V in the sense that it is unique and allows for more individualized detail for each civ. The attention to detail is much more substantial compared to Civ V.-Armys and Corps are an awesome additon and makes war even more enjoyable than before with the addition of some cool animations as well.-The fact that every playthrough will not be the same as you wil not be able to build the same wonders over and over again. This goes in line with strtegicaly placeing everything around your cities.Cons:-Lack of content (which I know will be reversed in the past, but it is barebones at realse).-Barbarians give and take from the experience. I am always tempted to turn them off, but in the beginning they make the game exciting and they help with civics and technological advances. They are raging to the max and later on they give up on any logical strategical advantages and charge with their spears at your tanks. This needs to be fixed.-Civs in this game are all warmongers. In Civ V you could play the game without going to war. In this game, it is almost impossible to do so with each civ being programed to attack one another, not caring about the penalties, and their agendas are contradictory completely. The Kongo hated me becuase I woud not spread my religion to them even though they had their own, that makes no sense. This is probably the number one thing that MUST be addressed before this game can be worth the $60 asking price.-War is too heavily emphasised in this game as I stated before. Every victory is reliant on it.-There are next to no luxury resources in this game. What happened to jewlery?-City states are broken and will leave being your ally for no reason whatsoever. Even if their are no spies in the game and you have 13 envys sent to them, they will still leave. They act like bi-polar prepubecent girls that just had their first period. But, because this game relys on war, might as well take them all over.-The science victory is egregious. If you do not have sufficent production to build anything, even with the space civics, you will not win a science victory unless you have another way of getting some great engineers. It is awful how long it take to win this way.-Hitler is not the leader of Germany-Poland was added to the game before Mongolia (Why?)-Aztecs are locked-There is no diplomacy victory. This is huge and might be the reason as to why the diplomacy is nonexsistant in this game. This needs to be added ASAP as it will add an actual passive way of achieveing victory.-Nuclear weapons have no real apperence in this game compared to Civ V as it is substantally harder to aquire uranium than before.-Trading is garbage in this game as Civs will ask for the dumbest trade deals I have ever witnessed.Is this game worth the money though? It seems with everything this game achieved, it failed in an aspect of it. It is fun and there is a lot of game play to get through and it is fustrateing enjoyable. With that in mind. It is not worth how much it is. Civ V with the DLC is cheaper and is superior to this game in many aspects, most of which were in vinila Civ V. I would not buy this right now and would wait for a good sale of atleast 50% off its current price. Nuclear Gandhi would have wanted it that way."
61,796.1,Not Recommended," December 2, 2016",5,This game is only worth getting if you plan to play singleplayer or online multiplayer with friends. If you plan to play this for its public multiplayer dont online game speed combined with simultaneous turns is pure cancer. GOOD LUCK getting a multiplayer game that has its settings on quick or dynamic turns. I already wrote a pretty long review why online game speed and simultaneous turns is just pure cancer individually and togther especially but it didnt upload properly so to sum it up real quick. Simultaneous turns same old problem whoever clicks first wins removing all strategy from the game. Online speed allows even low production cities to build units in ludicrously quick amounts of time even allowing for units to be completed in a single turn for much of the game this helps to further kill any hope of tactics and strategy that you might wish to employ on your own. As basically online multiplayer is just a spam click fest were people just spam units and click till their mouse explodes in order to win.

327,50.8,Not Recommended," April 30, 2017",5,"Nah, I don't like it.The biggest reason I don't like this game is the GUI, menu system and interface in general just feel aweful. Scrolling to the side of the screen is awkward, auto select is weird, auto explore is hidden behind a ""sub"" command menu, with two extra options. There's a delay when it auto selects the next unit, you find yourself dragging combat units to the other end of the map by mistake.The videos for the civs are not seemless, like in Civ V. They cut after they speak, and move to the options after. You can't just click ""OK"" in the middle of the speech you've heard 5 times. You have to wait for the video to end.This game just isn't as polished as Civ V, it's missing that extra touch. It does not feel like a blockbuster AAA Civ series, it feels more like a ""in the spirit of"" game, designed by a small indie studio, using the same engine.I'd probably play this game if they completely redid the entire interface, GUI and menu system to be honest. It isn't a terrible game.I also find the science + the civics being researched at the same time a bit unneccesary. After the first 50 turns or so, I just found myself picking whatever and clicking OK. It didn't seem to really matter anymore."

It's not particularly challenging, it's slow, and the rewards underwhelming. I've only spent 33 hrs on the game - half of that with several community mods that actually do significantly improve the game - but I just can't muster the enthusiasm to play more.However, I also felt really disappointed by Civ V, too.

This is quite a departure from previous versions and not entirely clear on what does what and what effects things have. Cant get into the game and the DLC... good ness me is it over priced!
71,25.1,Not Recommended," September 3, 2017",5,"Civ 6 while being a decent game, is lacking in comparison to other civ titles. The total content of Civ 6 right now is nowhere near Civ 5 while being much more expensive. The minor technical changes in the game aren't worth the price. Overall, Civ 6 introduces some interesting mechanics that provide minor game changes, but with a lack of content and steep price in comparison to other civ games forces me to recommend not wasting your money on this game and instead buying Civ 5 with all the dlc unless you want to complete your civ collection.Some may argue that I shouldn't compare Civ 6 to Civ 5 because one is a completed game and the other still has content being released, however being that one is currently much cheaper with all of it's content delivered and the other is much more expensive, with less content, and that any additional content will require more high prices."

The graphics and animations are beautiful. It really feels like the majority of the buget went to the art and animation department. Everything in the game is crisp it, it flows super well and is a huge improvement over Civ5.AI:Lets get the elephant in the room out of the way here. The AI is the worst I've seen since early gen FPS. The first 100 turns it feels like your could actually lose to them but after that they disappear (not really). The trades they offer are absoultely insane. I got offered 1 gold for 5 Lux resources, it kind of floored me. Peace trades are also pretty insane. I think the best I got offered was for my peace (I was doing a dom vic) was peace + 5gold a turn. Another thing I don't see much about on these reviews is the constant assualt of taunts and getting spammed by the AI. Holy mother of god is it bad. If playing with 6 AI you will get 40 AI taunts per turn. Not really but it feels that bad The worst is you can only turn off the animations and not the pointless taunts themselves. It takes a lot out of the game having to spam the esc key after your turn just to make it out of the spam phase. The AI's military tactics are laughable at best. They send units 1 by 1 to get picked off by whatever you have. After you get walls the chance of losing a city is pretty much none. The barbarians are stronger and play better then the player AI's.GAMEPLAY:Now the real heart of the game is the gameplay. It has the same but different vibe going for it. The resources such as food, production, and gold work the same way. The luxury items now count for amenities. Which is like happiness but each city has it own seperate want . The builders count as work boats now and instead of lasting forever they get a couple of builds then poof like a great person. Now tile improvements if where the game feels bare. Most of the improvements form Civ5 come way later into the game around 200ish turns, such as lumber camps and mines; unless you tech for those. Majority of tile imrpovements come from district which act as main hubs for building. Before you would have a forge, workshop, factory etc. Now you have a industry district which takes up a tile and you then have to research the buildings for it. This makes the game feel slower than normal as you can get all the districts pretty quickly but to get the sub buildings, that takes a while. Citys now have housing and amenities. I have never had a problem with housing and once you get a entertainment district its pretty much gg on amenities. So the housing is a waste of development time and adds nothing to the game. The have neighborhoods which is 2-6 housing and once u get that you really never have to worry about over population.Trades and spies get a short seperate piece since they work and I like them but there is something that is never said about them. THEY SPAM THE LIVING ♥♥♥♥ OUT OF THE SCREEN WITH CONSTANT PLAYER UPDATE INFORMATION. I wish I had a screenshot of this but is so bad. Sometime is takes up a good 80% of your screen and its junk info. China build a road. Brazil made a trade route with its own city. Just a bunch of stupid crap and it really, really needs to go. I would Google img search this to get a good idea infact I saw a reddit post.I can go into a lot more about how early game is basically spam units the protect form the massive barb onslaught or how civs from across the map will literally make a city on your lap, but thats the fun you get to figure out if you buy this steamer. I hope expansions make it better but at the same time they sold a 60doller sell game. I bought this from GMG for 46% off and I would still not reccoment it for anything under 70%.

I can't pinpoint what it is, but the graphics to me seem too ""childish"" or ""candy"", I liked the previous versions much more. Also the AI is a bit weak and dumb, declaring continuous wars that they have been declaring for the past 1000 years and loosing their territory in progress.

The AI opponents do not strategize interestingly nor are there multiple strong strategic warfare options for the player. Manually moving around units without the ability to construct permanent roads is dull and breaks immersion, Most of my game time felt like clicking and waiting. War is also unavoidable first with agressive early barbarians and then with the frequent inevitable surprise wars that every friendly AI declared. For example, the Vikings denounced my completely landlocked civ for lacking a strong navy, then attacked!The map art design makes it hard to see information at a glance such as where resources are located and oddly the areas already explored but out of view look almost like the fog of war, and many quality of life features from earlier versions of the Civ series are simply missing.Now that I have played Civ VI, I realize that I prefer earlier Civilization series games' more immersive simulation, strategic open-endedness and role-playing aspects. The earlier Civ series games Civ 4 and Civ 5, as well as Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri, and the Civ 4 Fall from Heaven 2 mod, offer a much wider range of interesting decisions. Their one more turn addictive charm came from both superb game mechanics and an immersive world in which to play out decisions.Civ VI's focus is board game-like mechanics that focus overwhelmingly on competitive war among players as a path to victory.

18,22.5,Not Recommended," October 4, 2017",5,"The core concept of Civilization VI is strong, but the execution is weak. I love the idea of creating civilizations and interacting with leaders of another country, but the leaders lack personality and the static images come off as boring. 12 hours in and the dialogue options are stale. If you don't comply with everything they say they will just plain not like you. With the exception of Ghandi, Cleopatra, Montezuma, and a few others, I have no clue who the others are and I don't get a sense of excitement when I discover them in the world.However, my main gripe with this game is that it's boring. The point is to advance from era to era, but it doesn't feel like you are advancing in this game. The pacing is way too slow and the payoff is thin. I also wish there was less clutter and more clarity in the menus. Being my first entry in the series, the tutorial wasn't great either.Although it sounds I hate Civilization VI, there is a charm to it. It has the potential to be fun and great, but currently the game is just boring. Most people recommended Civilization V, and seeing the reviews and the gameplay, there's more life and love put in that game.I've yet to try playing online, but if, like me, you were planning to play with the A.I.

The graphics are way too cartoony. I had to force mysef to play through. I thought I just wasn't maybe 'getting it'.But after one complete playthrough, I found that this game is a complete anthithesis of itas predecessor.Possibly the only positive change from 5 to 6 may be districts.

It introduces a nice level of complexity that I felt Civilization 5 was missing, and there are many conceptual improvements. The empire-wide happiness mechanic is gone, which means that settling more than 4 cities is once again a staple.At the same time, this game was released unfinished. It's clear that it will need many more months of development, maybe even years, to reach the level of polish that Civilization 5 currently has. That's a shame too, they should not have sold the game as a finished product knowing its problems, but here we are. The short of it is, if you aren't a dedicated Civilization player or a fan of the series, go pick up Civilization 5 instead. It's cheaper, has more content, and is decently balanced. This game is not.The DLC for this game is also pretty underwhelming. Adding additional Civs to play as is nice, charging $5 each is not."

I quit my most recent game since Japan refused to make peace unless I gave them a city (despite the fact that I destroyed their entire military) and then my citizens became unhappy because of the new war exhaustion system, which led to half of my empire revolting with nearly unkillable cavalry units pillaging all of my tiles. This game has so much going for it with the district system, interesting new unique civ abilities and units, and it's really great art style. The absolutely horrendous AI makes this game nearly unplayable in my opinion unless you play with friends, (I assume) which I haven't been able to do since none of them have bought this game.

109,98.2,Not Recommended," October 20, 2016",5,"After playing the game for less than 6 hours, I'm already starting to see a few flaws that they REALLY need to polish out.Major Problems : Map GenerationOne major flaw that I've noticed is something that was a problem during the previous civilization games. That flaw is the lack of resources you can get at the start (Or within this game, the lack of unique tiles or specific tile types) will result in you having less than someone else because you wasn't given it. You're rewarding players because of randomness. I feel like Civ 5 did a decent job on balancing it out, but it may become a huge problem during some playthroughs of this.You could say that ''Well you're meant to focus your city depending on what you're given''. But the problem is to advance in any form of focus, you need science to research additional culture, faith or production based buildings. Esentially, because of you not being given mountain or jungle tiles at the beginning of the game, you can fall behind VERY quickly because you can't research the production buildings to make up for what you wasn't given but everyone else was.This doesn't seem as much of a problem late game if you learn what are the best landscapes for the additional bonuses you need. But again, those practical areas might be taken by someone else, leaving you with nothing but trash.My second flaw that I've noticed is the unfair reward and climax of creating war. The AI they have recently implimented to this game is a LOT better than previous iterations from what I've currently experianced. The AI actually knows what its doing.However, the only reason it knows what its doing is because its so easy to suddenly attack or defend from the opponent. I could make troops for 50 turns and gain a huge army, but because its so easy and quick to product units, it makes it waaay too easy to actually defend your city if it gets attacked. In multiple cases I've attacked the AI or the AI attacked me and we would just focus on defending by pumping out units and quickly out produce the speed the opponents attack. So there is no reward for keeping track of other civilization's armies and comparing it your own in order to defend yourself IF you actually get attacked.During previous games it would take between 2-6 turns to build a unit, so it was a lot harder to defend, but a lot more rewarding to attack or defend if you prepared beforehand. Now I can produce units in 1-3 turns that are equally as powerful as the ones attacking my city. I could not produce an army for the entire game and if someone attacks me with a huge army out of nowhere, its very easy to produce the same army in a small amount of time to defend. It makes wars worthless.And most of the time, you don't have an equal production tile spawn to someone else. So on turn one if someone else was to produce units and just smash everyone else quickly before they can build tiles required to defend, you have nothing to stop them from taking you out quickly and no production to do anything about it because you require technology in order to get the additional production you didn't have to start with. But you can't get the science because you wasn't given a bunch of mountains and a bunch of jungle THAT THE PERSON ATTACKING YOU WAS RANDOMLY GIVEN.Everything boils down to spawning with tiles that give you additonal science. Regardless of if you plan your cities really well or not, you can't just move your first settler away to find a bunch of mountain tiles because it takes 2-10 turns to find suitable land. Which again, makes you fall back in science and the production you didn't have to start with.A new cool feature is the way how technology can now be boosted depending on you doing things at the beginning of the game through out to make you save half of you time researching. But my complaint with this is that sometimes the boosted research depends on farming a resource. A resource you might not be randomly given at the beginning of the game which others might.It's a nice feature because it allows you to actually produce units and do certain events in order to get ahead. It's a neat way of micro management. But it needs to be adjusted a tad to not be so dependant on you spawning with something early game and delay those for later game when you start making multiple cities.I love the new policy system and the new govenment system. The government system is a new way to create the policy trees without some trees being completely useless. Instead you pick and choose what government you want and that allows you to pick diffrent amounts of the diffrent types of policies. Depending on what you want to do will depend on which ones you pick. Amazing.The policy system works in a similar manor as the research system but doesn't depend as much on what is randomly given to you. It's pretty neat. If you focus on culture, you can work your way to things that you wasn't given at the start of the game such as additonal science from the great libary earlier than anyone else. This is the CORRECT way to counter the problems I mentioned previously, and this system actually improves you culture a lot more instead of culture being dependant on science completely like in previous civilization games.The world generation is pretty good at giving you recources and stuff. However, resources aren't that important anymore due to the new districts. Most of the time it comes to the point you have to build the districts on some of the recources because they give you more of a boost than they otherwise would have anywhere else.Now before you say ""But you said that the world generation is unfair as it gives stuff to certain people and not everyone else"". That's not what I said. The world generation is good. But the way how you get a bonus for having the lucky roll of a die and then you get rewarded for that good roll isn't an efficent way how to make a fair strategic game. It makes players too dependant on randomization instead of skill which is what this kind of game isn't about.Knowing and understanding the best places to put things in your city is a great addition. But it needs balancing simply due to the fact that some people get terrain that give you easy bonuses and some terrains don't.The game itself looks amazing, I love all the details they did along with the new art style and direction they're trying. But for the love of god make it less dependant on how good your randomly generated start is.The day or night cycle is an additional graphical feature that doesn't add anymore to the gameplay, but it makes the game feel more dynamic and actually help you in feeling that you're controlling an empire.I love the new worker system. It doesn't take 1000 years to build on tiles anymore.I adore the looks of the user interface. It makes the game a unique tone of being modern and sleek but still makes it feel welcoming for players.A small complaint I have (which might just be a bug) is that you have to turn on the recource icons every time you start up the game because it resets every time you play it. I don't understand why this wouldn't be on by default, but I guess people who were play testing didn't need to know what they where getting from each tile. It's not like it's a Civilization game or anything.Regardless of what I say, I'm probably going to play it anyway. Because it's generally a well made game but right now it needs balancing. If I was to actually say yes or no to recommend this game, I'm gonna say no for the moment in time. Please don't NOT buy the game for this review Come back when some balancing is done."

It removed some features which made Civ V great, and replaced them with mechanics that make you reminise about Ghandi's war elephant obsession in the previous game, i.e. they suck. This game could have been great, but they changed too much about it. Civ V needed a lot of fixing, and they fixed a lot of it with this game, but they stripped out the bits which made it a truly enjoyable game. And for that reason, Civ VI seems to lack the endless playability present in V. I can't recommend this game."

198,36.9,Not Recommended," August 1, 2017",5,"I just can't do it.The game makes some significant improvements over Civ5, but couteracts those with absolutely horrendous detractions.Pros over V:-The New district system for cities was a genuinely good idea, and as far as i'm concerned-- a major improvement.- few other minor tweaks and aesthetic details like continents-Delegations to city-states-Artifacts and greatworks-Wonders taking up space-housingCons--500 turn limit with no visible way to turn it off.-No way to customize your Civ's names-Fewer civs-Lock on how many civs you can put in a game (I like to play very crowded small-empire games)-AmenitiesHUGE Con:-An absolutely unplayable Diplomacy set up. and it's not something that can be fixed by simple updates, it's hard-coded into each civs personality. your best friends will randomly gang up on you for no reason, and youll gain warmonger just for defending yourself. then when you declare peace the game will tell you theyre friendly again.It's absolutely unnacceptable that this game have such a terrible problem and make it to the end of development. Im not someone who plays Civ and min-maxes everything, or even plays it like a boardgame. I'm someone who likes to put 20 Civs on a Small map with 50 City-states, turn off all victory conditions and play and role-play indefinently. but even if i was someone who played the game in a more intended fashion, the diplomacy system would still absolutely destroy any chance of me actually enjoying myself.There is not ""Just one more turn..."" feeling here... just disappointment in what is the worst Civilization game to date to me.Just play IV or V and give VI a pass unless a DLC comes out that overhauls this trash."
396,137.8,Recommended," October 27, 2016",28,"It's difficult to truly judge a Civilization game this early for more than a few reasons, but among them include the level of depth in the game that makes first impressions difficult to accurately form and the fact that Civilization games tend to start out of the gate significantly weaker than they end up being weeks, months, and especially years post-release.That being said, I would like to throw a strong recommendation for anyone on the fence about this one while still outlining a few issues that may or may not convince you to at least wait it out.Right off the bat though, the biggest question - does the game feel lacking after playing Civilization V with both expansion packs? Surprsingly no, it doesn't. In fact, I was very impressed with how many mechanics were not only carried over from Civilization V, but dramatically improved upon.Faith was a neat add-on in Civ5, providing nice perks that made it worth the effort to get involved with religion. However in Civilization VI, religious benefits aren't dramatically different, but the whole religious warfare aspect is much deeper. There's something incredibly satisfying about being able to fight a religious war with units, without the bloodshed of a full fledged war. The unit variety is smaller and religious units obviously can't attack anything but other religious units, but it provides a surprising amount to do, especially during the mid-game.City states feel much more fleshed out. You actively compete for their loyalty without needing to constantly run around completing quests that may or may not either go out of your way or worse, result in unwanted war or hatred from other civs and/or city states. This was improved upon in Brave New World, but Civilization VI absolutely tops it by making the loyalty itself a mechanic you can directly contribute to, while keeping ""quests"" as an alternate way to gain loyalty.Great Works and culture feel just as fleshed out as they did in Brave New World, making Great People such as Writers and Painters feel valuable by contributing Great Works. Added too are relecs which work much the same, but just goes that not only was nothing lost, but a little was gained.The World Congress isn't in Civilization VI right out of the gate, but if Firaxis is to be believed, this was due to not being entirely sure how to best add it. Just brace yourself and don't be surprised if it's in a paid expansion pack.The new mechanics work very well and give you a much stronger sense of control. City districts are surpisingly strategic, especially later in the game when you start buffing their output, specifically via adjacency bonuses. Even something as simple as builders building instantly but having limited charges makes the act of improving tiles feel more meaningful since you're actively seeking improvements with a finite resource.However this is also where one of the biggest issues of the game start to glare their ugly head. Transparency, or a lack there of, is a major concern. The new mechanics add a huge amount of depth and breath of life into the game, but the mechanics, both new and old, seem to have taken a major step back in terms of ease of visibility for important stats. Information like district output, housing/amenity income, great work locations, etc, are difficult to find, assuming it even exists, and is often burried and consolidated into generic numbers, making it unnecessarily difficult to keep track of and micro-manage them. It's almost as though the game treats these mechanics as less important than they really are. And tooltips are a lot less helpful than you'd expect them to be, either displaying generic information, seemingly useless information or relevant information, or just not displaying anything of value that you can't already see by just looking at it.The game also has a surprising number of glitches or AI quarks. I've seen cases where certain overlay features will get stuck on - such as traderoutes, cluttering your view. Trade deals seem very broken in that on more occasions than I can count, I've asked AI for a deal that they thought was better, only for them to actually ask for less or even offer me more. I've also been actively either dismissed or praised by other civilizations for not having a high gold income when my profit margins are very strong. I've even encountered an issue where a civilization will declare friendship with me - only to declare war on me two turns later.All and all, the game holds a remarkable amount of promise. I have little doubt that these issues will be ironed out in Civ6 just as they were in Civ5. That being said, it can't be emphisized strongly enough that this game released in what feels like a far, far more ""complete"" base game than Civilization V did when it was first released. If Firaxes trend is anything to go on, it's very easy to imagine that this game has the potential to be the absolute best Civilization game yet."

11,45.8,Not Recommended," June 22, 2017",23,"After around 30 hours logged into this game I can say that I am left utterly unimpressed. Civilization Six is not a bad game, rather a dissapointing one when compared to its predecessors. It does little that improves on civilization 5 in any major way, and in very many ways it makes backwards progress. The graphical style in this game gives of a cartoonish feeling that makes taking the game seriously difficult. The leaders are often animated worse than their civilization 5 counterparts as well. Despite this, the graphical style actually did not bother me all that much. What really did bother me in terms of graphics was the absolutely atrocious design of the minimap. The minimap in civ 5 provided a nice, clean overview of the geography of the map and the territories of the various nations. Its civ 6 counterpart is almost unreadable, I honestly struggled to read the minimap throughout my entire time with the game. While the minimap is not necessary in either game, it did lend towards a feeling of running an actual empire, as it accurately charted your territory. The lack of an accurate minimap may seem like a petty complaint, but I truly feel it continues to lend towards the cartoonish feel of the game. The game fails in areas aside fom graphics as well. The ai seems to have made little to no improvements over civ 5, the religion system feels rather shallow, and again cartoonish, in comparison to civ 5, and the world congress is removed entirely just to name a few. The game also tries to expand upon the civics system, which sounds like a great idea. However, the execution of the civics system was lackluster to say the least, and I often found myself not caring or even wanting to dig into the heaps of civic cards the game gives you. In all fairness, there were a few changes that i found to be actually good. In my opinion, the best change that they made was to the city system with the addition of districts. This added an interesting layer of depth to the cities and made effective planning of cities more necessary. Another minor improvement the game makes is to the millitary system with the ability to combine units to form corps and armies, which does make orginization slightly easier than the one unit per tile system of civ 5. Aside from the improvements I mentioned, the game fails to improve on civ 5 at all in my opinion. In conclusion, I cannot recommend this game simply due to how much better civ 5 is. Civ 6 may very well improve with dlc, however at the time of writing this the few pros are simply not worth the many cons. Go buy civ 5 and its dlc instead."

Another thing I remember very well when Civilization V came out, gamers were complaining about that game too. But now they are telling you, you’re better off playing Civilization V and yes Civ V also had flaws per some gamers and supposedly you were better off playing Civilization IV, so you see the pattern. We as gamers are never happy and always complaining about a game. Civ VI is getting better, the developer are still tweaking the game. They haven’t abandon it. So yes, it should have been fix before launch, but the game is out and let’s just hope the tweaks they are doing fixes the flaws the games has which aren’t as bad as some people making seem.

74,27.2,Not Recommended, February 12,8,"When you have announced this game, I hoped that with its release you will fix all problems that Civilization 5 had. However, you have created a completely naked game or, in other words, a piece of trash. And you sell this trash for 60 EUROS.Firaxis, I just cannot understand how you can be so greedy and have such a depraved vision on the future of your company. Instead of fixing Civilization 5, you made Civilization 6. Instead of creating a masterpiece Civilization 6, you made incomplete game and later on you released a DLC which, by the way, costs half the price of the game.

Being greedy will just cost you your future.Getting back to the topic:- Poor in-game customization- Awkward game graphics, jesus christ, it's so impossible to see the hills.- The resource yields are just horrible. I have to play on Legendary start each time and even then, sometimes I get to spawn in terrible locations- In CIV5 when you upgraded certain things with your workers - you received extra hammers, in CIV6 you receive EXTRA GOLD.

98,125.9,Not Recommended," December 7, 2017",8,"Heres an honest opinion of Civ 6. Being the natural progression from Civ 5 the natural assumption of this game is that it will encompass sections of Civ 5 that were good and then add new things to make the game better. Civ 6 in my opinion accomplishes the later, but throws everything that was loved about Civ 5 out the window.Pros:Districts: Districts are fairly well thought out, there are some problems in regard to the scaling of district production later in the game but I think for the most part it works extremely well and is a solid addition to the Civilization game. It also means you cant wonder spam which in my opinion was one of the main problems of Civ 5 as it allowed for people to snowball quite easily if you got set up correctly.Diplomacy: The diplomacy system in Civ 6 is really quite good if you ask me and was needed in the Civilization games, while it is not flawless (i.e. the intel crap that spams your screen or the AI diplomacy) the diplomacy is a good thing for the game.Civics Tree: The civics tree is a good addition and adds a lot of dynamics to the game if you ask me. It makes a culture a necessary in any game you play, while in Civ 5 culture was mainly just a defense against a tourist victory (could be used for policies but policies werent necessary to win a game).Cons:AI: The AI is obviously a big deal in a civilization game and the AI is pretty damn bad, if theyre not basically just suiciding against your nation theyre declaring wars that make 0 sense and are rarely using the war justification system built into the game. They just hit you with some stupid suprise war or they take someone who is a declared friend of yours, and declare a joint war (which isnt as punishing as a suprise war for some reason even though its basically the same damn thing). This game is a multiplayer game NOT A SINGLEPLAYER GAME.Religion: The religion game is much more detailed and I actually enjoy this quite a lot, however the religion game against AI is actually impossible. I have played games where I have done nothing but spam religion and there is no way I can come close to the amount of missionaries that the enemies are pumping out, despite having more faith per turn than them. Its utterly ridiculous.Civilization Choices: One thing that I actually gives me depression is the choices of Civilizations in this game. There are some solid choices that nobody can really disagree with, but there are also some awful choices and some nations that easily could've replaces them. The Khmer for example is effectively Cambodia, and yet there is no Ottomans in the game. We are given Australia and there is no Austria, in the Rise and Fall DLC we are given some random Chilean Tribe but we arent given the famous Incans. We are even given the Georgians, when we couldve been given Sweden, a nation who actually had an impact on the global state of affairs. I don't know what is with the decisions for countries, but they are seriously flawed, when important nations as the Ottomans are not in the game.Cost: This game costs way too much and is going to cost an insane amount of money. I bought the deluxe edition in pre-order. I knew this game was going to have a lot of DLC if Civ 5 is anything to base it off of. In Civ 5 you could buy the entire game, all DLCs for $80. This isnt cheap but its better than spending an even larger amount to get everything seperately. This is not the case in Civ 6. The Rise and Fall DLC is not included in the Deluxe which if you ask me is a huge sham. It also means that the deluxe edition no longer includes any more future nations that are to be added. I can not condone this game to my friends, that they have to spend over $100 just to buy a game that 1) Is already getting bad popularity 2) Needs to be fixed 3) Is showing that its going to require even more payments. Its not worth it to them, and frankly its not worth me spending more on it unless there is a serious sale.Overall:The game is alright, its building up to have a good amount of mechanics that I believe the game needed, and the mechanics being introduced in Rise and Fall further make me believe the game is headed in the right direction to be exceptional.BUT I can not recommend the game. The cost to get this game is the biggest draw back with you having already to spend over $100 to get a game that is not even close to finishing what it needs to be a good game or even what the developers plan to do with it. Get it on sale DO NOT PAY FULL PRICE FOR THIS GAME ITS NOT WORTH IT. And make sure you have friends who are willing to play it, once again this is not a singleplayer game as it is a multiplayer game."
31,746.5,Not Recommended," November 12, 2016",21,"I'm a longtime Civ fan, and it breaks my heart to give this a ""no"" recommendation. Rather than rehash the negatives listed by the previous reviewers, I'll just suggest you read them. I've played quite a few games - and have only finished one. Why? Because towards the end of every other game, I reach a point where I realize that I'm not having fun anymore.Here's what I'd like to see fixed in a patch - and buying version 0.1 of one of their games seems to be the way Firaxis does things.1) Provide an option to automate workers. Yes, workers have ""charges"" but the AI still suggests tile improvements, so it doesn't seem like it would be much additional work to allow you to automate them. This change annoyed me because it was Firaxis telling us how to play the game - I'm a filthy casual, and I hate having to micromanage the damn workers.2) Provide an option to turn off Espionage, as Civ 5 did. Espionage continues to be based on discrete units which have to be built, moved around, and assigned a new/ordered to repeat a mission every several turns. Just a nuisance, especially now since spies can't just be assigned to cities, but must be assigned to specific DISTRICTS. So even if you just want to park a spy in each of your cities so you're not bothered overmuch by other nations, you've got to decide which tiles in what city are going to be protected. Why would anyone think change would be a good idea?3) The tech/social trees are terrible. It's much too easy to beeline to specific techs and skip techs that would logically be required - explain to me again how I can build infantry without learning Rifling or ever having used gunpowder?4) I was about to list #4 as ""make the AI better"" but if they've not been able to do it on the sixth iteration of the series, I'm assuming they are unwilling or unable to do it at this point.Deeply frustrating. So much potential, and yet another product where we wind up buying what should be a late-beta version of the game."
125,339.3,Recommended," June 27, 2017",8,"Overall a good but flawed game. AI can be a bit underwhelming and simple, but it's still difficult with the harder difficulty levels (AI gets pretty big buffs). It's not a perfect game, but it's enjoyable to play. The wonders have good bonuses and you get to watch them being built again (Civ IV). The tech tree is long and varied. The new features work well and the interface layout is much improved. The game has mod support finally, which adds a lot to the experience. I enjoy Civ 6 but do find myself getting bored more often than I did in previous titles. It's hard for me to put my finger on it but the game just isn't as fun as Civ 5 or Civ 4 were. Civ 6 is worth picking up on sale."

91,12.6,Not Recommended, January 8,60,"There are many improvements from Civ V here in Civ VI. However, I feel as if nearly every improvement is nullified due to the unbalanced nature of the AI in Civ VI.I've spent hundreds of hours on Civ V, and after playing a bit of VI, I think it's time I moved back. VI simply isn't as good of a game and, arguably, not a good game in general.Its AI has infuriated me. They are very tempermental, even on the lower difficulties. They will offer bogus trades, such as 10 gold for two of your luxury resources. They will denounce you a single turn after meeting you, immediately again after the previous denunciation has expired, and for the entire length of the rest of the game, simply for following a different path of government. Diplomacy is nonexistant, and only is maintained by walking a fine line, which in turn makes the other AIs hate you. I understand that AI isn't human, but I feel as if it was better and more human-like in Civ V. It feels like the AI are playing you, instead of playing alongside you.If you have and enjoy Civ V, purchasing and playing this would most likely be a waste of time and money. If you are new to the series, only purchase Civ VI if you plan on strictly playing with humans. Otherwise, purchase Civ V. Regardless, until there's a suitable overhaul, this game cannot be recommended."

City States. Barbarians. ... and Deer.Just one thing: The AI is Very Cut Throat. NEVER give open borders or you will be Surprise Attacked and DOOMED.

23,92.9,Not Recommended, January 4,3,"My problem with Civ 6 is that it is too repetitive. It seems like nowadays whenever they add a new civ they are guarunteed a pretty trashy unique tile improvement or building that is extremely limited in use and doesn't really add anything special to the civ, and it seems like all of the unique abilities now are just 'extra (insert yield) for adjacency bonuses next to (insert land feature here)'. There is no variety in the game, and I am tired of looking at the same old boring Cleopatra and Frederick Barbarosa every game.CIvilization 5 was better in my opinion because each civ had an extremely different unique ability, from Morocco's extra gold for trade and Babylon's free Great Scientist. The games felt much more fun, as it took more strategy to beat and counter the several different civs in the game, because they were all extremely varied in playstyle and strengths. Another thing that I liked about Civ 5 compared to Civ 6 is that the games felt a lot more involved and interesting, and getting the victory in the end felt like much more of a challenge, as the AI or another player would always be right at your tail threatening to win another victory type, leading to some extremely fun and close games. Winning in Civ 6 however feels too much like a chore, as the victories themselves are extremely boring and tedious, and the AI is either never competitive or way ahead of you in everything, and the games feel like they are decided long before it actually ends. Getting a science victory or religious victory in this game is extremely boring and tedious, as the theological combat mechanic is bland and uninteresting and the micromanaging of buying the missionaries and spreading the religion is too boring. Civ 6 has some interesing ideas, but they are executed extremely poorly and they fail to capture any sort of interest from the players, i.e. the extreme inactivity in the Workshop compared to Civ 5."

I would give that game 60% which would qualify as a Yes, but I have to vote No this time.For a triple AAA title this game was launched AGAIN in a seemingly non tested BETA state (at best).I love Civ (got quite some hours on the previous titles Civ I-V). But for a game for that price It ain't done yet.Complete imbalanced and bugged. The AI is literally not existing and gets advantages simply by cheating. It is even worse than Civ V.Diplomacy is a complete mess. Well it doesn't really exist tbh.Do not try to get a religion on higher difficulties. Just ignore it. Religion doesn't really exist for the Player. It is an AI privilidge.AI got none whatsoever Diplomacy consequences.For example:If your troops are close to AI Boarders (even if it is inside your borders) AI will complain.AI will move troops next to your capital and you can't complain it is no reason to declare war.Troops will remin there for centuries. Nothing you can do bout it.AI will convert your cities, you tell them to stop that. They agree. They do it again (promise broken) nothing you can do about it. It doesn't qulify as ""causal bell"" for war. same goes for spies.They attack you. YOU ARE THE WARMONGER.If you want to play the game higher than prince prepare to feel the entire game as you were Hitler.Every AI will hate you the entire game. Even if you started out to do a peaceful game.I'm not talking here about the little annoying bugs which are plentyhere a few.-Land units will attempt to engage your naval units (they encircle your ships and you can kill their entire army witha few ships)- Completly overpowered races (Germans, Sumerian)-Missionaries overrun your cities and encircle them making it impossible to move around in your own country ( I counted up to 30 units on my city)I'm used to issues with Civ shortly after launch. But this time it is even worse. Same with Civ V it was really a god game with the first expansion.A playable Civ version cost like 90 bucks here Game + first expansion.I feel that is too much...If you are a civ fan and you can wait I suggest you do so and wait for a bundle price with the first expansion.I hope that review was helpful."

(people coming from EU4 will like this)-Fog of war is visible on the minimap; you can see what you have vision of on the minimap.-AI IS AWESOME (i was denounced in the first 15 turns from hyper aggressive egypt because my military was too small and i was called a cruel leader by Russia that is hardcore science and art)-continents is a neat little featureThings i didn't like:-the fog of war, takes too long to update for my units vision and is hard to read-Ancient ruins/Tribes are hard to see-the movement is difficult to get used to.-did the developers just miss this? there is no ability to turn off auto unit cycle which is super annoying to me (where the game automatically jumps between units for you)-very limited ammount of map seeds (continents, pangea, fractal, inner ocean, and archipellago)-only 19 civs for people who didnt preorder (which will be changed in the future for sure)-barely any change to the pantheons (which means whoever gets one first is pretty much gurenteed to get fertility rights)"

The units (although need aesthtic development) are overall alright although the new movement feature that leaves you with 0.25 of a movement credit left that you can't use is somewhat irritating when playing on faster game modes. However for every step forward, Firaxis has seemingly learned nothing from even the fully developed civilization V game. The AI is without any better word to describe it is ""f*cking atrocious and idiotic"". The fact that you can use the diplomacy system to gain trust only to be declared war upon and denounced is unbelievable. At the start I anticipated the ""era penalty reductions"" to solve this but the slightest transgression will result in an all out war. Science victory's and the collective rest of the possible conditions are only fully possible if you can face off the brunt of the attack and eventually beat them into submission in order to ensure they dont raid your land again. This has happened every game I have played up to emperor (and I imagine the trend will continue and only make the game more difficult to play, and not in a good way). This game is well rounded in style and intial ideas but it needs major work in order to become a fully fledged game worth of the Civilization heritage it claims.In conclusion, wait for the DLC, wait for AI improvements, if they never come (to my potential chagrin) then save your money and time and stick with V unitil VI goes on sale."

Yet here we are almost a month out and there hasn't been a single word concerning a patch. It has been so silent that we honestly have no idea if the fixes are going to happen soon or if they will be withheld until the 'Fall Update"" 2-3 months from now.I'd love to update this review in the future if they can turn this game around.

I've played many of the games in the civilization series, and have 1500+ hours on civilization v on this account alone.Every time I played Civilization V I would literally play an entire game and spend HOURS in one sitting. The graphics seemed great for the time of release, and even before the release of DLC there was alot of replayability.When Civilization VI came out, I was so excited. I heard that the gameplay was totally different.This is the only game in the Civilization series in which I have never finished an entire game. I know i've only played about 7 hours on this account, but for me, 7 hours was about the time I would spend per game in Civ V!There's so much wrong with this game.Case in point, Diplomacy.A nation will be your best friend on one turn and then declare war on you the next turn. At first I thought this was clever espionage, but nope. Its nearly impossible to win over nations with trade deals. Diplomacy is an utter sh*tstorm. Declarations of friendship are almost meaningless. I can't count how many times my declared friends sneaked attacked me... Diplomacy is truly broken. I didn't buy this game at release just because of this issue when i saw all the thumbs down. However, I figured they would have patched this by now.Adding housing was a mistake.Dear god is this irritating. It's nearly impossible to satisfy your people. You think you've got a handle on things and 20 turns later your city is screaming at you for more housing. You can't add more districts because there is a population threshold and you can't reach that population threshold because you cannot add more districts. It's a never-ending cycle and it gets annoying early on. This was never a problem in Civilization V.There are a few positive aspects of the game that I like.They made the game more realistic and balanced by no longer allowing people to hoarde wonders in a single city. It used to be that whoever had the most production would get all of the good wonder, but i'm glad to see that this has changed. Also, despite what other people say, I actually like the new cartoony graphics.But overall, this game was just a complete let down for me. I couldn't say that I would recommend this game, but I would definitly recommend it's predecessor, Civilization V. Perhaps this game will be improved with future DLC, but I just don't find it enjoyable in it's current state."
38,61.0,Not Recommended," February 14, 2017",3,"This game is a step down from CIV 5,1. Music: its the same set of songs and at one point you would rather play in silence rather than hear the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥ peruvian flute music song for the 1,000th time. Also all the music is happy and while I don't expect mozart's Requiem being every song I would like some serious music to be on the track.2. Lack of diversity in leaders: almost every leader is medieval-ancient era, and while I have nothing against this era I would really like to see more leaders from the machine age or even the modern era.3. Too cartoony: this is a little more subjective but I feel as though CIV 6 is a whole lot less emersive than CIV 54. 60$: yeah I know its customary for a new game but CIV 6 doesn't add anything ground breaking so there really is no need for a 60 dollar price tag5. Districts: The whole district thing is a cool thought but I feel as though it is very rough around the edges6. AI: It is♥♥♥♥♥♥ I've had ancient era units attack me during the machine age7. AI diplomacy: This has to do with AI but it is so awful I felt it deserved a section all for itself. No matter how hard you try most people will hate you (just like in real life).Overall this game is about a 5/10 for me and really isn't worth 60$, I recommend just getting CIV 5 with all the expansions.Also don't fall prey to all the positive reviews, a lot of people were in denial of how bad this game is at first, I know I was. But after hours grinding to make that perfect modern age empire and declaring war on the next strongest empire hoping for an epic battle only to be attacked with archers really lifted the veil of denial."

I then played single player games and was happy, but wanted to join my other friends in multiplayer games, all PC players.Civ V became a greater game for me because I could play hours upon hours with my friends, but whenever I wanted to play Civ VI with my friends, I couldn't because of our updates not being at the same time. They would get the Australian Civ Pack and I had to wait a month to receive it, but by the time I did they had a new update making our games incompatible to play.I recently tried to have another multiplayer game since all updates were the same for both Mac and PC, and saw that they no longer can support trying to have cross-platform multiplayer play. I hope in the future they can fix the bugs that will allow multiplayer support for cross-platform, as it is what I bought Civ VI for and am utterly disappointed that it has taken 6 months for this to be addressed publicly. It should not be advertised as cross-platform if IT IS NOT.If you want to play on your own, Civ VI gives the next great challenge for the Civ play, but for Mac and PC friends to play together, it is not available and keeps me from playing the game further."

56,235.2,Not Recommended," November 5, 2016",3,"As a community, we can sometimes expect too much of a developer to always get everything completely right.With the Civilization series - we are able to uniquely analyze and critique the merits and downfalls of the newest release, because we aren't dealing with a story-driven, plot-centred, or character based sequel.Each new iteration of Cilization is almost exactly the same - essentially. Hopefully though, the improvement on what the players find most enoyable is devliered well, shows thoughtful change in it's design, and allows room for future improvement.Unfortunately, after 140+ hours - I can say this is the most disappointing release ever. I won't go over my history with the series,But no matter how much people can try to defend it - everyone needs to understand that this game is incomplete, unbalanced, and far from being considered 'ready for release'.I will change my review to positive when the developers finally deliver in their promise to include everything in Civilization 6, as standard, that was in Civlization 5 and it's expansions (except WC). When they fix the AI to not declare war before meeting you, have all negative relationships, and to not interrupt you every turn. When it doesn't have crippling bugs, poor balance, reinstates features like 'Restart', Military overview, saved options, or the others that were in beta/Civilization 5 but were cut.Whilst I understand it's a game in it's own right - Civilization 6 is a sequel to the proud history it follows. In my opinion, upon release, it is the most disappointing to date, and will continue to fail the longer the developers refuse to communicate with the fans. We judge Civilization 6, and hold it to a higher standard than most, not from high expectation or greed, but because we expect it. I do not mean that we expect too much from the developers - I mean we have come to expect better from them than what we received for such a high price. Maybe that is unfair, but with all it's problems - I can fairly say that I am disappointed in the standard of what they deemed acceptable to release.I enjoy playing the game, but it was absolutely was not ready for release. It isn't worth £50 in it's current state, nor considering the mountain of DLC they will push to improve it. I know the community can cause massive problems for developers when they delay the release of a game - but they should of had the courage to make the right choice, rather than hoping it would work out."

19,498.5,Recommended," November 17, 2017",3,"So much potential, but so much missing or frustrating. Having played Civ since Civ 1 in '93 and only missed out on CivV I came back to Civ with CivVI. Good points, multihex city development, a tech and a civics tree, combining units into corps/armies, Causus Belli - Just War, cool archaeologists. Bad points - no railways (transfromed the world), no canals, limited religions, religions don't make the people happy (that is their primary purpose - to provide hope), Why should Saladin get the Last Prophet? What about the LDS? AI Civs are too quick to label you ""warmonger"" if you beat anyone who attacks you. Not enough great people. Slingers have a range of 1 - the whole point of slingers, historically, is that they could launch out to 300m and more. Ancient armies are not about individual unit types but about the mix/balance and training - so much could have been done here, huge opportunity missed to represent ancient warfare properly. A good game but not a great game, CivIV with all add-ons and History in the Making Mod is a great game. Still worth buying though!With now 400+ hours I still heartily recommend this game - and the add-ons, especially Indonesia etc. I have managed to win at Immortal level but not without resorting to nukes. I have also managed all victories except ""score"" which, IMO, could only happen by artificially not winning another way. So, what could be better?Historically, empires and religions both divide/rebel/schism - this has to be part of any future complete game - Civ VII. I like the religious combat although it took me 5 games to properly understand how it works. I do think that religion as ""opiate of the masses"" is a very strong historical fact which has been wrongly side-lined in Civ6.The end screens are most disappointing - just graphs. I used to love the turn by turn historical map plot of Civ development in Civ4 - this should be available in this game for both cities and religion. It is always good to rememeber where you started.There is no distinction between Barbarians and Rebels and there is no guerilla warfare or terrorism for that matter. All things that could and should be added.The AI is also not very good at combat, regardless of level and seems unable to work out what is usually a very simple chess calculation except that it almost nevr does tactical retreats.My final gripe, for now, is that the zoom out on the normal map is not far enough and needs to zoom out to world view.BUT - I can live with all that! As a game it has a great engaging and immersive feel. 100% buy recommend/"
239,22.0,Recommended," October 23, 2016",3,"After 12 hours of gameplay, I came to a conclusion that Civilisation-6 was an experiment, developers did NOT redesign the whole game (i.e. combat is mostly the same) and left a few other previously known features mostly unchanged, but they made more focus on the small things, which may only be appreciated by limited audience (including me).Highs (SUBJECTIVE):- Visuals and UI feels more intuitive than in previous games.- War justifications result in different warmonger score: Relegious wars, Formal wars, etc.- Leaders forgive your aggression as the time progresses.- District concept is simple to grasp.- Exploration feels more interesting than in previous games,- I like the new fog of war mechanics.- When you re-prioritise your city's foucs (food, production, science...), the improved titles change their appearance (i.e. fields become greener / browner).- Continent names!- Multuple map modes (religious overview, governmental forms, etc. similar to EU4).- Each civilisation has a music theme that evolves in complexity every two eras.Lows (SUBJECTIVE):- AI: ""I do not care that you have the largest tank fleet in the world, my cavemen with clubs will beat the hell of your tank's paint... and while I do that, let me build a new city on the border with you"".- Starting positions seem to be poorly thought through - you start way to close to other civilisations.- Religious victory is too over-powered - should be not 51% but rather 91% of another's civilisation's cities following the religions.- Scientific boosts are over-powered (50% for most of things that you would do naturally). I end up entering Industrial era in 10th century. Should either have slighly reduced boost (i.e. 10-25%) or have higher triggering conditions.- Half of the cultural cards are rubbish.- Most of the great people do not bring great benefits.- The new happiness mechanic is not clear (may well be part of my learning curve).- Micro-management is way too admin-driven (I would like to be able to auto-renew trades based on simple conditions, such as keep this route internal with the larges production output, followed by largest income, followed by largest food, etc.).- District repariments are tedious (""Okay, bunch of rebels decided to burn a few tiles and now it will take me 20 turns to get the city of where it was and I cannot use builders to boost / auto-complete repairs)."

I'm not a huge fan of it, but I don't necessarily hate it.-Wonders aren't exactly as often used from what I've seen, played deity and I think Hermitage(?) was still up for grabs until renaissance era.- Probably just me, but I find the whole religion combat and religion strategy confusing as a whole.- For a game with Clash of Clans like graphics, thing makes my computer run a little hot- The AI... Just, why? After so many complaints from Civ 5 over the AI, little has changed. Tsk tsk.- Want to win? F*** your science, culture and diploma- oh wait there is no diplomacy victory, domination is the only real practical way to win and is the go-to ez pz route.- Nearly all the (good) civs are military boosted for their bonus, again, say goodbye to science/culture/diplomatic victories.- City states are pretty much forgotten about, you do a quest here and there, send them some envoys and thats all you can do with them really.Stop freaking releasing half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥games then unloading a plethora of scenarios (NO ONE FREAKING ASKED FOR) and unbalanced civs for a ridiculous price.

In between selecting units the game will go HEY SEE THIS MISSIONARY OVER HERE THAT YOU FORGOT ABOUT? STARE AT IT AND GIVE IT AN ORDER FORGET ABOUT THE UNIT YOU WANTED TO SELECT!!!! which makes 1 turn on a large map take maybe 15 mins, inbetween the game correcting which unit you want to select, and also the having to reassign every spy every 4 turns when you just want it to counterspy for all eternity turns this game into a clickfest and makes the game more of a chore than an actual game. also the fact that missionaries block military units path is incredibly frustrating because 1 civ most of the time ghandi will spam missionaries in your territory or on the middle of the battlefield and wreck any of your plans on having a fun game plus the lack of mod support on a game that should be a mod heaven really speaks as to how little the devs care.The other issue with this game is the difficulty. When I first started I played on prince and found my self attacked by 3 of my allies on the same turn. Me being stupid, thinking the devs built a half brained ai, had no military and died. The next game I played on settler and the same thing happened this would maybe be ok on diety but SETTLER????

As this happened, the other civs that he befriended within those 10 turns also instantly declared war on me. As this happened the next 2 turns were equally as worse. I had met 3 other civs (playing on Continents) of whom instantly denounced me. They are really hard to befriend. Even after 300 turns of one game.I do miss the feature that you can't rename cities or religions (or I just can't read). But you can rename units and put them into ""Corps"" or ""Armies"" which is very useful (basically a hybrid army that consists of 2 or 3 of the same unit).This game is amazing.

It made me mad, really mad, repeatedly.If you found the religion aspect of Civ 5 to be a little obnoxious or inconvenient, well the made it 100x worse in Civ 6. Prepare yourself for a never ending flood (and I mean FLOOD) of Apostles and Missionaries converting your cities regardless of whether or not you have Inquisitors stationed there (oh yeah, it's a blast), also, they can attack and kill your religious units that aren't stationed in city. It's a real hoot.As for city building, you'll be constantly fighting to build enough amenities and housing capacity to accomodate your growing population. You will forever be just slightly ahead of the growth, and if you fall behind get ready for zero growth and unhappy citizens that could revolt at any moment. Again, a real hoot.Districts: barely worth the time investment until about the industrial age, at which point they finally get the upgrades you've been waiting centuries for.Wonders: The best thing about them is their cinematic construction. Other than that, only a couple are worth more than the tile you must give up in order to build it.

195,74.4,Not Recommended," October 26, 2016",3,"I finally reached the modern era as Victoria, my redcoats marched along with tanks against enemies still fielding catapults. If you can get a few friends to play, I say go for it. However, playing against the AI is incredibly dull and schizophrenic. I can honestly say I did not enjoy the time I played.The new diplomacy features do very little in a practical sense, of all the games I’ve played they hate me within a few turns no matter what I do. And the few AI I befriend will launch a surprise war with no obvious provocation. So, I just fight everyone forever because there doesn’t seem to be any other way.I expect there will be some massive patches or DLC that will tune the AI, so hopefully we won’t have long to wait.-Post Patch-The AI still acts surprisingly dull. My most recent game, within 10-15 turns of meeting a civ, they denounced and promptly declared war upon me. They then proceeded to do nothing for the rest of the game. I gave up when I found that all the AI seemed confused with the idea of a naval invasion, their entire army sat off their coast while my ships tore through them.As the player population has dropped 2/3 to practically the level of Civ5, I think in general the community has given up for the near future. Maybe after a few years of play testing they can sort out their AI logic. Until then, don't bother. I regret this purchase almost as much as No Mans Sky."

Most of the new features sound like a good idea, and in part they are, but most all have a big negative to them. I could type out all the problems for hours, but I will just give a few to save time.New city district system sounds good, but you are still stuck building only one thing a turn despite having all these seperate building complexes. Then builders are only good 3 times, so you have to spend extra build time on them. And if something gets damaged you have to repair it via the build system. That sometimes takes 9+ turns! It can also take several turns for your troops to simply go from one side of your city to the other.Roads are built automatically by traders. Sounds good, but that means you have to send traders to every city even if you don't want to. So you have to send one from City A to City B, City B to City C, City C to City A, and so on. You can get an engineer to build roads,... ONE TILE AT A TIME!AI leaders seem to be bipolar. They shame you over the size of your military, and then the very next turn say how impressive it is. They will delare war on you, and then just sit there and never send any troops. Also enemy units sometimes get stuck and never move from a tile.You now gain influence over city states by sending them envoys, but it's a constant see-saw battle with the AI. You send 5 envoys. They send 6. Then you send 7, so they send 8. In one game I kept losing my caravans because my max number would constantly be changing from 5 to 10 because my influence would rise and fall constantly.Religon? Nope. Not even going to go there. The changes sound good on paper, but it sucks. I turned off religion victory and just avoid all of it.Notification! Notifications have been reduced to a tiny hidden button on the lower right. I had barbarians running thru my capital and never knew. Is someone close to victory? Well you better constantly be checking the victory tab or you'll never know. I lost a game and I still don't know why! The end screen doesn't even show who or how they won!Meh, I don't want to go on any longer. I can see a good game here, but so much needs to be fixed.

Google ""Civ 6 crash to desktop"" and see the numerous people plagued with this above common problem.The Good: It follows the traditional Civilization Genre of planning and strategy. There are aspects that do become tedious during gameplay. Ex. No automated production forces you to constantly choose the same item in later turns of the game.Overall: It is enjoyable If your able to play without problem.WHY I would NOT recommend this game. Games are supposed to be fun and relaxing. Only it isnt when you're 30 or 200 turns into a game and crash. You cant even reload and continue because at that point it keeps doing it on that particular moment. The issue of crashing to desktop for no rhyme or reason is very frustrating. Tenaciously, I have tried a multitude of things to fix the issue. Declared war, made trades, loaded saved games to earlier turn, changed civics etc. Checked game integrity, windows updates, turned off firewall, Reloaded drivers, Uninstalled/Re-installled game and many other things that would normally cause hiccup errors.Bottom line: There is a design flaw somewhere. I imagine it would take the development team to peel through the whole game to fix it. Something thats gonna cost the company time and money.

They would get the Australian Civ Pack and I had to wait a month to receive it, but by the time I did they had a new update making our games incompatible to play.I recently tried to have another multiplayer game since all updates were the same for both Mac and PC, and saw that they no longer can support trying to have cross-platform multiplayer play. I hope in the future they can fix the bugs that will allow multiplayer support for cross-platform, as it is what I bought Civ VI for and am utterly disappointed that it has taken 6 months for this to be addressed publicly.

Civilization 6 represents the least interesting of any of them, and I think that's because there's nothing new here that wasn't already explored - oftentimes with better mechanics - in previous games.

I feel a lot of people get the skewered opion that this game is bad, simply because it has less content, the same idea that ruins each sims game upon release ""why would we play this if we already have all the DLC in the old game and therefore more content"" Ignoring that, this game is great, adds to the series, runs beautifully on high end machines with no framerate issues or slowing what-so-ever which has been a problem in the past for the series. I couldn't recommend more for the summer sale bundle with XCOM 2."

The game lacks everything,1. IAs are stupid idiot and characters are too plain. Every character has only a couple sentences which makes the simulation of a conversation simply WRONG... AIs does things without any logic or reason.2. FULL OF BUGS. I nuked an allied and took cities without declearing war, an ally won't always join war if someone else attacks. If one of those happend you also get other bugs as laking different options while in diplomacy and other details3. The DLCs where ridiculusly expensive, they were worth not half of what i payied. NOT ONE OF THE DLCs4. VERY FEW diferences between civs, only 3 or 4 differences, in a long game you end up using the same mix-civ... result of getting to a stage when those very very little differences just don't apply... and all the civs are the same.5.

16,6.7,Not Recommended," August 13, 2017",3,"I do not recommend Civilization VI to play.The AI is unpredictable at best, and a nightmare of arbitrary aggression at worst; the idea of the computer having objectives (or 'agendas') sounds great, but in practice turns the game into a virtual minefield where in order to avoid provoking the AI you're restricted to doing almost none of the interesting features the game has to offer. Choose the wrong government out of a set of three? Denounced by an annoyed AI. Start building wonders and competing with other civs for the best improvements the game has to offer? Well, you can forget ever being friends with China. Never mind that it can take 100 turns to build one unless you have it in your capital. Try to gain great people? The same thing will happen with Brazil - bid farewell to any diplomatic relations. Kongo actually denounced me the turn immediately after I met them because I didn't spread my religion to them fast enough - there was a serious expectation for my scouts to be followed by a legion of missionaries, I guess. And don't even get me started on the Aztecs and their resource BS, or Greece and Germany declaring war because I want to talk to city states (you know, that innovative new system of suzerian states? That? No dice.)It's a sad game that de-incentivizes its players from doing the most interesting things in the game. The way that the AI works has made the game annoying and frustrating; especially since I honestly enjoy building up the best empire possible with all the benefits I can muster. Add in an infuriating UI that will have you punching your keyboard as your units start cycling through while you're trying to direct their paths, fighting the pathing systems all the way (though that's a carry-over from Civ 5, so I can't complain TOO much there).And don't get me started on Ghandi's mother ♥♥♥♥ing agenda. 'Nuke Happy?' Are you kidding me? You wasted an entire agenda slot for India - one of the longest surviving bastions of culture, religion and civilization itself - on a bad ♥♥♥♥ing joke? It's not even that good from a gameplay perspective. Nukes come in the late-game, so Ghandi's got the entirety of recorded history to bask in his smug irony; How am I supposed to take that kind of stupidity seriously when I'm trying to create a civilization to stand the test of time? Whatever magnitude of purpose the game possesses need only look to that kind of ridiculousness and feel it deflate into nothingness.I also wasn't a great fan of the art style - it's hard to feel truly 'epic' as a world superpower while hanging out with character models that feel like they're pulled from a pixar film. I was prepared to let that go, but the game just doesn't make up for it.I will give Civ VI one thing; however terrible the gameplay is, they packaged it in some seriously gorgeous wrapping. I give a standing ovation to the art team, the graphics designers, and Christopher Tin and other composers for the soundtrack. In Civ VI there are some truly beautiful worlds you can build - while the Ancient Era offers cities that look identical no matter what civ you choose, classical and onwards offer lovingly rendered cityscapes that show each and every building you construct (one of my favorite things in the game, as it really shows a record of what you've done beyond basic construction and food values). The music evolution through the games is gorgeous, and Sogna Di Volare is one of the most moving introductory pieces ever commited to gaming - I nearly had tears of excitement in my eyes while I waited for the game to load up. Sean Bean's smooth voice narrating the game is lovely as well.The problem is that those virtues are still just shiny wrapping paper attempting to cover up the crappy game design. It might succeed for the first hour or two of gameplay, but it doesn't take much longer than that to see past the nostalgia and hype.I have to agree with the dozens of others who've reviewed the game - buy Civ 5, get all the DLC for that with the money you'd spend here, and enjoy a gaming masterpiece with a full house of mods already created. Civ VI might be enjoyable in a year or two once the devs get in the game and the modding community does half their job for them, but it's not yet.UPDATE: I have to stick with what I've said earlier. Other reviews can tell you about how the updates to the game haven't fixed the problems in better detail than me. I won't be buying the DLC - why would I waste my money on a broken game? Firaxis needs to pull its head out of the sand and start paying attention to the serious critique its players have about their game instead of churning out more and more unneeded and largely unwanted expensive DLC. Buy Civ V and see the best that the Civilization series has to offer; you will not find it here."

(people coming from EU4 will like this)-Fog of war is visible on the minimap; you can see what you have vision of on the minimap.-AI IS AWESOME (i was denounced in the first 15 turns from hyper aggressive egypt because my military was too small and i was called a cruel leader by Russia that is hardcore science and art)-continents is a neat little featureThings i didn't like:-the fog of war, takes too long to update for my units vision and is hard to read-Ancient ruins/Tribes are hard to see-the movement is difficult to get used to.-did the developers just miss this? there is no ability to turn off auto unit cycle which is super annoying to me (where the game automatically jumps between units for you)-very limited ammount of map seeds (continents, pangea, fractal, inner ocean, and archipellago)-only 19 civs for people who didnt preorder (which will be changed in the future for sure)-barely any change to the pantheons (which means whoever gets one first is pretty much gurenteed to get fertility rights)"
41,209.9,Not Recommended," August 19, 2017",3,"Have played all the Civ series from I, and after playing on and off for months, I would not recommend CIv VI.There is one huge problem with Civ VI-the AI. Civilization has always been essentially a solo game, you have to play against the AI. Civ VI also continues to be a game about war. The majority of units are military, it's difficult to avoid war, war is central to the game.The AI cannot fight a war in Civ VI. It is not even vaguely competent in fighting a war. You will meet armies that are far below you in technology, when the AI has had clear warning you will attack them. The AI does not update units, at least not that I notice. Units stumble forward, unprotected. There is no coordination of melee and ranged units-and forget air and navy units.Sure, AI is always hard, but other versions of CIv were more challenging militarily.Yes, districts add something to the game, but not enough to make up for the rest of the game. Early play is interesting, but the later game becomes a slog in moving large numbers of units, trying to manage endless cities, and, worst of all , knowing full well you will win the game, if you can just get thru another 100 turns of fighting, converting, or building a space ship...There is no way to fight an economic war. No corporations, you cannot trade money or demand money from opponents. Religous wars are tedious affairs that just seem to be military wars with different units. The technology tree and Wonders are not particularly diffrent from prior games. And CIv distinctions drop off over time. Playing the Aztecs in 1990 isn't that diffrent from playing the Russians.Graphics are different, but nothing particularly interesting or dramatically different from Civ VI.A big disappointment"

Yet here we are almost a month out and there hasn't been a single word concerning a patch. It has been so silent that we honestly have no idea if the fixes are going to happen soon or if they will be withheld until the 'Fall Update"" 2-3 months from now.I'd love to update this review in the future if they can turn this game around.

239,22.0,Recommended," October 23, 2016",3,"After 12 hours of gameplay, I came to a conclusion that Civilisation-6 was an experiment, developers did NOT redesign the whole game (i.e. combat is mostly the same) and left a few other previously known features mostly unchanged, but they made more focus on the small things, which may only be appreciated by limited audience (including me).Highs (SUBJECTIVE):- Visuals and UI feels more intuitive than in previous games.- War justifications result in different warmonger score: Relegious wars, Formal wars, etc.- Leaders forgive your aggression as the time progresses.- District concept is simple to grasp.- Exploration feels more interesting than in previous games,- I like the new fog of war mechanics.- When you re-prioritise your city's foucs (food, production, science...), the improved titles change their appearance (i.e. fields become greener / browner).- Continent names!- Multuple map modes (religious overview, governmental forms, etc. similar to EU4).- Each civilisation has a music theme that evolves in complexity every two eras.Lows (SUBJECTIVE):- AI: ""I do not care that you have the largest tank fleet in the world, my cavemen with clubs will beat the hell of your tank's paint... and while I do that, let me build a new city on the border with you"".- Starting positions seem to be poorly thought through - you start way to close to other civilisations.- Religious victory is too over-powered - should be not 51% but rather 91% of another's civilisation's cities following the religions.- Scientific boosts are over-powered (50% for most of things that you would do naturally). I end up entering Industrial era in 10th century. Should either have slighly reduced boost (i.e. 10-25%) or have higher triggering conditions.- Half of the cultural cards are rubbish.- Most of the great people do not bring great benefits.- The new happiness mechanic is not clear (may well be part of my learning curve).- Micro-management is way too admin-driven (I would like to be able to auto-renew trades based on simple conditions, such as keep this route internal with the larges production output, followed by largest income, followed by largest food, etc.).- District repariments are tedious (""Okay, bunch of rebels decided to burn a few tiles and now it will take me 20 turns to get the city of where it was and I cannot use builders to boost / auto-complete repairs)."

84,78.7,Not Recommended," August 9, 2017",3,"I can't put my finger on exactly what is wrong with Civ VI, compared to IV and V which I played both religously. I think the best word would be slow. The game physically runs faster and smoother than V did, yet mid to late game typically feels like more of a chore to play. On all three of the Civ games I have played, I typically like to play around with marathon type games to really immerse myself into the scenario, but Civ VI just does not do a great job of grabbing my attention.The enemy AI, much hyped in pre-release as a smarter and more realistic gang- is hilariously unprepared at standard difficulty. Gone are the attempts to create world congress deals and precarious alliances, replaced with Bismark being mad that I am sending envoys to Carthage or Norway sneering at my landlocked nation not having a sea unit. The goals of each nation overbear the international politics like Civ V's tendency to denounce on crack. By end game EVERYONE is hostile to each other and there's no way for anyone to compete with a human player.Finally, we'll get to the real reason everyone is angry with this game, and that's the laughable DLC model. Paying 5 dollars for each civilization or 3 dollars for a few maps is completely over the line. Compare to how much content released as each expansion of previous Civ games, and this feels more and more like a slap in the face to people who enjoy this series. Why would I want another civilization with even more asanine goals to deal with? I was really excited to play this game, heck I pre-ordered the digital deluxe edition. But this is just another step in the Bethesda, EA, model of more money for less content.Get Civ V with all the DLC on the next steam sale, and enjoy yourself."

I have no idea what the AI is thinking and when they do fight you they throw all their ancient era units against your modern army. Every war I have fought has been terribly one sided. And they always end up hating you no matter what you do so why bother.The district aspect might be fun if you had any idea why. You can do things one time and not the another. So you just end up throwing down districts for amenitites. There is no explanation why things happen or don't happen. So you need to figure out the why most of the time. Even then sometimes you just can't figure out why. Like religions, what do they do. Why even bother? I really can't find a real reason to pursue one. I usually forget about religions until the my civ in flooded with tons of missionary units. It's like they are cockroaches, they just keep coming. I ask the the other civ to stop. They say sure and but they keep coming.I have tried many different rulers and set ups but it always ends up the same way.

This is an amazing game with the exception of one critical failure, the civilization AI is terrible. Each Civ has built in things that they cannot abide. For example Rome does not like Civs that don't expand. If you don't capture lots of lands then Caesar is going to have a problem with you. Of course he also does not like it if you settle to close or have a strong military. Basically you are screwed either way with him. That pretty much sums up the diplomacy experience right there. Each leader has things it likes and dislikes so if you play with 6 or 7 of them you absolutely with♥♥♥♥♥♥off half of them. They will declare war on you, you will defend yourself then get slammed as a warmonger when you didn't even start the danged thing. It is pretty terrible and not much fun to play. Everything else is good in this version, but the AI is just a no go. This absolutely needs to be fixed and I honestly just do not understand what the developers were thinking.

They would get the Australian Civ Pack and I had to wait a month to receive it, but by the time I did they had a new update making our games incompatible to play.I recently tried to have another multiplayer game since all updates were the same for both Mac and PC, and saw that they no longer can support trying to have cross-platform multiplayer play. I hope in the future they can fix the bugs that will allow multiplayer support for cross-platform, as it is what I bought Civ VI for and am utterly disappointed that it has taken 6 months for this to be addressed publicly. It should not be advertised as cross-platform if IT IS NOT.If you want to play on your own, Civ VI gives the next great challenge for the Civ play, but for Mac and PC friends to play together, it is not available and keeps me from playing the game further."

In this game: The barbarians and some of the civilizations makes it impossible to win other victories than domination in this game. You spend so many turns in every city building only militairy units defending yourself that nothing else gets built. If you do get the chance to build anything else you first have to build districts that takes sooooo many turns to build. Sounds fun on paper to have districts but you also have to sacrifice one square to build them and don´t expect to be able to build them all because of game restrictions and lack of city area. I feel the same about building wonders (which are not very useful at all). If you do get ahead in some of the other areas then get prepared to get attacked by rediculously many units by the AI. Then you also have to keep spending turns on building builders to repair everything. And be prepared to have to build lots of them becase they only last for 3 uses (or playing as China, 4 turns) Then fun of the game being diverse is gone.I think the game have some really good ideas in form of the eurekas, a tech tree and a civics tree, special people but the game is not fun to play unless you only go for domination victory every game you play due to the imbalances."
226,124.7,Not Recommended," April 23, 2017",3,"I was really looking forward to this game after all the enjoyment I got out of Civ V, but, unfortunately, Civ 6 just constantly tests my patience.There were some good design decisions brought in with Civ 6, but the AI seems to have really suffered for it. I'm not even talking about the constant, random denouncements or joint wars either. I mean the AI, literally, cannot use ships or planes. The AI is also pretty bad at district placement which means most AI cities won't even be worth capturing. But, of course, you have to because of the massive warmonger penalties to razing cities.The final straw for me though was discovering a bug when retaking a captured city that can cause the ""cede city"" option to just not appear on the trade screen. This means said city is just under perma-occupation and basically worthless. I've never really enjoyed combat in Civ 6, but a bug that's been in the game for months which makes defending yourself/retaking territory pointless just adds to the frustration of it all.Civ 6 is still a mess in its current state. It's hard to say if one expansion can fix it, but I certainly hope so."

288,70.9,Recommended," October 21, 2016",3,"While there are still some annoyances, like- Tactics AI is pretty much the same as Civ V and with the new additions of unit stacking is even less able to cope with warfare- Desync issues in MP- Clunky/Slow unit management.the new additions like districts, civics and religious war make the game much more complex, but its not meaningless complexity. On the contrary, it feels much less arbitrary than ""burn a great scientist for 1000 science"" and it switches things up.So in the end, while this is not perfect, it is better than Civ V in every regard and there is no reason to play Civ V over this."
226,292.5,Not Recommended," January 14, 2017",3,"The f'ck'n AI is still messed up! So...prepare to get attacked every now and then...even by your best friend neighbour. You simply can't trust any computer controlled empire. As soon you reach atomic age, all will be permanent angry on you, no matter what you do to avoid missunderstandings. Just forget about working diplomacy and sign treaties only on a ad-hoc base for actual benefits.Usually I'd give bad review, but all in all I encountered lot's of smaller and bigger upgrades toward former Civ games.At least upgrading/melting similar units into Corps (2x) or Armys (3x) enhances gameplay in the later eras. Remembering the awfull moving problems if your army wanted to attack a city surrounded by hills in Civ5. Now you just melt your 3 infantry into a powerfull single infantry army and go for the fight. This really changes gameplay into much better tactical experience.Also the city buildup with specialized 'gated communities' leaves you a lot of interesting choices. You pick one land/sea tile for your special site, like harbour or religious area. After this, you encounter lot's of enhancements to that site, like maybe lighthouse for the harbour, which doesn't need you to pick another tile for the build. This offers every city the possibility for unique shape. Ok, the basic system is copy from Endless Legend, but it fits quite nice into Civ6.What really get's me mad is the permanent threat of war, so you can't play game like scientist or peacefull builder as in former versions. On the other side, you are permanently questioned to do important judgments to deal with the threats. I do hope they'll patch this in the future, otherwise the game has turned into a war-beast.Anther spitting in customers face is the price level they ask for Civ6. If you could grab the game for half of current requested fee, you may get what you pay for. Any higher charge...well, how about sending me your email, so I could give you my PayPal contacts and you could just send your spare money over instead of wasting it? *subtle irony off*One may be disappointed by more and more comic graphics, but hey, it is a strategy game and I also had fun with games which only showed letters on a map instead units. So, for me it isn't too much of a problem...and the landscapes, trees, surroundings, day-and-night circle and other aspects do compensate in my eyes.There are allready mods out there (civfanatics and else), so you may also grab the common version and wait for later season pass offers.So...my short impression at the moment is, they managed to keep the 'only one more turn' feeling, but have to upgrade their way to early released beta. But except Paradox, all distributors throw out games too early at the moment. ^^____Update:After a while playing with mods quite ok, they patched Civ6 and from that time, some mods do not longer work with other mods. No reasoning. Tested hours...only new civilizations, which of course do not compromize gamecode. No chance to get a game running.So, Firaxis did it again. Review changed to negative. Can not longer recommand this game.____Biggest Bummer 2017"

63,215.1,Not Recommended," November 25, 2016",3,"Hello everyone,Steam sadly got only YES or NO. I would give that game 60% which would qualify as a Yes, but I have to vote No this time.For a triple AAA title this game was launched AGAIN in a seemingly non tested BETA state (at best).I love Civ (got quite some hours on the previous titles Civ I-V). But for a game for that price It ain't done yet.Complete imbalanced and bugged. The AI is literally not existing and gets advantages simply by cheating. It is even worse than Civ V.Diplomacy is a complete mess. Well it doesn't really exist tbh.Do not try to get a religion on higher difficulties. Just ignore it. Religion doesn't really exist for the Player. It is an AI privilidge.AI got none whatsoever Diplomacy consequences.For example:If your troops are close to AI Boarders (even if it is inside your borders) AI will complain.AI will move troops next to your capital and you can't complain it is no reason to declare war.Troops will remin there for centuries. Nothing you can do bout it.AI will convert your cities, you tell them to stop that. They agree. They do it again (promise broken) nothing you can do about it. It doesn't qulify as ""causal bell"" for war. same goes for spies.They attack you. YOU ARE THE WARMONGER.If you want to play the game higher than prince prepare to feel the entire game as you were Hitler.Every AI will hate you the entire game. Even if you started out to do a peaceful game.I'm not talking here about the little annoying bugs which are plentyhere a few.-Land units will attempt to engage your naval units (they encircle your ships and you can kill their entire army witha few ships)- Completly overpowered races (Germans, Sumerian)-Missionaries overrun your cities and encircle them making it impossible to move around in your own country ( I counted up to 30 units on my city)I'm used to issues with Civ shortly after launch. But this time it is even worse. Same with Civ V it was really a god game with the first expansion.A playable Civ version cost like 90 bucks here Game + first expansion.I feel that is too much...If you are a civ fan and you can wait I suggest you do so and wait for a bundle price with the first expansion.I hope that review was helpful."
447,74.1,Recommended," October 21, 2016",3,"I need to just chime in against some of the hate that I'm seeing in the reviews. Here's the thing haters: You guys have hated on every single Civilization game that has come out. You have claimed that it is bad and that the previous one (this this case Civ V) was far superior (and in some cases the ""Golden Age"" of Civilization games). Then the next one comes out and you sing the same tune about the one that you so boldly claimed sucked.We all recall how much you guys hated on Civ V for being hex tiles and only allowing one unit per tile. Now you love it and this game (that you played for 2-3 hours) is the one that sucks. It's a really disgusting aspect of an otherwise amazing Civilization community. And a LOT of the negative reviews are following this mantra.The game is great. It's Civ V with some improvements, changes, and a new coat of paint. They have streamlined (not dumbed down) some aspects of the game, which is a great thing. They've made it so cities require a bit more thought to manage (e.g. Wonders take up tiles). And it's overall just a fantastic new iteration into the franchise we all know and love. Sure, it needs some work. But so does every Civ game when it first comes out. I have no doubt that they will polish it up with free patches and then expand upon it further with some expansion packs.Don't believe the hate. The game is not perfect (no Civ is when it's released) but it's a great addition to the franchise and well worth your $60. You will once again spend your night saying ""One more turn"" until it's time to get up for work.SCORE: 9/10(Disclaimer: I have played far more than 2 hours. I played before release (not on steam) at multiple stages of development as well as the release candidate version. I've probably put in a total of 40-50 hours so far and I see no end in sight. And if you don't believe me then that's fine. I got nothing to prove and I don't really care if you believe me or not)Edits/Additions:- One of the biggest and most consistent complaints is that you can't rename cities or leaders. Really guys? It's not that big of a deal and I'm sure they will add that back in.- Just because the graphics remind you of Civilization Revolution doesn't mean the game is watered down, simplified, or dumbed down."
717,45.9,Not Recommended, January 16,3,"I'm sort of happy I got the game on the monthly bundle, otherwise, buying it at full value, or even on the Steam sale, would have been a total disappointment.It's incredible how six games into the franchise the opponent AI has fallen into such a pitiful state. Prepare yourself for the wonders of being denounced one turn for generating too little culture, and then the next turn be praised by the same opponent for having a lot of money in the coffers. Gone are the days where AI would try to keep a semblant of unity in their expansion strategy, now as early as medieval age, you'll see cities popping randomly, especially in small maps.It's incredible how the UI has been mashed and mangled to be almost unusable. Going through great people lists by clicking and dragging a 5 pixel tall horizontal scroll bar, is the most glaring example of the retrocess in this area I can recall. But in general every menu looks bad and unpolished.The new mechanics are also hit and miss. While I like the limited used workers, the notion of ""amenities"" replacing happiness is never properly explained or made visible at a top level overview. ""Districts"" seem like a brute force way of making players specialize their cities, but in a way that is stumped very early as the diversity of districts is connected to the total city population. Building lists are severely reduced and building overall seems far too slow, even at normal game speeds. Having to use civ tiles to build wonders is an interesting choice and it introduces a development vs. wonder victory element. However, it can also be a thinly veiled stab at a popular strategy for wonder victory where a single super productive capital could amass dozens of wonders.And while the visuals of the game are simply stunning and detailed, I am also not a fan of the cartoonish style of the leaders. Nobody feels menacing while looking like a Pixar cartoon, even if they are screaming threats of nuclear winter at you.In general, very underwhelming. Get it at a reduced price if you're a fan of turn-based games or Civ in general, but wait until one or two expansions are out and the major AI and gameplay issues are fixed for a better experience."

Seems like the AI loves to gangup on the player.The newest expansion has a couple of bugs (easy fixes) barbarian units appear out of nowhere when all of your cities are happy. Alliances should be easier to make. You should have to have all of your trade routes going to a civ and bribe him twenty times only to have him say he's not ready to be an ally even though he's very friendly with you."

204,261.4,Not Recommended," October 29, 2016",3,"I really wanted to like Civ 6, but I just can't. Most of the new features sound like a good idea, and in part they are, but most all have a big negative to them. I could type out all the problems for hours, but I will just give a few to save time.New city district system sounds good, but you are still stuck building only one thing a turn despite having all these seperate building complexes. Then builders are only good 3 times, so you have to spend extra build time on them. And if something gets damaged you have to repair it via the build system. That sometimes takes 9+ turns! It can also take several turns for your troops to simply go from one side of your city to the other.Roads are built automatically by traders. Sounds good, but that means you have to send traders to every city even if you don't want to. So you have to send one from City A to City B, City B to City C, City C to City A, and so on. You can get an engineer to build roads,... ONE TILE AT A TIME!AI leaders seem to be bipolar. They shame you over the size of your military, and then the very next turn say how impressive it is. They will delare war on you, and then just sit there and never send any troops. Also enemy units sometimes get stuck and never move from a tile.You now gain influence over city states by sending them envoys, but it's a constant see-saw battle with the AI. You send 5 envoys. They send 6. Then you send 7, so they send 8. In one game I kept losing my caravans because my max number would constantly be changing from 5 to 10 because my influence would rise and fall constantly.Religon? Nope. Not even going to go there. The changes sound good on paper, but it sucks. I turned off religion victory and just avoid all of it.Notification! Notifications have been reduced to a tiny hidden button on the lower right. I had barbarians running thru my capital and never knew. Is someone close to victory? Well you better constantly be checking the victory tab or you'll never know. I lost a game and I still don't know why! The end screen doesn't even show who or how they won!Meh, I don't want to go on any longer. I can see a good game here, but so much needs to be fixed. I'm sure modders are already working on a lot of these problems. I'd wait a few month before purchasing."

41,209.9,Not Recommended," August 19, 2017",3,"Have played all the Civ series from I, and after playing on and off for months, I would not recommend CIv VI.There is one huge problem with Civ VI-the AI. Civilization has always been essentially a solo game, you have to play against the AI. Civ VI also continues to be a game about war. The majority of units are military, it's difficult to avoid war, war is central to the game.The AI cannot fight a war in Civ VI. It is not even vaguely competent in fighting a war. You will meet armies that are far below you in technology, when the AI has had clear warning you will attack them. The AI does not update units, at least not that I notice. Units stumble forward, unprotected. There is no coordination of melee and ranged units-and forget air and navy units.Sure, AI is always hard, but other versions of CIv were more challenging militarily.Yes, districts add something to the game, but not enough to make up for the rest of the game. Early play is interesting, but the later game becomes a slog in moving large numbers of units, trying to manage endless cities, and, worst of all , knowing full well you will win the game, if you can just get thru another 100 turns of fighting, converting, or building a space ship...There is no way to fight an economic war. No corporations, you cannot trade money or demand money from opponents. Religous wars are tedious affairs that just seem to be military wars with different units. The technology tree and Wonders are not particularly diffrent from prior games. And CIv distinctions drop off over time. Playing the Aztecs in 1990 isn't that diffrent from playing the Russians.Graphics are different, but nothing particularly interesting or dramatically different from Civ VI.A big disappointment"

The AI is a mess it always wants to fight you or offer trade that is horribly in favor of the AI. Like every extra resource you have for just one gold a turn, bad. I have no idea what the AI is thinking and when they do fight you they throw all their ancient era units against your modern army. Every war I have fought has been terribly one sided. And they always end up hating you no matter what you do so why bother.The district aspect might be fun if you had any idea why. You can do things one time and not the another. So you just end up throwing down districts for amenitites. There is no explanation why things happen or don't happen. So you need to figure out the why most of the time. Even then sometimes you just can't figure out why. Like religions, what do they do. Why even bother? I really can't find a real reason to pursue one. I usually forget about religions until the my civ in flooded with tons of missionary units. It's like they are cockroaches, they just keep coming. I ask the the other civ to stop. They say sure and but they keep coming.I have tried many different rulers and set ups but it always ends up the same way. Me just steam rolling over the rest of the civs. I have stopped playing it because of the lack of enjoyment.

This is an amazing game with the exception of one critical failure, the civilization AI is terrible. Each Civ has built in things that they cannot abide. For example Rome does not like Civs that don't expand. If you don't capture lots of lands then Caesar is going to have a problem with you. Of course he also does not like it if you settle to close or have a strong military. Basically you are screwed either way with him. That pretty much sums up the diplomacy experience right there. Each leader has things it likes and dislikes so if you play with 6 or 7 of them you absolutely with♥♥♥♥♥♥off half of them. They will declare war on you, you will defend yourself then get slammed as a warmonger when you didn't even start the danged thing. It is pretty terrible and not much fun to play. Everything else is good in this version, but the AI is just a no go. This absolutely needs to be fixed and I honestly just do not understand what the developers were thinking. As much as I would love to recommend it this is a serious step back from Civ V and even from Beyond Earth, which in and of itself was a tad disappointing."

27,44.7,Not Recommended," December 10, 2016",3,"Right off, let me say that after 22 hrs of play, I am pretty much done. I really enjoy Civ V, but not Civ VI. Why? If you read some of the other DNR's many of my complaints are well spelled out.1. Comments about the ""Denouncing"". It does get tiresome.2. Random comments from other leaders - are they supposed to mean something? Some comments are humorous the first time they are made, but not the 6th.3. Missionaries. WAAAAY too many. Especially when they block you from moving.4. Trading. I noticed if they approach you, you make out fairly well. I never bothered to ask them, because that was one area in Civ V that I didn't like and I didn't expect it to be better.Additional Random Thoughts:Spies - there was something wrong there. I had money stolen by spies. Technology Stolen by spies. I think they sabotaged my Industrial park several times. But If I ever tried anything but listen or cultivate sources, I ALWAYS got caught, even with 74% chance of success.Barbarians - erik spelled out the issue with Barbarians pretty well in an earlier post. Here I am in the year 2030 with Barbarians popping up with Mech Infantry and AT Teams. You send in the troops and clean them out and before you depart the area, another stronghold appears with Advanced Weapons. They really need to fade away.Amenities, Housing, and Food. Most everyone else likes the Districts, but with limited space, what with all the Districts I was encouraged to build, I couldn't grow enough food to feed my population. And there was never enough Housing. Odd, I don't think the Mayor, Governor, or President is responsible for building houses. That is free market. I need more amenities, but not really sure what qualifies.Building times were too high. I tried to play this game fairly peacefully and so didn't have much of a standing army. Suddenly barbarians appear with 5 modern military units. I checked every available city and even my three biggest needed 12-17 turns to build one infantry unit. Purchase? $2400! I could have bought three and then be broke. Oh, and no planes because building the Airfield will take 50 turns.Maybe I played it wrong. I know some people really liked it, but I agree with the group that didn't. Oh, and I did play the tutorial, but there were a lot of things they did not explain."

The AI is, well, dumb and extremely annoying at times. Other civilization leaders will pop up and say things to you that make no sense whatsoever. They will denounce you for any little thing so keeping relationships good is almost impossible. The warmongering level seems to be way too aggressive. For example, war was constantly declared on me, and I became the warmonger when I started to win battles – even though I never declared war. That algorithm need serious adjusting.Combat graphics will disappear with some units and sometimes the combat will pause for a few seconds. (I have a Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 graphics card, 32GB RAM and Intel i7 CPU so it’s not system lag.)Again, I love the franchise, but I would strongly suggest waiting until a major patch comes out and then wait for updated reviews to see if it actually fixes things that are seriously broken with the initial release."
123,223.3,Not Recommended," November 19, 2016",3,"At first I liked this game. I really wanted to like it better than previous versions of Civilization.However, after 50+ hours of game play and repeated restarts, I find that most of the improvements are in the areas of the game I never really enjoyed.I like to play a builder/diplomatic style, but the diplomacy in this version is a joke. All of the AI leaders act like petulant children. When they propose deals, you can just keep removing things from your side of it and then clicking the ""What would it take to make this deal work?"" button over and over until it accepts a really bad deal. Likewise, getting the AI leaders to promise to stop settling near you or stop converting your citizens lasts for all of 1 turn before they start doing it again, with no penalty available other than denouncing them or going to war.As for a builder playstyle, even on the largest map with the turn speed set to Marathon and the game level set to easy, the constant attacks by barbarians make it difficult to build out early; and if you manage to survive that (or get lucky and not have a lot of barbarians attacking you), then you end up being found by the AI --- the world always appears to be seeded with an AI civ close to you, and their scouts seem to make a beeline for you.I was hoping for a version that brings in the advisors and diplomacy from Civ III, the sea/space building capacity from Civ: Call To Power, the units/combat from Civ IV, and the city states/diplomacy/culture from Civ V. Maybe by the time they hit Civ 15...but this is probably the last version of the game I'll buy until it becomes more friendly to my playstyle again."

45,119.8,Not Recommended," December 22, 2016",3,"In many ways Civilization VI is a worthy and exciting successor to the franchise, but ultimately it is crippled by a few significant problems.The biggest issues I see are as follows:- The AI is poor which results in games that become predictable and boring- There are no Teams in either Multiplayer or Single player (forget playing cooperatively with your friends)- Puzzling omissions of basic quality of life features-- There is no restart button, re-rolling a start requires exiting to the menu-- There is no memory of the settings the previous game was started with, let alone a template system (this makes the first point even worse)-- There are no build queues-- There is no way to set trade route duration, or to quickly instruct a trader to repeat its last route- The naval aspect of the game is extremely underwhelmingThere are other issues, like balancing the relative importance of production, research, and so on, but I'll refrain from diving into them to state that my fundamental position is that this game is not ready to be offered at the price that is being asked. I'm a huge fan of this franchise and have high hopes for this installment, but after several disappointing patches from the development team that address virtually none of the problems I've listed, I believe players should wait awhile before making the decision to purchase Civ VI."
305,46.2,Not Recommended," February 8, 2017",3,"Meh - doesn't offer much over Civ V.tl;dr Play Civ 5. At 20 hours I was pretty much bored with Civ 6.I'm a fan of Civ titles all the way back to the first Civ on my Amiga. I can't count the number of all-nighters I put in on Civ 4 and Civ 5. Civ 6 feels like it was handed to a team that wanted to go a good job but had no history with the series, and stopped working as soon as the title was ""stable"". I'm not sure they ever played a game to completion either, given how tedious and annoying late game is in Civ 6. If someone told me this game had 25 years of franchise gameplay refinement I would assume they were being sarcastic if I didn't know better.The Good:Builder mechanic has improved.City districts are a fun and meaningful improvement.Early-game road building by traders is an improvementEureka mechanic is an improvementTroop stacking system is an improvement (over no stacking)Great people's unique features were improvedOnly place it crashes is when exiting to desktopThe Bad:The UI: unit icons are semi-transparent on city names = can't read either. Mouse over notifications also pops up the info for tile behind the notifcation icon, blocking the notification. Nothing like the the wheel of leaders to easily and quicly see agreements between civs. Dialog with the AI's have a delay before buttons fade in and it slows down the game - though they're just invisible - they make noise when you mouse over them. New Game menu settings don't remember settings, so I have to set them every time I start a new game. Can't skip the leader intro.Later-game playability: No city production queue, no automated production, no automated builders, no automated trader route assignment or renewal, no patrol paths = an annoying late game, Despite there only being ""Future Technology N"" it isn't auto-researched.The AI: Others have discussed the enemy AI so I won't bother with it, other than to say the criticisms are correct. However, the friendly AI is also bad. For example: Troops on auto explore will ask what to do when encountering barbarians. You move them away from the barbarians. You turn auto-explore back on. They run straight back to the barbarians and get killed. Improving vs the enemy AI is partly learning why the suggestions offered by the friendly AI are bad.Misc:Despite being an incredibly useful early-game policy for winning games, and an integral facet of our history as a species, slavery has been removed, along with state religion. Whales and furs are supposed to be present, but I have yet to encounter them. What made these interesting in the game were changes to their value with the development of more modern technologies and civics.Many resources add variety but are not useful or unique. Might as well call them ""Amenity""The religious unit combat is an interesting idea but seems half-baked in the game.Can't attack, capture, or kill great people. Want to dominate the seas? Use great admirals to blockade enemy cities. The city can't launch any ships nor can they attack your blockade. Your battleship will be completely held at-bay by a great admiral commanding a caravel navy.Antiquity sites can no longer be turned into tourist attactions. I thought that was quite fun.Barbarians: so much lost opportunity. They're pretty much the same as all previous Civs."

74,127.0,Recommended," October 22, 2016",3,"Having played many 1000's of hours of Civ V, I was extremely happy to pay for the pre-load and even gift a couple of copies to my friends.I love the Civilization franchise and have been playing for years, and this installment has brought many new and interesting mechanics to play with for which I am impressed.The GoodI love the new districts feature. In Civ V a new city could start rolling every building possible until you had everything in one city. This is unrealistic and Civ VI makes you think hard about which buildings a new city would benefit from most and makes it possible to have certain cities specialize in different things i.e production, gold or science.The new city states mechanic is awesome, you are now able to send envoys to them which are gained over time, the more envoys, the bigger the bonus. This is also how you take CS from other Civs saving you the gold to use more usefully elsewhere.The new Civics tree is cool, your Civ is now a custom built machine thanks to the government options. This is great but could use some improvements. I would like to be able to advance in a certain area similar to Civ V, but at this stage the process is similar to the Tech tree so you will have to research a lot of meaningless diplomatic options to get to your desired government.The ability to stack troops into corps(2 sets) and armies (3 sets) is so useful when attacking the enemy, it is no longer necessary to completely surround a city with troops to successfully capture it. This is a throwback to one of my favourite Civ games Civ Rev and is a very welcome addition to the game.I love that Wonders now take up space outside of your city, preventing a player from mass producing every Wonder in the game is a good thing for me. I especially like the placement requirements, which can cause you a dilemma when the wonder you want, can only be placed on that luxury resource, the ensuing toss up in the mind has made the Wonders aspect of the game a lot more fun. I also love the new Wonder animations when complete, so beautiful.A good thing about the AI is that they seem to know when defeat is looming, and they will try everything in their power to broker a peace agreement.More to follow in next edit.................One thing I would like the makers to improve on is the AI. During my last attempt, France (at peace with) mass produced Apostles to invade my lands. Normally I wouldn't mind and would relish the challenge of fending them off to save my own religion.However in this instance there was so many of them I could not navigate my own units through my own land! This caused me to lose battles elsewhere on the map against another Civ. Which as you can imagine was super annoying.Furthermore having asked France to refrain from converting my cities, which they agreed to, the promise was broken the very next turn. The diplomacy screen did not give me any means to justice, no Casus belli for the broken promise nor the opportunity to denounce!The AI are crazy! It seems impossible to keep good relations with them. I had a moment where America offered me a Joint War Declaration against France. I agreed. Two turns later they denounced me as a Warmonger. I could not believe it, my best efforts to keep good relations squandered by the insanity of this AI.Another improvement should be the UI. It's too hard to acess information such as yeilds and troop lists and in my opinion makes the game much harder than Civ V.Having turned off the Religious Victory, the game has much the same feel as Civ V + DLCs with all the new mechanics added, it's my opinion that this is where the game needs improving to make this game perfect.More on the UI front, the city targeting button is way too small and is especially hard to click when a unit is garrisoned in the city. Also there is no notification as to when a city can target an enemy, you have to be extra vigilant.I love the new City States mechanics, however they CS themselves seem to have problem conducting warfare. For example if I have one as my ally, and we both go to war with another Civ, all of the troops amassed by the CS do not seem to try to even engage the enemy Civ, unless that Civ unwittingly sends a troop very close to them. There is an option to levy 'rent' the CS army for your own use, but I'd like to see the CS actually help and engage in war by themselves.More to follow in next edit.................Aside from the problems mentioned I find Civ VI a very enjoyable game, much better than vanilla Civ V, however there are some problems which need to be fixed, and as with Civ V, I'm sure a patch or two can solve these issues.As I have said I love this game and I love the Civilization franchise, so a huge thank you to the makers from me, but please, please fix these problems!"
146,56.4,Recommended," October 22, 2016",3,"First Impressions:I was trying not to be so hyped for this game as I thought it may just be a remodel for Civilisation V...I was wrong.Good/Better Qualities of Civilisation VI:Districts are a new addition to the game which creates a more interesting and strategic approach to how you manage and develop your city. It feels that you can specialise each city you own to be more of a scientific or production city, for example. However, unlike Civ V you now do not stack buildings up in the city, you actually have to use a tile to create a district and from there you can build your separate buildings within the district. This also makes the game a little more difficult and you have to be careful of city placements to make sure you get the right bonuses, or have enough space for farms as well as the various districts.All the additions from Civ V main expansions are available in the base game of Civ VI, this makes the game seem more fleshed out and enjoyable from the beginning.New art style is quite weird to get used to, but it grows on you after a while, do not get fooled by the cartoon-ish look, the actual game, units and buildings look so much better than the previous games.The separate research for Science and Culture adds a new layer of replayability for the game. In Civ V I noticed how if you wanted to go for a cultural victory you would still have to put some work into science as well to get the right technologies, now with Civics it makes it easier to go straight to Culture from the start.Linking to the art style and districts, I really like how I can now see the buildings and wonders properly in and around my cities. This is only a small bit but I really enjoy watching my buildings being built in my districts and it actually feels like my civilisation is growing... I was getting rather tired of seeing my Oracle or stadiums being built in the sea...UI is simplistic. I have seen some reviews that are complaining that they cannolt find anything in the new UI after only playing the game a few hours. Yes it's hard to find to start with because it's so different from Civ V, but after a while I got used to where all the actions were and how to access my city.Bad/Worse Points:AI still seems a bit stupid on lower difficulties. The first Civ VI game I played I put it on a lower difficulty just to get used to the new techs and way the happiness is now local. And my God the AI were dumb, the agendas made them all hate me as soon as I found them and then even when I was a few eras ahead in technology they would still try to fight me with their horsemen vs my infantry. Maybe this is just how easy AI are supposed to work, or maybe it's a problem. I do not know.There are some glitches with the UI, the notifications that pop up on the side can bug out and won't show the message unless you wiggle the mouse around a bit. This should be patched if the developers notice it.This next point isn't really /bad/ it's just going to take a while to get used to. The local happiness (Amenities) and housing were a nice idea and is more accurate to real life. However I felt like I just jumped into a Sim City game where everyone had their own needs and moaning at me all the time. I guess it's more historically accurate but it makes the game less enjoyable.OVERALL:I've been loving this game so far, a new experience for people coming back to the series. Although there may be some balancing issues right now I am sure they will be ironed out soon.I'll give the game a 9/10 for now, may increase or decrease as updates or expansions release."

143,107.4,Recommended," October 22, 2016",3,"SECOND IMPRESSIONSWhile I still recommend this game and think it can be a worthy successor to Civ 5, a couple more games have made the AI problems very apparent. It is nearly impossible to get a fair deal, unless through weird jank you glitch into one. It just isn't fun to have Civs pester you with ludicrious demands like 4 luxury resources for a few pennies, turn after turn after turn.The AI declares war at the drop of a hat, even if it has no way or winning, or even reaching you. Often the AI will declare war on me for attacking the enemy they are at war with.OH. RIGHT. AND. LETS. NOT. FORGET. THE. END. GAME. CHUG. This makes multiplayer a slog, as turns take forever, and thats not counting the desync issues I have been having.I will still recommend the game, because everything wrong with it is basic coding, and the core mechanics of the game are solid. With a few patches a lot of the AI and minor bugs can be sorted out. Still, I am a little less enthusiastic about the game as I was originally.ORIGINAL REVIEWAfter the bare-bones release of Beyond Earth, Firaxis was wise to give us a Civ game that carries over almost all of the content from the previous games and its major expansions. Religion, archeology, espionage, most of it is here intact. In addition, the changes to the game have added new and interesting rinkles to the gameplay. Breakout districts for industry, commerce, happiness etc. means that you will need to plan quite a bit in advance.Overall I enjoyed my time with it so far a great deal. There are still some problems I have with it (see below) but I think this game is well worth your time. If you thought Civ V was perfect however, you might not be as blown away, so keep that in mind when making your decision. It is after all, still more of the same with slight changes or additions.PROs:+ Runs really well. No more pop-in when scrolling across the map, and frame rate remains solid even late game.+ Social policies have been broken out into their own tech tree, and you get to choose a government which allows different policies and bonus earlier in the game.+ As noted above, districts add a new layer to the game, as you will have to plan ahead to account for adjacency bonusses and space considerations for new, large improvements such as the National Park.+ Transparent diplomacy. See exactly why a Civ hates or likes you.+ Many other small changes to features such as city states, great persons etc. which increase the level of strategic decisions you can make.CONs:- There's no global government, (the UN is one of the few features that didn't make the cut), and the end-game once again can devolve into a slog when you are miles ahead but have no choice but to click ""next turn"" for another 3 hours before actually winning.- AI is a bit buggy. Civs might change deals randomly, often suddenly accepting horrible offers for no reason, or refusing to end a war when they are beyond defeated.- Cannot rename Civs or cities.- Suffers from (in my opinion) trade route bloat, where half your decisions in the game seem to be just reassigning trade routes.Other points.・ While promised multiple leaders per civ, it seems it is only limited to a single civ at this time. There might be more later, but when I heard about this, I thought it would be more of a core feature.・ Wonders have been rebalanced to not be as powerful as before (a good change in my opinion). They are harder to build and take up precious space for districts.・ I have encountered a single crash at around turn 360. Not sure how common this will be, so I'll keep an eye out for this.In conclusion, while not perfect, the changes are actually significant enough that it does feel like a new game while still preserving much of the core of Civ V."
104,842.9,Recommended," October 22, 2016",3,"Sid Meier’s Civilization VI, released Oct. 21, is a polished game that will have veteran Civ players and new fans of turn-based strategy telling themselves “Just one more turn” until their alarm clocks go off the next morning.Civ 6 is the latest in the series, which started with the first game’s release in 1991. Its success spawned the entire genre of video games known as 4X: explore, expand, exploit and exterminate.In each of the Civilization games, you take over a civilization and must lead your people to victory. Just as with the previous installment, Civilization 5, players can win through science, military might, the power of their culture or simply by having the highest score by 2050. Civ 6 does not keep the diplomatic victory option that was present in Civ 5. Instead, it introduces a religious victory, which requires players to make their religion dominant within every other surviving civilization.Players start off in 4000 BCE with one settler, which they can use to build a city, and one military unit, which they can use to explore the world or defend their city. Each leader and civilization has a unique ability and unique units based on that civilization’s real-world history, and the game attempts to place civilizations on the map on terrain resembling where they ruled. For instance, someone playing as Egypt is likely to find their first settler in a desert near a flood plain, while someone playing as Russia would probably find their civilization starting out in tundra.Players will spend most of their time in the game looking at the map, so the developers rendered it beautifully. Unexplored areas have a “Here there be dragons” feel to them, while areas that are explored but not visible are rendered in sepia tones. Visible areas are colored with a light, aesthetically pleasing format.After a civilization sets up its first city, it will begin to research both science and civics. Science provides technological improvements, allowing players to trade warriors for swordsmen, while civics allow a civilization to adopt more flexible and powerful forms of government. The Civics concept is new to Civ 6 and introduces a lot of ways for players to fine-tune their civilization’s growth and development through dragging and dropping “cards” into economic, military, diplomacy and wild-card slots.As cities grow, players will have to determine how to use the land surrounding a city. Civ 6’s cities expand using districts that occupy the spaces around the city center. Other turn-based strategy games, such as Endless Legend by Amplitude Studios, have played with this concept before. However, it feels more polished in Civ 6, which gives players bonuses to a cities output if they’re smart about where they build their cities and districts.Players will interact with computer-controlled civilizations through the course of the game, each of which with its own agenda: Cleopatra, for example, likes civilizations with strong militaries and dislikes civilizations with weak ones. The leaders are individually animated, and they speak in their civilizations’ language. The artwork and animation style are inviting and make you actually want to interact with them.When you’re not talking with other leaders, you’ll pick up on the music and other ambience. Geoff Knorr is the principal composer for the game music, with Christopher Tin writing the game’s main theme. The ambient music changes as you progress through historical genres and was mostly pleasing, though the Renaissance-era portions felt a bit repetitive.Sean Bean — yes, that Sean Bean — narrates the game’s introductory video — and yes, the character he’s voicing dies in the video. Bean also narrates quotes related to technologies you discover and the intro text for each civilization.While the game’s artificial intelligence is generally smart, it has its weak moments, particularly involving late-game trading. In my playthrough as Sumeria, I declared war against Gandhi. I clearly held the upper hand, but as I conquered more of his cities, his peace deals became more cringeworthy. Civilizations should realize when unconditional surrender is the only option left to them, but in Civ 6, they don’t seem to have this self-preservation instinct.Civ 6 also appears to be prone to lagging or crashing in the later stages, but these bugs are infrequent, and the game’s autosave feature keeps frustration from this at a relative minimum.The greatest value in Civ 6 comes from its replayability. The graphics, music and gameplay will make fans of almost anyone, and with 21 civilizations and limitless randomly generated maps, players will keep coming back for hundreds of hours."

It looks nicer, i'll grant them that.An intricate part of Civ is how you interact with other civilizations, now to be able to that you would have to have a diplomacy system that makes sense, which it doesnt.To give you an example; the mere trading of a luxury resource for another with another civ is nigh impossible.You set it up in the deal screen, they disagree, you ask them what would make it work? Well how about half or all your money you make for 30 turns some cash on the side and the thing you want to trade for my one thing.This happens to declared friendship civ's, civ's that denounced me civ's ive never done anything too. They cannot be arsed.So there's no reasonable trade, (you can get them to trade 1 luxury resource for your 2 for example but screw that im still beeing cheated.)Warmongering: the bright lights at Civ have adressed this (so they claim)So i don't like war, i like to outshine other civ's in awesomeness, sadly some civ's dont like that so they declare war with you, which is fine.However when i then stomp their armies and or towns forcing them to obliteration other civ's hate me for it.If i let them live they will just come again.So you have a choice to either kill them totally and be done with them, which results in their friends and even enemies hating you and declaring war more often than not.Or rinse and repeat the tedious process of showing a civ it's place beneath you every so many years.The ai decision making skills are just outright bad.One last thing; The absolute nonsensical idiot that made the reset to default button in the create game section, it came after one of the first big patches and the thought made me happy.The execution of it however just makes me want to shoot you in your hands.You know how it is you set up a game as russia for example with island plates and the dumbass game just keeps setting you at the map border just because there is loads of tundra an you are left with a region you can build 2 towns on at best, with crappy ground yields etc. so restart time.So i thought wow! now i can just restart the game without having to set all the parameters again which is a tedious part of the game? No,Hell no.This button was made for people who are adjusting their game setup there an then who see what they are doing yet forget what they click , thats the only purpose of that button, an idiot aid for people that do not know what they are clicking an then want to restore what they clicked a minute before. Because leave the setup screen an come back an all your parameters are back to default, which pretty much renders the button useless in the first place.You like Civ? This Civ delivers you some 60 euro eyecandy while playing just dont get your hopes up if you expect a better game, it's worse."

I'm also sick of the nickle and dime DLC nonesense. In the very least put the DLC on sale. It pains me to give this a bad review beacuse I've been playing since the original Civ.

17,73.7,Not Recommended," January 27, 2017",3,"I am a big fan of Civilization V where the different civilizations and winning options are more balanced. In this game: The barbarians and some of the civilizations makes it impossible to win other victories than domination in this game. You spend so many turns in every city building only militairy units defending yourself that nothing else gets built. If you do get the chance to build anything else you first have to build districts that takes sooooo many turns to build. Sounds fun on paper to have districts but you also have to sacrifice one square to build them and don´t expect to be able to build them all because of game restrictions and lack of city area. I feel the same about building wonders (which are not very useful at all). If you do get ahead in some of the other areas then get prepared to get attacked by rediculously many units by the AI. Then you also have to keep spending turns on building builders to repair everything. And be prepared to have to build lots of them becase they only last for 3 uses (or playing as China, 4 turns) Then fun of the game being diverse is gone.I think the game have some really good ideas in form of the eurekas, a tech tree and a civics tree, special people but the game is not fun to play unless you only go for domination victory every game you play due to the imbalances."

226,124.7,Not Recommended," April 23, 2017",3,"I was really looking forward to this game after all the enjoyment I got out of Civ V, but, unfortunately, Civ 6 just constantly tests my patience.There were some good design decisions brought in with Civ 6, but the AI seems to have really suffered for it. I'm not even talking about the constant, random denouncements or joint wars either. I mean the AI, literally, cannot use ships or planes. The AI is also pretty bad at district placement which means most AI cities won't even be worth capturing. But, of course, you have to because of the massive warmonger penalties to razing cities.The final straw for me though was discovering a bug when retaking a captured city that can cause the ""cede city"" option to just not appear on the trade screen. This means said city is just under perma-occupation and basically worthless. I've never really enjoyed combat in Civ 6, but a bug that's been in the game for months which makes defending yourself/retaking territory pointless just adds to the frustration of it all.Civ 6 is still a mess in its current state. It's hard to say if one expansion can fix it, but I certainly hope so."
641,188.6,Recommended," October 22, 2016",3,"This game is a very good edition to the Civilization series.I enjoy the AI and how they are much smarter (even the barbarians). However, they are really annoying. Within the first 10 turns the Aztecs declared war on me as I had another luxury that he did not. As this happened, the other civs that he befriended within those 10 turns also instantly declared war on me. As this happened the next 2 turns were equally as worse. I had met 3 other civs (playing on Continents) of whom instantly denounced me. They are really hard to befriend. Even after 300 turns of one game.I do miss the feature that you can't rename cities or religions (or I just can't read). But you can rename units and put them into ""Corps"" or ""Armies"" which is very useful (basically a hybrid army that consists of 2 or 3 of the same unit).This game is amazing.

Prepare yourself for a never ending flood (and I mean FLOOD) of Apostles and Missionaries converting your cities regardless of whether or not you have Inquisitors stationed there (oh yeah, it's a blast), also, they can attack and kill your religious units that aren't stationed in city. It's a real hoot.As for city building, you'll be constantly fighting to build enough amenities and housing capacity to accomodate your growing population. You will forever be just slightly ahead of the growth, and if you fall behind get ready for zero growth and unhappy citizens that could revolt at any moment. Again, a real hoot.Districts: barely worth the time investment until about the industrial age, at which point they finally get the upgrades you've been waiting centuries for.Wonders: The best thing about them is their cinematic construction.

If you can get a few friends to play, I say go for it. However, playing against the AI is incredibly dull and schizophrenic. I can honestly say I did not enjoy the time I played.The new diplomacy features do very little in a practical sense, of all the games I’ve played they hate me within a few turns no matter what I do. And the few AI I befriend will launch a surprise war with no obvious provocation. So, I just fight everyone forever because there doesn’t seem to be any other way.I expect there will be some massive patches or DLC that will tune the AI, so hopefully we won’t have long to wait.-Post Patch-The AI still acts surprisingly dull. My most recent game, within 10-15 turns of meeting a civ, they denounced and promptly declared war upon me. They then proceeded to do nothing for the rest of the game. I gave up when I found that all the AI seemed confused with the idea of a naval invasion, their entire army sat off their coast while my ships tore through them.As the player population has dropped 2/3 to practically the level of Civ5, I think in general the community has given up for the near future. Maybe after a few years of play testing they can sort out their AI logic. Until then, don't bother. I regret this purchase almost as much as No Mans Sky."

This is the context for this review.Graphics: (intro prettier then for Civ 5, but less inspirering for me)I don't mind the cartoony graphics, it could of been worst and they are well made. They also make it easier to spot the ressources and do make the game more appealing as far as buildings/districts go, if not ""realistic"".Gameplay: (Good game, but missing something...)So far I have yet to get the heart of the mecanics of this one. I love macromanaging, but this is a bit much as far as details go. The base fonctions are similar to Civ 5, but they changed a bit how they work and I still haven't wraped my head around those changes. Luckily, the menus are familiar, somewhat easy to navigate and provide lots of information. They've also made the game more challenging by limiting the use of builders/workers and pushing the importance of fresh water and surrounding hexes on districts and improvements.Old players might feel, like I do, that there is something missing...Some depth or whatever and so I recommand this game more for new player, with reserve, and eagerly await some miracle update that will make me go: ""Aaah, ok! Thats more like it!"".Fixings:-Make the Civclopedia available in the starting menu, not just in game.-Make the map we end up with editable in game, like in Civ 4...REALLY missed that in Civ 5.-More map types (like Earth, editable in game).-The ability to make one's own leader (customization, looks and all).

146,56.4,Recommended," October 22, 2016",3,"First Impressions:I was trying not to be so hyped for this game as I thought it may just be a remodel for Civilisation V...I was wrong.Good/Better Qualities of Civilisation VI:Districts are a new addition to the game which creates a more interesting and strategic approach to how you manage and develop your city. It feels that you can specialise each city you own to be more of a scientific or production city, for example. However, unlike Civ V you now do not stack buildings up in the city, you actually have to use a tile to create a district and from there you can build your separate buildings within the district. This also makes the game a little more difficult and you have to be careful of city placements to make sure you get the right bonuses, or have enough space for farms as well as the various districts.All the additions from Civ V main expansions are available in the base game of Civ VI, this makes the game seem more fleshed out and enjoyable from the beginning.New art style is quite weird to get used to, but it grows on you after a while, do not get fooled by the cartoon-ish look, the actual game, units and buildings look so much better than the previous games.The separate research for Science and Culture adds a new layer of replayability for the game. In Civ V I noticed how if you wanted to go for a cultural victory you would still have to put some work into science as well to get the right technologies, now with Civics it makes it easier to go straight to Culture from the start.Linking to the art style and districts, I really like how I can now see the buildings and wonders properly in and around my cities. This is only a small bit but I really enjoy watching my buildings being built in my districts and it actually feels like my civilisation is growing... I was getting rather tired of seeing my Oracle or stadiums being built in the sea...UI is simplistic. I have seen some reviews that are complaining that they cannolt find anything in the new UI after only playing the game a few hours. Yes it's hard to find to start with because it's so different from Civ V, but after a while I got used to where all the actions were and how to access my city.Bad/Worse Points:AI still seems a bit stupid on lower difficulties. The first Civ VI game I played I put it on a lower difficulty just to get used to the new techs and way the happiness is now local. And my God the AI were dumb, the agendas made them all hate me as soon as I found them and then even when I was a few eras ahead in technology they would still try to fight me with their horsemen vs my infantry. Maybe this is just how easy AI are supposed to work, or maybe it's a problem. I do not know.There are some glitches with the UI, the notifications that pop up on the side can bug out and won't show the message unless you wiggle the mouse around a bit. This should be patched if the developers notice it.This next point isn't really /bad/ it's just going to take a while to get used to. The local happiness (Amenities) and housing were a nice idea and is more accurate to real life.

I guess it's more historically accurate but it makes the game less enjoyable.OVERALL:I've been loving this game so far, a new experience for people coming back to the series.

With a few patches a lot of the AI and minor bugs can be sorted out. Still, I am a little less enthusiastic about the game as I was originally.ORIGINAL REVIEWAfter the bare-bones release of Beyond Earth, Firaxis was wise to give us a Civ game that carries over almost all of the content from the previous games and its major expansions. Religion, archeology, espionage, most of it is here intact. In addition, the changes to the game have added new and interesting rinkles to the gameplay. Breakout districts for industry, commerce, happiness etc. means that you will need to plan quite a bit in advance.Overall I enjoyed my time with it so far a great deal. There are still some problems I have with it (see below) but I think this game is well worth your time. If you thought Civ V was perfect however, you might not be as blown away, so keep that in mind when making your decision. It is after all, still more of the same with slight changes or additions.PROs:+ Runs really well. No more pop-in when scrolling across the map, and frame rate remains solid even late game.+ Social policies have been broken out into their own tech tree, and you get to choose a government which allows different policies and bonus earlier in the game.+ As noted above, districts add a new layer to the game, as you will have to plan ahead to account for adjacency bonusses and space considerations for new, large improvements such as the National Park.+ Transparent diplomacy. See exactly why a Civ hates or likes you.+ Many other small changes to features such as city states, great persons etc. which increase the level of strategic decisions you can make.CONs:- There's no global government, (the UN is one of the few features that didn't make the cut), and the end-game once again can devolve into a slog when you are miles ahead but have no choice but to click ""next turn"" for another 3 hours before actually winning.- AI is a bit buggy. Civs might change deals randomly, often suddenly accepting horrible offers for no reason, or refusing to end a war when they are beyond defeated.- Cannot rename Civs or cities.- Suffers from (in my opinion) trade route bloat, where half your decisions in the game seem to be just reassigning trade routes.Other points.・ While promised multiple leaders per civ, it seems it is only limited to a single civ at this time. There might be more later, but when I heard about this, I thought it would be more of a core feature.・ Wonders have been rebalanced to not be as powerful as before (a good change in my opinion). They are harder to build and take up precious space for districts.・ I have encountered a single crash at around turn 360. Not sure how common this will be, so I'll keep an eye out for this.In conclusion, while not perfect, the changes are actually significant enough that it does feel like a new game while still preserving much of the core of Civ V."
104,842.9,Recommended," October 22, 2016",3,"Sid Meier’s Civilization VI, released Oct. 21, is a polished game that will have veteran Civ players and new fans of turn-based strategy telling themselves “Just one more turn” until their alarm clocks go off the next morning.Civ 6 is the latest in the series, which started with the first game’s release in 1991. Its success spawned the entire genre of video games known as 4X: explore, expand, exploit and exterminate.In each of the Civilization games, you take over a civilization and must lead your people to victory. Just as with the previous installment, Civilization 5, players can win through science, military might, the power of their culture or simply by having the highest score by 2050. Civ 6 does not keep the diplomatic victory option that was present in Civ 5. Instead, it introduces a religious victory, which requires players to make their religion dominant within every other surviving civilization.Players start off in 4000 BCE with one settler, which they can use to build a city, and one military unit, which they can use to explore the world or defend their city. Each leader and civilization has a unique ability and unique units based on that civilization’s real-world history, and the game attempts to place civilizations on the map on terrain resembling where they ruled. For instance, someone playing as Egypt is likely to find their first settler in a desert near a flood plain, while someone playing as Russia would probably find their civilization starting out in tundra.Players will spend most of their time in the game looking at the map, so the developers rendered it beautifully. Unexplored areas have a “Here there be dragons” feel to them, while areas that are explored but not visible are rendered in sepia tones. Visible areas are colored with a light, aesthetically pleasing format.After a civilization sets up its first city, it will begin to research both science and civics. Science provides technological improvements, allowing players to trade warriors for swordsmen, while civics allow a civilization to adopt more flexible and powerful forms of government. The Civics concept is new to Civ 6 and introduces a lot of ways for players to fine-tune their civilization’s growth and development through dragging and dropping “cards” into economic, military, diplomacy and wild-card slots.As cities grow, players will have to determine how to use the land surrounding a city. Civ 6’s cities expand using districts that occupy the spaces around the city center. Other turn-based strategy games, such as Endless Legend by Amplitude Studios, have played with this concept before. However, it feels more polished in Civ 6, which gives players bonuses to a cities output if they’re smart about where they build their cities and districts.Players will interact with computer-controlled civilizations through the course of the game, each of which with its own agenda: Cleopatra, for example, likes civilizations with strong militaries and dislikes civilizations with weak ones. The leaders are individually animated, and they speak in their civilizations’ language. The artwork and animation style are inviting and make you actually want to interact with them.When you’re not talking with other leaders, you’ll pick up on the music and other ambience. Geoff Knorr is the principal composer for the game music, with Christopher Tin writing the game’s main theme. The ambient music changes as you progress through historical genres and was mostly pleasing, though the Renaissance-era portions felt a bit repetitive.Sean Bean — yes, that Sean Bean — narrates the game’s introductory video — and yes, the character he’s voicing dies in the video. Bean also narrates quotes related to technologies you discover and the intro text for each civilization.While the game’s artificial intelligence is generally smart, it has its weak moments, particularly involving late-game trading. In my playthrough as Sumeria, I declared war against Gandhi. I clearly held the upper hand, but as I conquered more of his cities, his peace deals became more cringeworthy. Civilizations should realize when unconditional surrender is the only option left to them, but in Civ 6, they don’t seem to have this self-preservation instinct.Civ 6 also appears to be prone to lagging or crashing in the later stages, but these bugs are infrequent, and the game’s autosave feature keeps frustration from this at a relative minimum.The greatest value in Civ 6 comes from its replayability. The graphics, music and gameplay will make fans of almost anyone, and with 21 civilizations and limitless randomly generated maps, players will keep coming back for hundreds of hours."

57,338.5,Not Recommended," July 31, 2017",3,"It could have been great, but it's not. Building district's and their associated buildings take way too long, leading to the game stagnating after the Classical Era. Also, turns take too long. My build is 32GB ram, a 1080 Ti, Intel 4790k CPU, and 500GB Samsung EVO SSD, which should be overkill for this game, yet it still bogs down mid-game and takes forever for AI turns to process. The religion concept is very annoying, other Civs tend to send flocks of prophets/missionaries that you can't even kill unless you have more missionaries (which IMO is a boring way to play). This leads to me declaring war on the first rival Civ to send over their religious horde. Overall it's clunky and not very polished. The latest update has led to the game crashing on me 10 minutes after starting a new game. I'm still holding out hope an expansion will come out and fix these flaws. It's still Civ so I'll play it, but playing Civ IV or V is much more enjoyable. Would recommend waiting for expansion before purchasing, but I'm not giving up hope."

146,56.4,Recommended," October 22, 2016",3,"First Impressions:I was trying not to be so hyped for this game as I thought it may just be a remodel for Civilisation V...I was wrong.Good/Better Qualities of Civilisation VI:Districts are a new addition to the game which creates a more interesting and strategic approach to how you manage and develop your city. It feels that you can specialise each city you own to be more of a scientific or production city, for example. However, unlike Civ V you now do not stack buildings up in the city, you actually have to use a tile to create a district and from there you can build your separate buildings within the district. This also makes the game a little more difficult and you have to be careful of city placements to make sure you get the right bonuses, or have enough space for farms as well as the various districts.All the additions from Civ V main expansions are available in the base game of Civ VI, this makes the game seem more fleshed out and enjoyable from the beginning.New art style is quite weird to get used to, but it grows on you after a while, do not get fooled by the cartoon-ish look, the actual game, units and buildings look so much better than the previous games.The separate research for Science and Culture adds a new layer of replayability for the game. In Civ V I noticed how if you wanted to go for a cultural victory you would still have to put some work into science as well to get the right technologies, now with Civics it makes it easier to go straight to Culture from the start.Linking to the art style and districts, I really like how I can now see the buildings and wonders properly in and around my cities. This is only a small bit but I really enjoy watching my buildings being built in my districts and it actually feels like my civilisation is growing... I was getting rather tired of seeing my Oracle or stadiums being built in the sea...UI is simplistic. I have seen some reviews that are complaining that they cannolt find anything in the new UI after only playing the game a few hours. Yes it's hard to find to start with because it's so different from Civ V, but after a while I got used to where all the actions were and how to access my city.Bad/Worse Points:AI still seems a bit stupid on lower difficulties. The first Civ VI game I played I put it on a lower difficulty just to get used to the new techs and way the happiness is now local. And my God the AI were dumb, the agendas made them all hate me as soon as I found them and then even when I was a few eras ahead in technology they would still try to fight me with their horsemen vs my infantry. Maybe this is just how easy AI are supposed to work, or maybe it's a problem. I do not know.There are some glitches with the UI, the notifications that pop up on the side can bug out and won't show the message unless you wiggle the mouse around a bit. This should be patched if the developers notice it.This next point isn't really /bad/ it's just going to take a while to get used to. The local happiness (Amenities) and housing were a nice idea and is more accurate to real life. However I felt like I just jumped into a Sim City game where everyone had their own needs and moaning at me all the time. I guess it's more historically accurate but it makes the game less enjoyable.OVERALL:I've been loving this game so far, a new experience for people coming back to the series.

74,127.0,Recommended," October 22, 2016",3,"Having played many 1000's of hours of Civ V, I was extremely happy to pay for the pre-load and even gift a couple of copies to my friends.I love the Civilization franchise and have been playing for years, and this installment has brought many new and interesting mechanics to play with for which I am impressed.The GoodI love the new districts feature. In Civ V a new city could start rolling every building possible until you had everything in one city. This is unrealistic and Civ VI makes you think hard about which buildings a new city would benefit from most and makes it possible to have certain cities specialize in different things i.e production, gold or science.The new city states mechanic is awesome, you are now able to send envoys to them which are gained over time, the more envoys, the bigger the bonus. This is also how you take CS from other Civs saving you the gold to use more usefully elsewhere.The new Civics tree is cool, your Civ is now a custom built machine thanks to the government options. This is great but could use some improvements. I would like to be able to advance in a certain area similar to Civ V, but at this stage the process is similar to the Tech tree so you will have to research a lot of meaningless diplomatic options to get to your desired government.The ability to stack troops into corps(2 sets) and armies (3 sets) is so useful when attacking the enemy, it is no longer necessary to completely surround a city with troops to successfully capture it. This is a throwback to one of my favourite Civ games Civ Rev and is a very welcome addition to the game.I love that Wonders now take up space outside of your city, preventing a player from mass producing every Wonder in the game is a good thing for me. I especially like the placement requirements, which can cause you a dilemma when the wonder you want, can only be placed on that luxury resource, the ensuing toss up in the mind has made the Wonders aspect of the game a lot more fun. I also love the new Wonder animations when complete, so beautiful.A good thing about the AI is that they seem to know when defeat is looming, and they will try everything in their power to broker a peace agreement.More to follow in next edit.................One thing I would like the makers to improve on is the AI. During my last attempt, France (at peace with) mass produced Apostles to invade my lands. Normally I wouldn't mind and would relish the challenge of fending them off to save my own religion.However in this instance there was so many of them I could not navigate my own units through my own land! This caused me to lose battles elsewhere on the map against another Civ. Which as you can imagine was super annoying.Furthermore having asked France to refrain from converting my cities, which they agreed to, the promise was broken the very next turn. The diplomacy screen did not give me any means to justice, no Casus belli for the broken promise nor the opportunity to denounce!The AI are crazy! It seems impossible to keep good relations with them. I had a moment where America offered me a Joint War Declaration against France. I agreed. Two turns later they denounced me as a Warmonger. I could not believe it, my best efforts to keep good relations squandered by the insanity of this AI.Another improvement should be the UI. It's too hard to acess information such as yeilds and troop lists and in my opinion makes the game much harder than Civ V.Having turned off the Religious Victory, the game has much the same feel as Civ V + DLCs with all the new mechanics added, it's my opinion that this is where the game needs improving to make this game perfect.More on the UI front, the city targeting button is way too small and is especially hard to click when a unit is garrisoned in the city. Also there is no notification as to when a city can target an enemy, you have to be extra vigilant.I love the new City States mechanics, however they CS themselves seem to have problem conducting warfare. For example if I have one as my ally, and we both go to war with another Civ, all of the troops amassed by the CS do not seem to try to even engage the enemy Civ, unless that Civ unwittingly sends a troop very close to them. There is an option to levy 'rent' the CS army for your own use, but I'd like to see the CS actually help and engage in war by themselves.More to follow in next edit.................Aside from the problems mentioned I find Civ VI a very enjoyable game, much better than vanilla Civ V, however there are some problems which need to be fixed, and as with Civ V, I'm sure a patch or two can solve these issues.As I have said I love this game and I love the Civilization franchise, so a huge thank you to the makers from me, but please, please fix these problems!"

7,18.2,Not Recommended," November 21, 2016",3,"There has been plenty of feedback regarding the overall gameplay and the completely unacceptable not-existing quality of the AI. I am shocked that the game was released with flaws of this magnitude and I cannot find words for my disappointment after having spent 80 EUR on the ""Deluxe"" edition! However, I will not write yet another detailed review of these aspects.In stead, in the vague hope that all the IMPORTANT feedback provided here by so many dedicated Civ-fans will be picked up by Firaxis and other developers with the task of getting the game beyond these humiliating defects with a XX-gb patch (sarcasm detected), I will state a couple of more practical improvement-ideas:1. Should be more options when creating a game including number of city states, several more map types, choice regarding terrain e.g. the world full of forest or rainforest.2. Should leave the last entered choices in the ""create game"" menu, so you dont have to put all the same choices in again if you start over.3. Reinstate the ""restart game"" button in the in-game menu during turn 1 in a new game.4. Currently not able to liberate city states after having taken them over at part of a negotiation (thus not having conquered them as such).5. There should be some recognition from a city state if you liberate them!6. Add the details of religious pressure to each city.7. There should be some kind of ""second prize"" when failing to complete a wonder first - the materials etc. you spent time on would not just disappear as is the case for now where you receive neither a production boost towards what you choose next nor gold etc.8. Add the option of your units being on alert.9. Stop centering on the city each time you click the red dot on the city when wanting to use defenses against intruders.10. And finally, regardless of my earlier promise not to, I will have to say FIX THE AI AT ONCE!!!!I will come back to CivVI after the major overhaul that hopefully awaits before Christmas - otherwise a lot of fans getting it as a gift will initiate rebellion!"

Civ IV: Beyond the Sword also includes ten new civilizations, sixteen new leaders, five new wonders, and a variety of new units....""That is a part of Civ 4 BtS's description here on Steam. Look at Civ 6 now... You can buy 7 civs and 5 scenarios for £35. No expanded tech tree,no new features,no new leaders,no new units,no new buildings no new wonders.... WTF??.It's a shame. Civ was one of the best turn based strategy games series ever. You'd think as a developer and publisher get more successful and experienced they products get better and better. In reality they get only greedier. There's no passion of creating something great,unique anymore. Just pump out overpriced and contentless DLCs and milk the playerbase instead of making a proper expansion pack like Civ 4 BtS or Warlords was. This game (and many others these days) managed by businessmen who's first priority is making money no matter what, instead of someone who wants to create a great game AND make money by selling it.Shame.The game has some good ideas but overall ""soulless"" and unfinished,lacking.Edit: Rise and Fall is out now. Some like it,some don't. I don't have it and I won't get it till it's on sale for at least 30-40% off. Probably not even then.. I've seen many videos of it, it's just not worth £25. It doesn't have half of Civ6's content to justify half of it's price,does it??. Seriously.. Divinity O. S 2 is £30 and has content of 5 Rise and Fall's...Also,out of curiosity... I loaded Civ4 up again. I was wondering if I really wanted to could I build Stonhenge against 6 Deity AI?. Oh yeah man, easily.. All I needed to do is chose an Industrial civ ( 50%!!!! wonder bonus production) I went with Inca as they start with Mysticism tech too (unlocks Stonhenge) chopped 2 forests into it and voila...Stonehenge...You won't buid a Stonhenge in civ 6 against deity AI ever...ok,maybe once out of 100 games.. Good luck ;)Wait for another big expansion and a big sale then buy the whole Civ 6 pack for £30-40. That's what I'd do if I wasn't stupid enough to preorder it.. :)"

101,72.1,Not Recommended, February 23,3,"I've been playing Civ since civ 3. Let me be clear: I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE CIV FRANCHISE. I have liked every civ game I've ever played, and even tolerated Beyond Earth. There is something about this Civ game that simply doesnt feel right. There are so many game mechanics in place that I feel are really cool, and yet somehow fall short of delivering on a well rounded experience. The district mechanic is kind of cool, until you realize that god forbid you have -1 amenities and your civ starts breaking apart at the seams and you have to entirely redistrict anything before you can even breathe. CIV 5 happiness is relatable, except that you could probably get back on track while also doing other things. The amenities however really destroy your development if you don't have them. It almost has a sim city feel to it, you know plan everything out ahead of time so that its perfect and works out. Which is perfect if you don't also have to be doing 20 other things at once. Which in Civ of course you are doing. Everything about religion is amazing: much more straightforward systme, better bonuses, create a custom religion. Except the religious combat between units. I find myself literally not caring about this aspect that the AI will live and die by religious combat as if their entire civ depends on it. Which makes it more annoying. Every civ game has its drawbacks, but these are 2 really big ones that make the game unplayayble in later stages. Also the map is super cool and I like the way it is drawn and functions, except that it kind of messes with me a little bit too. Maybe that one is just me, too used to the white clouds of previous civ games. In any event this civ game falls short of what civ 5 completed with its expansions. So maybe once the expansions are relesed and essentially change the way the game is played, it will become more enjoyable. However it shouldn't have to do that. Civ 5 expansions made a good game great. Civ 6 expansions would make a below average game good."

272,12.1,Not Recommended," October 20, 2016",86,"I will update my review as I play the game more, but these are my honest initial impressions. At present, I would not recommend this game to my friends because I don't see a compelling reason to play it over Civilization V. In many ways, I find that game to be considerably more fun than this one.I was definitely very excited to play Civilization VI. I did not watch any of the videos or read any of the reviews before purchasing this game. Considering how much I've enjoyed this franchise, I did not expect to dislike the newest iteration and I did not want to spoil any of the fun. Unfortuately, I don't presently feel this game has lived up to its awesome reputation. After five years, many of us still happily play Civ5, which says a lot about how excellent Civ is.When I started my first game in Civ6, I immediately found the UI unattractive and the game world unimpressive. The graphics seem almost infantile, as if they belong in Civ4. It feels like a huge step backward and this will likely harm my enjoyment of this game. I was also unhappy with the available options for creating a game. There are very few maps to choose from (which I'm sure will be expanded with DLC) and very few customization options (fog of war seems to be not only persistent, but also pervasive -- you must at all times have a unit in the area to remove the fog or it comes back.)I haven't played long enough to get beyond the initial era, and this in itself is kind of saying something because I've played thousands of hours of Civ5. I just did not feel compelled to continue in this one. So with that said, there's much I haven't seen. The concept of districts is appealing to me. I'm curious about many of the changes in mechanics. Hopefully with time I will come to enjoy it more. But for now, I just don't consider this a substantive improvement over Civ5 and in many ways find it far less interesting than its predecessor.For those who like this game, you might feel compelled to attack my review on a number of different counts. I ask that you be respectful of the fact that everyone will have a different opinion and different impressions of the games they play. If you like it, great. I'm not really trying to discourage anyone from purchasing it, but it would be dishonest to recommend a game that I may very well not play much myself. Civ5, to me, is still the champ; we'll see if that changes in time.One positive note: The Steam Controller works great with this game. I really enjoyed being able to use a controller."
102,21.2,Not Recommended," October 20, 2016",68,"I LOVE CIV....always have and so far im still excited to spend more time on it and feel it out. I cant say the graphics changes are too bad and the hud like icons thrown in are also fine.What I CANT take are the slight differences meant to ""immerse you in the game"".The instant builders whom are spent in a few improvements.The combat system is pretty broken. Ranged is extremely OP.Every game is like raging barbs. They are EVERYWHERE!!!(although I later found that there ARE ruins and auto buttons for exploration)Basically it feels like a failed attempt to improve on V by yet again changing the entire feel of the game as opposed to continuing to build on it. By forcing one to be ""fully immersed"" in every hex revealed on the grid...you're making me fall asleep with the tedium of nuance best left to automation. Im trying to conquer the world, not go sight seeing.Civ V gives you a clear feeling like you are creating and managing an empire..... Civ VI feels like a hot mess all over the map with no clear boundaries as to who's who or whats going on. It really feels like they took away the ability to navigate the game or control its flow in any tangible way. The removal of workers building improvements and the shift in tile improvement methods (even though the districs part is a decent concept, if not poorly inplemented) seems aimed at attracting new players who might find CIV's learning curve daunting and prefer a dumbed down ""mobile-ish"" version of things in order to keep their attention... a.k.a. ""be more immersed""....In a nut shell Civ 6 feels like yet another game made by game developers that dont play games. Seemingly more concerned with ""immersing you"" in their baby and pushing the concepts they feel are noteworthy from a design standpoint than actually looking at what the player is asking for/complaining doesnt work in the current model.I hope to see some improvements as time goes on. Civ V certainly improved over time (and expansions) so who knows. I just hope Civ Beyond Earth wasnt the begining of the end of a once mightly game franchise....but hey...at least we can still play V."

737,369.7,Not Recommended," October 22, 2016",101,"Steam really needs a ""Not Yet"" button.First, I am a Civ veteran. I've been playing since III was released. I know my way around. This time, the game just seems off. I don't mind the unstacked cities. In fact I like the concept even if the excecution feels weird. I could learn to love it. As others have mentioned, the AI is insane. I can have the largest claimed area and Rome will still make mention that I haven't expanded. The barbarians need tweaking. Even on easier settings, I am spending most of my early game just building units to protect my one or two cities as wave after wave almost instant spawn from camps. Cleared camps will be replaced by new camps a few squares away within a single turn and then the cycle starts over. I'm pretty happy with the near complete elemination of unit automation, but it makes exploration a chore as most scouts end up ""exploring"" by running from the overkill barbarians. The flip side ofthe barbarian issue is that the game is boring without them, so turning them off is a bad option.Now, the technical issues: There are sound issues: the music and voice clips will stutter randomly. Clicking the ranged attack icon on a city with walls will flash the ranged attack targeting before needing to be clicked again (sometimes repeating the problem. The camera resets to the capital all the time: we need persistant unit focus. Every-so-often the mouse just doesn't seem to function completely. The cursor can moved, some UI elements can be clicked on, but not others. Switch mice and keyboards didn't resolve input issues on both PCs that I encountered these issues on.Finally, the praise. I really like the art style. I don't really want the hyper-realism that so many people have been clamouring for. The colors are bright and interesting plus the models are different and well animated. The UI is forgetable, but it stays out of the way.EDIT: After buying some of the DLC and letting the updates settle in and smooth things out, I am finding that the game is downright forgetable. I am not engaged in the game, just bored with the bad war mongering AI that offer no real challenge. Civ 6 is boring, and I hate that, but it doesn't change the reality of it."

319,135.1,Not Recommended," October 22, 2016",335,"I'm giving a very uncertain and conditional no. There's this usual deal - if you make a sequal to game, it's only logical people will compare. And in case of civilization, the game is always exactly the same, just features change. So if you come with a sequal, it should be better then what the players already have, no? Obviously no. It's better then vanila Civ5 - but only because it incorporates features added in datadiscs. Sadly, with some of them tweaked and some removed, the whole game doesn't work nearly as well as its previous incarnation.WARNING: Wall of text ahread. If you want a conclusion, seek the last paragraph.I'll start with the good. Active research is pretty good, it keeps you active. Over a few playthroughs it gets rather repetitive, because it's usually just build 3 something or something else, but still, cool idea and it works.The districts are not bad at all. They are a tad too complicated for the difference they mean, but they are a fun decision and add dilema to the game, since a city typically won't have everything it wants now. Placement of wonders also feels pretty good, you finally won't have pyramids built in jungle and three gorges in desert. Nice touch :)So the two aspects the game was marketed with work all right. Still the bright side I kind of like how great persons now have slightly different abilities that change thematically with progress through eras (early scientist can bring belief for example). Only kind of though, since for most great persons, the dilema known from civ5 was removed. Do I use great writer for one time culture boost or great work? Should my great prophet go on conversion tour, or should he become a holy site? Not here - the role of the character is given and while merchant/scientist/engineer differs at least a bit, the only difference between writer/artist/musician is name of their works and slots they fit into. Thumb down.The removal of dilemas is responsible for a lot of my dissapointment. City states are now gained by sending ""envoys"" into them, envoys being gained via quests (like infulence in civ5) or via a separate ""influence"" resource, which is used solely for this purpose - there's no other use for it. Using money was definitely much better, addign the decision whether they should be saved for unit upgrade, used for boosting city development or invested in city state.Similar thing happened to tourism. In civ5 late game it's an important asset, because it sways other powers towards your ideology and so it matters even if you don't go for for culture victory. Not so here, it again has sole purpose and if you intend to win via diplomacy or religion, you can safely ignore its existence.Remember how you couldn't wait for your new civ5 cultural policy to be finished, because they were all strong and super useful? How every policy branch supported different playstyle? Ok, so you can forget about it. There's a policy tree similar to tech tree now, so you're more or less forced to invent everything. You get policy cards that go into government slots. There's a lot of cards and very few slots. So you'll be using maybe 5% of what you've discovered. Baaaad idea. Actually one of the worst I've encountered here.Above issues are conceptual - they are part of the game, I assume they will be tweaked in datadiscs and one just has to take them or leave them, because it's what makes the game after all. Then there's technical side though.UI is definitely a big step back. I'm constantly struggling to find information which is either hard to reach or not available at all (not even in civilopedia!!!). I was used to getting a comprehensive breakdown on almost everythign by right clicking - it's comfortable and it helps the learning curve, because it helps me understand why do the numbers look the way they do. Here I struggle with finding out what's on individual tiles, what the tile yield is, why are my people unhappy.I can't find my units - they are difficult to spot, the ones that already moved look the same as fresh ones and there's no unit list that would help me find that archer stationed in some backwater colony I've already forgotten about. Attacking from a city is an annoying minigame where you first try to move camera so that you see the attack button hidden behind city garrison and then you wave your cursor around, hoping the attack arrow will appear. If you click too soon, bad luck, it's back to step one again.The idea of chaining escort/support unit to military was good, but why the hell are they not melded together into one unit? If you get artilery with observation baloon and great general, it's two ""skip turn"" and one attack every turn, that's just crazy. It has also often happened to me that my ranged ship sailed right towards the enemy melee, because I had escorted admiral selected instead of main ship and didn't notice.Graphic is personal opinion, but units are less detailed and their attack animation much less interesting for me, the same goes with AI leaders who are... rather unimpressive looking and bland. But really, this is the first thing I'm willing to forgive if everything else works.AI leaders and AI in general - it really really need a patch. I can more or less put up with fact my tanks are meeting club armed warriors someone forgot to upgrade. But then there's England boldly declaring war on me. Driving 18 heavy chariots to surround my city (defended with a musketeer, ok, England is a bit backwards). And then it probably realizes attacking would be futile and just stands around, driving back and forth, doing nothing. I suspect that with such high number of units, it might even be able to break through the defenses eventually (losing 17 of them and maybe getting a city). But no, it just watches how fire from the city massacres them and that's the point where I'm considering just dropping the game till a few patches, because there's no challange in it and no fun.To give a final point - it's a good game, which is hardly a praise for a sequel of a marvelous game. It urgently needs AI patches. It would benefit from redesign of UI. Features are... okeyish. There's the feeling of novelty and there's the promise of datadiscs making it grand again. But so far it's merely good."
89,6.8,Not Recommended," October 21, 2016",245,"While this game offers many improvements over Civ5.In some ways it's a big downgrade.Let's start with the UI problems.The UI for city view looks like this[i.rdthrne.com]. I can click a few buttons and then it looks like this[i.rdthrne.com]; which, in my opinion, should be the default view. Every time I open up the city view, I have to click those buttons again. I have no clear overview of my cities or what I can do with them.When I hover over tiles I want to see immediate results. I can't do that in civ6. There's not even a setting for changing the popup speed. There was one in civ5. I can't understand why this was removed in civ6. Makes zero sense to me.When I'm in the leaderscreen it takes a second or so for the buttons to appear. I read faster than they appear, so I end up getting annoyed at it because I have to wait for the buttons to appear. Pretty annoying.Sometimes I select a unit before my turn starts with the intention to move it somewhere. Or sometimes I want to click on a unit after I've moved another unit. This game doesn't want me to. Because it automatically selects another unit that is in need of action. I've lost a settler to barbarians because of this.Barbarians. Don't get me started on the barbarians. I didn't like barbarians in civ5. They had little impact on the game beyond forcing you to build a few archers. They were annoying, but that's it. I could play with them enabled without being really impeded in the game. But in civ6.. they ruin the game. It feels like I'm constantly at war. Barbarians are literally everywhere. My scouts are all dying because they'reI am to turn them off. And that makes some civs obsolete early game. That's poor core gameplay.Workers. Each worker can only be used a finite amount of times. 3 by default, and 4 with pyramids (which require desert).I understand this is because you have to pay more attention to which tiles you improve and which ones you don't. I get that. But now I have to make workers for each city.. multiple times.. that's a lot of turns. Wasted, just on making workers.Diplomacy. I have no ♥♥♥♥ing clue what I'm doing. The tutorial didn't tell me♥♥♥♥♥♥ and the UI is unhelpful. I seriously can't figure this out. (Though I didn't play past the medieval era due to frustrations, so it might've been more obvious later on.)The tutorial. It tells you too little. Much too little. The only things I learned from this tutorial was the basic stuff; which is good, and how to attack/kill a civ. It told me nothing about diplomacy, nothing about natural wonders, nothing about sea resources or how to improve them. Next to nothing about city states. I went through the tutorial and I still spent most of my time in the game being confused. In the end it just tells you to look at the civilopedia.In the end, I spent most of my time not understanding what I was doing. And that's after 4 hours of gameplay.I can't talk about anything past the first 100 turns. Because I never went any further than that. Right now the game is unplayable to me. There are too many small annoyances.But, there are good things. And I'll mention a few of those.You can link non-combat units with combat units so they move simultaneously. This is great, I only have to move the units once, and there's no room for ♥♥♥♥ups.The unit promotion system is way better. You can clearly see what path your unit can follow in terms of promotions, and when you promote the unit it also gets healed. No more being forced to get a healing promotion because your unit is dying.The fact that you have both a tech and civics tree, as well as the government policy system with cards. This allows for a very fine customization of playing style. This is great. (Though, this added complexicity might be confusing to some)The district system and other city building/planning mechanics. This makes you slightly less reliant on good spawn positions.There are more good things (and more bad things), but I can't think of them at this moment. Great overall game, but has some really glaring issues that could ruin the experience for you. I recommend waiting until this game has some patches. (don't you dare make fixes in gameplay a paid DLC, firaxis. You don't fix your own game and then ask money for it.)I recommend you don't buy this game in its current state. The game's too much of a downgrade to be worth the 60 buck price tag. I regret buying this. I'm sure it'll be a great game 2-3 years down the line, with expansions and fixes all there. But right now it's pretty frustrating."

Also does CIV5 feel by far more 'complete' (I guess this is a point which most players from CIV5 can agree).So, and what drives me now into writing this review? Let me explain it to you: I noticed that an expansion is coming and at first I was sure it is in my Deluxe Edition included - but now after checking the news, it is excluded from the 'Season Pass', so customer who bought the full edition or even the ridiculously expensive Anniversary Edition are now forced to buy that 30-dollars-DLC just to 'complete' their full game experience.It is really turning me mad, they screw around with the sports franchise (NBA and WWE - though I hate Wrestling) are nothing but hatred, XCOM 2 got an expensive DLC (War of the Chosen), Mafia 3 was a heavy disappointment in the eyes of fans of Mafia 2 and now they try to get as much milk as possible from their another big franchise cash-cow Civilization.In my humble opinion, I have no problems with boycotting 2K - in fact the most games in the last two years are ridiculous to their precursors. I will uninstall CIV 6 right now and hope that 2K will go bankrupt. I have the desire to write more insults but I have to stay strong, I just want good games and less greed for money.

As a PC player i feel a bit betrayed.Single player works fine - but multiplayer is just horrible. For our group of 5 people it sometimes takes an hour of setting up the game - ""error joining multiplayer session"" or outright crashing randomly.

Theological Combat is stupid. The AI is not anything resembling intelligent. Just today I was playing and two of my friendliest allies both decided to go to war with me without provokation. How does one's two closest allies both with friendly smiles on their faces suddenly become your most hated enemies?I'll tell you how, because they rushed this game to market and once published they moved on to other projects, when they should be spending more time fixing their mistakes, which is what good development houses do.Civilizations is not just a game, it's a significantly influential educational tool.

As a PC player i feel a bit betrayed.Single player works fine - but multiplayer is just horrible.

56,294.9,Not Recommended," December 6, 2017",6,"I'm propably the only old school Civ player writing a review, because I simply do not understand why this game gets such good reviews. I'm betting they are all pretty new to Civ.I've played Civilization for over 20 years, ever since the first game was released. I was hooked from the start. Civ 2, I loved it even more. Civ 3 was such an amazing development for the game and Civ 4 was simply the best! Then came Civ 5, wich never really felt like a compleate game. productivity was harder and the size of my army was never really the same. Plus the religion was in my opinion just a waste of production. Now after 300 hours of Civ 6, I must say: I am bitterly disapointed. The game has progressed little since Civ 5. Now I have even less production and everything feels like in slow motion. Religion has moslty been copy-paste from Civ 5. And the ai is terrible. The only online games I've played have all been over in the middle age at the latest.Gone are the big armies and world domination plots, instead we have endless turns of waiting for things to get built. The best way to get production, gold or science is to send emisaries to city states or through trade routes. Workers are now compleatly under your control and you must micromanage them the entire game. The only Civ that has any productivity are the germans and in my opinion the only usable civ.By the time you reach renaissance the game becomes just to much micromanage to enjoy a bigger picture game. And if ever your army gets viped, then you are done for. No chance to rebuild after a war. If you get ravaged by war then you can pack it in.The balance of Civ 4 is in the past, where you could chose from a variety of ways to play the game and have a multiple fun ways to win and losing a war and half your territories did not mean you were down and out. Now when I reach industrial age I just soldier through the turns and go for the space race victory. Anything else just takes to long, mostly because you have to micromanage everything the entire game.As big of a disapointment Civ 5 was for me, Civ 6 is even bigger. And how the ai can be worse and worse is beyond me.If you want to play a game of Civilization, buy Civ 4. I give Civ 4 a 10/10, Civ 6 I give 3/10 and that's only for the first three ages. There is absolutely nothing new and exciting to be found here, the introduction of districts was cool when I first played it but now I see it just adds on to the micromanage of the game which is to much of to begin with.Do not buy this, unless you like to spend alot of time micromanaging and planning the same thing over and over and over and over. And then if you do, try not to expand to much or the game will just start to feel like a job that you cant wait to finish.In Civ 4 I had empires with over 100 cities and I could reduce the micromange by automating units and cities. Now the thought of controlling 25 city's is a micromanage hell.I find it really sad that my favorite game for so many years has been reduced to this."

Barbarians may as well be NAZIS because they can and will ♥♥♥♥ you at every single opportunity.5. As many have noted, in-game diplomacy is a mythical concept.6. Poland is a stand-alone DLC for $5.7. A scenario is a stand-alone DLC for $5.8. The game went on sale for a whopping 10% over Christmas, which upsets me and I already own the game :/9. Kongo has a civ, and I don't say that to be racist; legitemately, who here had heard of Mvemba a Nzinga before this game?

All these bug fixes, and it still hasn't stopped them from being warmongering, religious zealots. Next, the game has yet to be cross compatible, leaving me to play the horribly flawed single player or Civ V instead. The game has been out for a little more than a year now, it's a shame. Finally, the DLC, which is the worst of all. 7 DLC civs that add up to a total of $32.95, not including tax? Absolutely ridiculous. Not to mention the balancing issues some of these civs have like Poland and Australia. Overall, Civ VI is a flop of a game and a bad addition to the Civilization franchise.

11,8.6,Not Recommended," September 22, 2017",6,"Overall, it's a decent game, if you want to spend $60 on it. Honestly though, it's very meh. One of the problems is that there's simply too much going on. I appreciate the depth and complextity Civ 6 brings to the table compared to the previous ones, but it frequently feels to cluttered. I would be ok with this except it feels too much like work and the payout isn't all that satisfying. As far as gameply, there are some mechanics that are questionable. For instance, after a certian point, fairly early into the game, you can move land units directly into the water and they have their own self-contained transport. It does make it substantially easier, but in that case whats the point of even having an ocean besides you can't build on it? On top of that, I have a bigger issue with the gameplay: It's too easy and doesnt feel at all interesting or satisfying. I played several times on the hardest mode and each time I was able to take over the world or at least get close before i won by other means. This may relate exclusivly to combat, but every time I took a city instead of feeling elated after a hard-fought campaign, I found myself thinking ""ugh what a waste of time."" All of the units feel pretty much the same, either they're meele or you can bombard a target from a few hexes away using an asthetically horrible red arrow, and the only thing that changes is hp, damage, and when you get to nukes(actually one of the better parts of the game). Finally, the graphics aren't bad per se, but the game is from 2016, not 2006. The graphics could stand to be improved, but the UI is a real weak point. Parts of it are clearly designed to be old-fashioned style but it would work better if it decided wheter to go that route or make it sleek and modern with intuitave controls. Last point- It takes ridiculously long to load or take a turn compared to previous Civ games. I have a pretty good laptop that can handle first-person shooters with ease, so this is likley on the developer's end.My point: Don't play it if you're looking for a quick game. Do get it if you want complex gameplay and dont care terribly much about graphics/UI or performance."

Part of the fun has somehow gone away, and I don't know exactly where it went. I hope the game will improve over time, and I will certainly check in with it again, but for now, I have no desire to continue playing. Every Civilization game I've played before (I-V) have been exciting and engaging, and it was very difficult to stop playing once started. Civilization VI does not entice me to come back for more, and that is a shame.By the way, it certainly doesn't help that the AI is weird and the UI is confusing."

The dev's should have stuck with what they have with Civ V and Beyond Earth and improved with more DLC's. I'm still waiting for a DLC for Civ V so that once you build your spaceship you can travel to other planets but I'm not holding my breath. Civ VI Not Happy."
119,25.7,Not Recommended," September 15, 2017",6,Developers to lazy to make an inteligent challenging AI and instead subliment it by giving them cheats and free units which means early game you get rushed and late game there is no challenge what so ever. 'War mounger' penatlties are ridiculous and diplomacy is boring and pointless. I like the new districts but why you can't replace or demolish districts is beyond me. overall id rather just play civ 5 with the dlc and not pay another full price for a♥♥♥♥♥♥reskin of the same game.

My friend also had issues with unit movement orders actually going through in game.Whilst I have been a lover of the Civ games in the past I cannot recommend this game and would say just stick to Civ 5."

29,335.1,Not Recommended," October 25, 2016",6,"BACKGROUND: Played CIV 2 as a child, loved it, and sunk probably 300 hours into it. Came back to the series way later with CIV 5 BNW, and mostly loved it, but still craved the chess like strategic feel of CIV 2. Super excited for CIV 6 and have played 40 hours on king and emperor difficulty games going for two different victory conditions. I have played only one other 4X game which is ENDLESS LEGEND which taught me a lot on how 4X can be different and awesome in so many ways (do play that).VERDICT: One step forward, and two steps backward, It frustrated me when developers don't just keep the good bits of previous iterations of games. There is a lot to like about the things they have added, and I mostly like the art style despite the negative reviews on here for that, but so much of it has been taken away and the balance is atrocioius.NEGATIVES:--UI-- Some of the changes have been nice, but it mostly is a huge step backward. In CIV 5 BNW, you could use the UI to understand the sytems and adjust strategy. For example, when you do a deal with a civ, you have no idea what it is if you want to check back. This history was there in CIV 5 BNW so why remove it. Further I hate the in city management mess. There are more buttons to click and it isn't very apparent initially how to manage amenities and what bonuses certain perks give (for example I can't check up on how a factory affects production in cities other than the one where I have produced it). Citizen management is just okay, but CIV 5 BNW was way better. They sacrificed usability to make it smaller on the screen and seemingy easier to do. Its so hard to track amenties from luxuries and know how many you have to trade, and the reports are horrible in comparison to CIV 5 BNW. There are so many things here that I can't quite remember, but the lack of info on many systems leaves me frustrated. And I hated how things overlapped other things. Shouldn't be hard to make better UI. Its the main interaction with the game, should be the first thing you work on in developing this type of 4X game.--Districts-- Following on from the above point, there should be an easy way to plan out a city and know the different advantages and whats coming in advance. A simple advisor who shows you what a city plan could be in the future would be great. And its so hard to know the exactly adjacency bonuses...--Civopedia-- Which brings me to the terrible civpedia which was pretty good in CIV 5 BNW, but not perfect. Now they made the stupid mistake of doing it over and in the process making it pretty and forgeting all the info people crave for when playing.--Diplomacy-- I like how you can see things about relationships, but mostly I hate the new diplomancy and was never a big fan to beging with. Endless legend has much clearer diplomacy, albeit much more basic. I wish this was the part they spent way more time with in CIV 6. I mean CIV 5 BNW had them talking for each interaction, now they are just silent mostly which is stupid. There were more options in CIV 5 BNW, but mostly I wished this was worked on more and expanded so your game involved a lot of pivoting and relationship management. I know the world congress they will bring in at some point, but the diplomacy does not seem fleshed out at all even though they have sold how smart it is with the agendas. Small point but I also hated the loading screens that you couldn't skip.--AI-- Still sucks. So easy fighting wars. Why can't they work on this!!!!!! Make it hard. The game difficulty shouldn't be about giving the AI perks or advantages, but having them smarted so they know the most efficient way to do things and have more awareness of the board to hurt you more. It just sucks.--Balance of cities-- The coastal and ocean tiles mostly suck now. I loved in CIV 5 you could add improvements that would add yield to the ocean tiles. Nothing here. So it makes no sense to have too many ocean tiles taken up by your city.--Balance of production-- Production has been reduced throghout which is fine but it did feel like it was way easier to grow a city than actually biuld things, and then I had to manage housing so I wasn't able to get on with the military side of the game as easily.--Great People-- I like how you compete for them great idea but the UI for it again sucks. I still felt the pursuit of great people in CIV 5 BNW gave much more bonuses and were more rewarding to work towards. I mostly forgot them in this game.--Wonders-- Seriously, if it takes up one whole tile they should be really powerful. Instead, all the wonders felt worse than CIV 5 BNW. I found only one or two really helpful, and then I mostly ignored them. The video is cool.--Controls-- No WASD?? Seriosly. And how bout a way to rotate screen like you guys do in XCOM 2? Would make the world so much more interesting if you can see it from different perspectives, and sometimes would help for those moments items are blocked from view because of the angle.--Strategic view-- Was so good in CIV 5 BNW i could play a whole game in that view only. Now it looks pretty but no adjustability in what I want to see. The lenses is there for what CIV 5 BNW had in terms of view options, but apart from religion they are useless. ARGHHHH.--Spies-- So weak whats the points. I get they have missions but there are so many options and they take so long I just didn't bother. Could be a great part of the game.--Amenities-- I get it and it makes much more sense, but it was so much fun to balance happiness as you grow your empire. It was clear and understandable, if not having so much real world sense. Again here I mentioned before I don't understand how my luxuries affect amenities, and I would like more control over distribution to perhaps buff up some cities at certain times.--Roads-- I get the caravan trade routes should make roads, but this was so frustrating. You should be able to plan roads another way, or they should be some more domestic trade options without the use of caravans as you can also plan roads.--Promotions-- The system looks better, but there should be clear paths to created distinct styles of units, and after the second tier almost always was useless. One was scale cliffs which I could never figure out how to use.There are more things I hated, but mostly it just didn't feel as cohesive a game as CIV 5 BNW. The middle turns are better for sure, but still it gets tedious moreover frustrating with lack of info.POSITIVES:--Districts-- I mostly love this, especially the harbor district which means you can create naval units even if you city is a few tiles inland. This is a great evolution.--Builders-- Great idea reduced the tedious clutter but i still found some suggestions not popping up and without the strategic view resources option in CIV 5 BNW was a little harder to know where things were to plan.--Civics tree/Government-- I thing this was mostly a good idea but I the cards should be perhaps a timed use so you keep changing your play style and plan when to do things and to reduce the clutter of so many cards. I would also love if they bought back the taxation/luxury/science system they had in CIV 2 in a more advanced way.--Performance-- Way better. Reduced loading times, quicker between turns and didn't crash once which CIV 5 BNW did a lot on my laptop with GTX 960M 2gb (all medium 1080p settings). Felt a lot better to play.--Domestic trade-- So glad the domestic trade doesn't reduce one city output and is just a bonus. Long overdue fix.--Religious units-- Loved how they fight with each other and have more fleshed out options and upgrades.There were probably more things I liked, but it goes to show this could be a great game if they address the above issues, and put more emphasis on improved AI, sensible and informative UI, intricate and thorough diplomacy systems, rotatable screen, and fleshed out options to streamline game options in the mid to late game."
61,122.6,Not Recommended," November 19, 2016",6,"Just like with vanilla Civ V back then, there's a lot to like in this iteration of Civ. While I find the unstacking of cities and the district sprawl a sharp contrast to the older games and the convoluted build requirements for some stuff requires active planning 5,000 years in advance, it actually succeeds in creating meaningful choices. The split tech trees and the religious combat add layers to the overall gameplay, and the limited pool of great people and the ability to buy them with either gold or faith works nicely via addition by substraction - no longer will you be able to have four great generals standing around by the late game.Unfortunately, every single good addition to the game, and the strong Civ V core that was carried over into VI, are completely unraveled by the horrible pace of the game, which is almost entirely down to the way in which movement has been changed in VI. Units can no longer move into terrain if they can not pay the required movement points in full, including river crossings. In addition to that, roads can not be built anymore (by most civs) except by running trade routes , which is only possible to other cities and thus greatly limits the ability to get a road down in a perhaps strategically important location, or by a special support military unit that won't pop up until the second half of the game, and even if you get those roads down, they will scarcely be of any use until late in the game. Coupled with the random map generator's tendency to create swaths of hill terrains, movement more often than not slows to a complete crawl, one tile per turn. And since stacking is for the most part not allowed, this means one unit per turn. In V, if your production cities are in the west and you are attacked in the east, a single road will pump your entire war machine over there in just a handful of turns. In VI, you're forked. Exploration, for me one of the most fun parts of any particular Civ game, becomes a chore, even with scouts.Unfortunately I don't see the core concept of movement to be able to be amended in patches / expansions, leaving it as the fatal flaw in a very good game."

Two ridiculous examples so far:1) In the Tutorial no less! I was frozen out and had to leave the game. Because the Tutorial insisted I build/select a Campus... but when doing so, I was rejected as there already was one. And there was no way out to avoid the selection. The only solution: end the game/Tutorial. This is quite incredible sine it is the Tutorial itself, built and managed by Firaxis.2) When playing an actual game something remarkably similar happened when I earned a Great Person. When I went to select which type it indicated that all of them had already been taken. Yet I could not escape or bypass the command to 'select a Great Person'. Result: I had to close/finish the game as the only way out of the black box.Firaxis: everyone expects there to be software flaws in a new release. But these kinds of cul-de-sacs have no such excuse."

This is NOT a triple A game. First Beyond Earth and now this monstrosity?Pro's:- more fun early game (no warmonger penalties in ancient era)- a few more interesting winning strategies (i.e; religious victory). But sadly this is not even remotely possible at higher difficulties as the unit spam is real- district system is fun. Expanding out the cities is a nice touch.cons:- Incredibly stupid AI. One game Brazil researched every single technology. I waited and once I researched battleship tech, I attacked. I was incredibly underteched but I still dominated the war due to their stupidity and blitherly around. You have every single tech for 50 turns and don't make any progress towards winning? No rockets, nothing, nada.- nonsensical social policies. The card system is just stupid and makes EVERY single game play the EXACT same. It makes the game so incredibly boring as leaders and civilization bonuses add very little to the game. Civ 5 idealogies and social policies added unique variation to EVERY single game. Civ 6 has this stupid cards system.- Dumb and boring mid and late game. Building districts in your cities is related to your tech level, making building new cities pointless. Want to wait 108 turns for your harbour to complete? So you add a billion trade routes to increase production to the city. It still is super pointless and feels really really boring.

561,30.1,Recommended," October 21, 2016",6,"8 Hours In-Game Impressions From a Civilization vet:- Almost everything is improved, from the ai being slightly better (still needs some work), the game has MUCh more content on launch than Civ 4, Beyond Earth and Civ 5 had during there launches, Sean beans voice is beautiful and a joy to hear, awesome new features (I LOVE the district addition!), The UI is maybe the best it has been and of course the game gives you that classic civilization feeling ""Just One More Turn!""- The things I feel like could be improved is the AI (I feel like its improved from the last game but still not on par with say stardock,etc..) and the art design (It is very bright, doesn't bother me as much as I expected but I def feel like I would have liked better art design) and it needs the ability to name you're cities! (Not sure why this was not included lol).Overall I am very impressed, not perfect but it is FULL of content and feels much more complete than civ 4 and civ 5 on release. With a few expansion packs this will, without a doubt be my favorite Civilization game ever (Civ 2 is my fav). Well done devs!I will comeback later for more thoughts when I put more hours in on the game, but so far I am impressed!

156,18.1,Not Recommended," August 5, 2017",6,"I love Civilization. This game is what pushed me towards my major in college. The units were varied, the leaders interesting, and it was all visible and searchable in the civilopedia. The gameplay made advancing through the eras one of its strong points. Smooth controls and easily understandable gameplay leading to advanced strategies led me to put 200 hours into Civ V.As it stands right now, I just barely broke 15 on Civ VI.The AI problem has been spoken about to great lengths and others can probably put it more eloquently than I. I'll leave it to them to outline why you should most likely avoid that reason. Progression of districts was an interesting concept that could have been something great, but implementation feels sloppy. There are a lot of finality to their placement and having wonders take up tiles as well leads to even the best laid plans to become haphazard cacophanies of scattered districts that will inevitably be sacked by every leader that hates you for so much as batting an eye at a city-state.My biggest problem, and one I don't see very often in the comments though, is that the civilopedia is practically barren. They stripped out almost all the history in favor for gameplay reasons. Each entry is a paragraph at most. Civ V gave an in depth analysis of each units history, uses, and conflicts surrounding them while still having an easy to find section dedicated to its gameplay value. Civ VI casts the Civ part out the window in this one and that to me shows how rushed this game was. They couldn't even be bothered to flesh out the history in this history based game.Tl;dr - Game is lacking in district placement, AI, and history. Not worth $60 as it is right now. Just buy Civ V."
506,10.0,Not Recommended," September 11, 2017",6,"Civilization 6 is a downgrade from other works in the Civilization series. It is less playable, more awkward, and even less politically gutsy than greats in the series like civilization 4.1. Playability: The game is hard to navigate around the map. World view? Don't even think about it. You can only zoom out just a little bit. The standard view on other civ games is the farthest zoom out in this civ. Late in the game is very tedius because of this. In fact all parts of the game are more tedius.2. Awkwardness: Don't even think you are going to be able to place roads where you want them. They are placed automatically by trade units only when you trade with other cities (or when you use a late game military unit). Also construction units can only build 2 or 3 times and then die. There is no automated construction feature....it's like the ui went back to civ 1 in this aspect. Also, because of imbalance and poor design, you will have many great writers, musicians, and artists just sitting around for thousands of years, because they are only useful if you have MANY very specific districts built (that can house only 1 apiece).3. Less politically gutsy: In Civilization 4, they modeled slavery into the game, for bonus in construction! Forget about anything like that this time. In fact, you can tell how politically correct this game is, just by the intro. The woman from the intro nags you constantly the entire game. It's worse than having my wife programmed into the game. I bet there is a way to turn her off, but I am talking about defaults.Don't buy this one. Wait until civ 7.....hopefully it will be better."

There are certainly some problems, some frustrations and some things just plain lacking. I don't disagree with any other those complaints. Likewise, there are some really cool features in the game that a worth experiencing for yourself.I find it a hard line to draw between those things that just don't work as I assume they were intended, and those things that are just different from what I'm used to in Civ 5 and I haven't learned to take advantage of yet.What I'd like to differentiate from all those negative reviews is that I would still recommend this game. There is some fun to be had, and I've enjoyed most of the play time I've spent in-game. Maybe hold off and see what the first major patch brings, but I don't see any reason why someone couldn't buy the game now and enjoy it.Fall Patch Update:Some improvements in some areas, but AI is still lacking.

341,0.9,Not Recommended," March 16, 2017",98,"Product received for freeI don't know how to review the final nail in a coffin for a company.I recieved this free when I purchased a video card, mostly I let my dad play it- he mysteriously stopped a day or two in and for the last couple months its sat in my library, unplayed. Myself curious as to why that was. You see, my father has been playing civ since year 1. He introduced my brother & myself to civ. I once had a settler win an engagement with a bomber in Civ 1 (am-i-right?). Anyways, my point is he doesn't stop playing 'one-more-turn' simulator for no apparent reason- as it might be said at a lan party as a means of reverse psycology when certain memebers claim they're too tired to go on; 'Mr. Penney doesn't ♥♥♥♥♥ out on an all nighter of civ'- which isn't exacltly true. He doesn't play Multiplayer & I've never seen him play civ past 5 am. Unlike myself, whos gone at least 24 hours once or twice- smoke breaks included but I digress...I've watched the franchise evolve since I was a kid, I hated some things and learned love most. But this, honestly I've only gotten to turn 80 and I totally want to uninstall it and go vomit a bit. I'm simultaniously playing a game of Civ 5 Brave New World with a friend right now- besides the onslaught of barbarians it's a lot more enjoyable.""I'm having so much fun having 3 new game mechanic menus being thrown at me that have almost no relevence as I continously have to rework everything inside of them every 8 turns."" -Me, with the utmost sarcasim on turn 36.Honestly if you love civ and are unsure, take what I just said with a grain of salt. Theres tons of interesting avenues to unit progression and city progression in this new game. But personally I'm finding everything quite overwhelming right off the gate- with 'new to civ 6' hints that dont seem to be even noticable in contrast to the 'in-your-face' tutorial approach with the previous title. It's cool to see a game from '91 get a 6th reboot I guess, but then again this products been presented in several 'ripped off' forms that might be more enjoyable all over steam.I feel this is just not a good replacemenmt to Civ 5 + BNW., its a fun game and I'm not saying this particular title is bad; just not better then its predicesor, which is what it makes me want to play more immedietly."
38,61.4,Not Recommended," April 4, 2017",9,"This game is a massive dissapointment and is in a pretty much unfinished state at the moment. I've played the series since Civ 4, and this one is probably the worst. However it does get regular updates, so if things do change i may change my mind. I dont normally post rant type reviews but this is an exeption.Pros- Nice graphics- Runs pretty well, even on my 5 yr old slow as ♥♥♥♥ mac- Some nice new additions, like districts and a political system- Regular updates- DLC. Although its overpriced, the actual content is good.- Genuinely nothing else i can think of to add to this list...Cons- Although there are regular updates, the game is still ♥♥♥♥ing broken and all the big problems are just ignored. For example cross platform multiplayer is completely broken, and even though the devs have said they are working on this, they been saying this since release and nothings happened.- Diplomacy is broken. Literally the AI will declare war on you for no reason, even if you are playing on a huge size map and they're on the other side of the globe and have absolutely nothing to gain, and also if they can't even win. They will also denounce you for no apparant reason and give no explaination, and literally no one will be your freind. Your worst enemies will also ask you politely if they can have access to all your resources even though they know you won't accept.- Districts and tech trees although they are a nice addition are really complicated and hard to get to grips with.- As i said before, you're buying an unfinished game if you chose to purchase it. For example, im pretty sure they were planing to have more than one leader per civ, Greece has two different leaders to choose from, however this is the only civ currently with this feature, and there are a load of hints that suggest that the devs were planning to add this to more civs, although havent for some reason. Some unique units for example are only unique to their leader and not their civ.- Poor choice of civs. I can't seem to find a single civ i enjoy playing, even the ones that i played in Civ 5, this is just a personal opinion though.- Poor mac support. I get most users are not on mac, but seriously not having a working cross platform multiplayer almost 6 months after release is just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, and the fact that DLC are released for mac over a week after they are on other platforms.- Loads of minor bugs. Water sources for rivers for example, dont actually count as a fresh water source, which is incredibly annoying considering that water is vital for building a city.- The game is just ♥♥♥♥ing boring and ragey. The whole pace of it seems far too slow, even on quick speed, and you'll either be wandering round the map for ages trying to find people, or be attacked by about 5 civs at once, and if you fight back you get denounced for warmongering. This is partly what makes it so boring, the fact that every ♥♥♥♥ing game is exactly the same, you spawn in, wander around, get moderatly sucessful before you either get invaded or quit out of boredom.- Finally, DLC and digital deluxe edition (again). I didnt buy deluxe edition but i feel sorry for anyone who did because they've been absolutely ripped off. Deluxe edition was meant to save you money on DLC by giving you the first 4 free. However the first dlc have turned out to be £4 nation packs with a scenario and sometimes a natural wonder or two, with the exeption of the latest DLC which is just two of these merged into one. If you dont intend on playing these nations, which many people don't, they literally add ♥♥♥♥ all to the game and are just a waste of money. I was expecting actual expansions like BnW and Gods and Kings in Civ 5 to be included in deluxe. Having said that, if you are going to play these nations then the DLC are totally worth it.- oh, and its ♥♥♥♥ing £50"

39,35.3,Not Recommended," December 22, 2017",9,"The district mechanic for instance is ridiculous. On a standard sized earth map the entirety of Japan is represented by about 6 or 7 tiles. Because of this game's terrible ""district"" system, that's not even enough for 1 functional city and yet the real life japan is the size of the entire American eastern coastline. So essentially these districts are supposed to be occupying the same space as the entire island of Kyushu, roughly the size of the state of West Virginia or Republican Ireland. The district system heavily favors continental powers and puts coastal/naval/island empires at a massive disadvantage. Culture or Science victories on an islands map? Only if you like to starve your population and have next to no production at all! Many of these districts also completely do away with any passive resource yields for the tiles they sit on. Want culture or science? Well say ""sayonara"" to productivity, food, and gold! Absolutely ridiculous.And don't even get me started on the AI! Yes, real life nation-states have been incredibly capricious throughout the millennia, but they at least give you some warning!!! Hitler swore he would reestablish the German Reich before occupying Poland; the only people he surprised were timid idiots like Chamberlain and Charles de Gaul. Instead Civ 6's AI has what is called a chaos value. Basically, the AI does things which don't make any sense sometimes which could be an interesting feature but firaxis just lazily made it so that your friends can backstab you at the drop of a hat. Civs which you aren't competing with in any way and who are on the opposite side of the map which will take eons to sail to will randomly go to war with you completely out of the blue. No indications at all! No troops amassing at your border, no ships cloaked beneath the fog of war just off your coastline. NOTHING! Absolutely infuriating!Worse yet, the new ""agenda"" system is broken. The devs lazily made it so that the AI overweights your opponent civs' agendas. So instead of Cleopatra seeing your powerful navy and generous trade agreements with her, she has this ridiculous laser-focus on your army, land units only. This is not realpolitik in the slightest and its far sloppier than Civ 5's AI. Modders also have no way to modify the AI itself. They're stuck reverse engineering (i.e. guessing) how the AI works and manipulating the information the AI has access to. The AI cheats like nobody's business as well. Ingenious plays like pushing an expansionist opponent into expanding into desert areas fail because AI opponents have access to unlimited resources."

The new city districts system is a whole new level of management and I could not imagine playing Civ without it again. The music, art style, and leader animations all bring this alternate history to life in new and exciting ways.Now, time for the elephant in the room. The AI can act very wonky. They are unpredictable and will do whatever they please regardless of their friendship status with you. I had Rome, my game long ally and friend, declare war on me when I completely outmatched them. Their whole civilization gone because they decided they wanted some bananas. I just wish it would take more into consideration before making a game changing decision like that. Not to mention how their agendas tend to make them act like entitled brats very quickly. Agendas should add to the complexity of diplomacy rather than dictate tantrums because I have one more luxury resource than them.However, considering this is the most launch content any Civ game has ever had, I'm very hopeful these will be ironed out over time. I am so excited to see what the future holds considering we already have what Civ V's major expansions were (no World Congress though). All in all, the game is still extremely addicting and fun to play. It can only get better from here, and they are off to an outstanding start! Now excuse me as I go take one more turn."

I was very dissapointed at launch when I bought this game and encountered numerous bugs, no steam workshop, and worst of all, horrifying AI. I mean really, the AI were, and still are, god awful. In basically every game I played at least one AI had declared war on me around 30 turns in because of their ""agenda"" or some other obnoxious reason. The diplomacy is also lame and tedious. There are also STILL some gamebreaking bugs lingering and resurfacing in games I have tried to play. For example, at one point in a game, England had declared war on me while we were friends, and it never showed her declaring war. So when my alleged friendly civ waltzed up to my capital with troops and started attacking while it still showed her as a friend in the diplomacy bar, you can imagine I was a little confused. I was never able to negotiate peace because of this.If you have Civ V and/or other civ games and are considering getting this, save your money. It's a downgrade. If you are looking to buy this and have never played Civ before, either get Civ V for reduced price or wait until this game is AT LEAST 30 dollars.

The cities look great & the graphics are easy on the eyes. I loved finding new & amazing natural wonders too.Having said that, there are some things that really get on my goat, you can't name your cities??? What were they thinking? You do not seem to be able to put your units in sentry mode, it is fortify or skip (& sometimes there is no skip even???). You can not use auto end turn, or it runs out of control with no way to stop it, the game even ran in the background playing whilst I tried to change the setting back!!! Even clicking on wake unit only seem to work if you could do it in the nano second of your turn, the same for trying to move a unit. Barbarian camps appear with no notice, & the screen does not jump to their location if they appear... nor if any inter your space, or move out of the FOW; so every turn I have to search my large border looking for a brown camp on a brown map (I often couldnt see them if they were on a resourse on forrest or jungle). You can not put your units into an extended move, or they run right past the bad guys, you need to move just the alotment of each turns movement, or they miss their target. I can not bump the edge of the screen to scroll up, it will work left, right & down. The auto explore had my scouts taking a step left, then one right for 25 turns... so I was actually left feeling tired of micro-managing & interupted by having to end every turn manually & move every unit 1 tile at a time... so 100% for polish, but 30% for actual game play.

Had to hunt down barbarians for my first 50 or so turns, and someone declared war on me after the 30th turn (seriously, he only had 2 archers, why tho). As soon as you start winning the ""war"" (i.e killing both of his troops) it instatly starts spamming trades in order to negotiate peace, and gives up all it's resources.Bad interface. I was a really big fan of the Civ V interface, where everything looked more.. Clear, per se. I think the production menu looks horrible, you don't really get a sense of what anything is, unlike in Civ V, where you could actually see what you where developing. That might just be a minor issue for me though.Last but not least, the graphics. I just can't get over that it looks like a mobile game. It just doesn't feel immersive to me. Some people like it, I hate it.TL;DR: Bad AI, terrible user interface, graphics looks like it was developed for iPhone back in 2013.

At launch, the game's meta rewards all-out domination in almost every situation with some civics (like one that creates horse units 100% faster) being incredibly over-powered. There is a lot to like, but huge balance issues and really aggressive AI with ""personalities"" that are illogical and silly like a civilization hating you because you don't have a large navy or because you aren't evil to city-states so it is incredbily easy to manipulate the AI to become an ally or to provoke them into a war (and defense still has an advantage so counter-punching is still very effective). Finally, they still have the AI for higher levels of difficulty just get ""cheats"" - basically the AI gets bonus resources that players don't get but what would have been nice is if they'd taught the AI player strategies and made it actually smarter instead of just letting it cheat."

It was a fun way to spread your city across the map, making elements of your infrastructure more vulnerable to enemy attacks, and vice versa. The culture update was really great, I loved culture being split off from the technology track. The new way governments work made that system feel way more useful than Civ V.This game has its flaws, but on the whole, I thought it was a good entry into the franchise. It tired a lot of innovative stuff, unlike Beyond Earth which was just a Civ V skin."

That said, sadly I cannot recommend this game at the moment.Graphics- So, okay, Civ V had some amazing graphics I thought for its age, as they were made to look realistic down to the buildings, units and improvements. Then they released Civ VI and I was just like WTF happened, its almost a step back I think as everything looks cartoony and units are only a standard 4 per? This makes no sence to me and is one of my big pet peeves with the game at the moment.AI - Civ V AI could sometimes even predict you after all the expansions came out to bolster them, but once again it seems like we have taken a step back, even the BASE Civ 5 AI was better then this. One word pretty much explains how they seem to act, illogical.Tech tree - Little to no info on it and progression seems just kind of, Blah, now.All in all I think the game had some great intentions behind it but it falls short by a mile of the standard of game I expect from Sid Meier now a days, I mean even Beyond Earth is better then this at the moment and that should of been DLC, not a standalone game since it was just reskined. In hindsight I would not buy this and would continue playing Civ 5 with or without mods.Thanks for reading, hope this helps."

71,199.2,Recommended," November 28, 2017",65,"Civilzation VI was one of those games that I absolutely did not care about, or at least did not understand the hype, when it was first announced. I had not played Civilization V, nor had I followed the series. I knew that it was a strategy game- and so disliked it. However, a few months previously, I had bought Stellaris, and so grand strategy games were slowly flying into my radar, including Civilization V.Then, ManyATrueNerd started a Let's Play on Civilization VI. Suddenly, the game was the only thing on my mind. It was one of those scenarios where when I wasn't doing anything else, Civilization VI took up my spare head room. Gameplay scenarios and diplomacy screens and beginning screens in the game dominated my brain. When it finally came out, without thinking, I purchased the Deluxe Edition (kind of a let down, as the added civs since release weren't all that special- cool, but in relation to being DLC? Eh).Very quickly, Civilization VI became my most-played game on Steam (until I got into Paladins), and even more so dominated my mind. I will explain the reasons.Pros:-A very easily addictive game, Civilization is the origin of the term ""just one more turn"", and its addictivity is self-explanatory-The music is great (after about sixty hours I turned it off to listen to my own, though)-Most of my other points fall under the first point-The design choices that Firaxis made when deciding upon the new art style? MMM, daddyCons:-Most certainly religion. Even with the new rebuild of the system. Another civ began next to you, and happens to have a religion? Yeah, goodluck even struggling to keep your own cities worshipping your own religion. Any nearby religion will immediately bum-rush you, not even taking into account the fact that you are currently converting their cities. And it never ends; say you make a gigantic push into their territory, and convert five of their seven cities? Aw, too bad, they had seventy inquisitors just around the corner.-Diplomacy, obviously. Not only do enemy AIs completely ignore anything that you ask of them, including ""Pretty please, could you, like, STOP CONVERTING MY FU***ING CITIES"", but they also get angry as all hell if you ever do the same to them. You wanted to settle in a certain location, (this is especially applicable to the early game) and did so, but then the Kongo denounces you for settling to close? Oh, hey, one of their cities was shrouded in the fog of war. Whoops. You settled somewhere, then two turns later Germany settles right next to you? Oh, well, darn, guess Germany hates you now.Obviously, diplomacy is the largest issue with this game.Now, while it might seem as though I riffed on the cons for longer, its only because I feel very strongly about them, and so remember them that much more clearly. But really, isn't that the case for most things? We remember the bad with much more intense emotions than we do the positive, and that is heavily reflected in this review. But I know for a fact that I love this game dearly. Definitely check it out if you like 4X games, but admittedly probably hold off if you were really into Civilization V at the end of its development cycle."
106,114.0,Not Recommended," November 2, 2016",106,"The entire game just feels completely unbalanced in nearly every aspect compared to Civ 5. While Civ 5 had a tech/building path that progressed in a way that made since from ancient to future era, the split between some buildings and wonders being in the research tree and half in the civics tree really screws up the balance.Its nearly impossible to be in the same era in both, and while this does change up how tech progressing is in the game, its not in a good way. Every victory path seems literally not fleshed out in a logical, or balanced manner.Science requires exceptional amounts of production end game, which is fine and not the worst of the win conditions in terms of balance.Religious victory requires every civ to follow your religion. Which is completely do-able, as in general, faith is really easy to amass in Civ 6, but this victory is rather straight forward as Apostle units can combat each other and act like inquistors when used on religious cities.Culture is extremely easy on all singleplayer game-modes as in general, the AI is terrible at any district based victories. Furthermore, there is legitimely not enough great works of writing slots in the entire tech tree for a decent number of great writers which seems absolutely insane. I had to literally expand and plop down a theatre and ampitheatre district for 1 great work of writing slot. Furthermore, they removed the themeing on great works of writing. Culture focus always makes you incredibly ahead on the civics tree which on singleplayer lets you get nearly every wonder you want in that tech tree. Theres no real counterplay to stopping civics victory of other players except to conquer them i believe.Domination. Straight forward, but with the new encampments and movement system, war weariness and etc. War sucks. Its insanely hard to take cities and virtually impossible against a competent oppenent unless you get extreme tech timings on them. Factor in the insane encampment positions terrain can allow and hill visions and you got a recipe for failure on this win condition. Unless your versus AI, as they are still horribly inept at strategy beside spamming units.--the most notable addition in warfare however is the new support units which are an amazing thought, but only really come into effect in the modern era, which is dissapointing, plus the complete lack of hammers it feels you have regardless of how good a city is.In all, i feel like Civ 6 just put in a bunch of new features without playtesting them enough to make the balance needed for a Turn-Based Strategy Game, especially when compared to its predecessors. Great People are in general useless and gimmicky, as a few can be really strong, but in general most have very limited effects. Districts are amazing ideas put into terrible action as in general the balance of how much hammers/research/culture techs/buildings/units need seem horribly off. Cities never seem in a ""GOOD"" position, even if you have amazing tiles, amazing district placement, and tons of trade routes. I feel like its just a result of really bad balancing on the part of the game designers.Furthermore, in previous civ games i was only ahead in time historically by a few hundred years at max. IE like 1400 and im in the modern era in a Civ 5 game. But in civ 6, i am literally always ahead by at least that much time, even WITHOUT building a single campus. Its insane. The lack of playtest and balance is just horrible, and i just hope they polish it up so it can actually be a good successor to Civ 5"

They are banking on Civ fans buying this game with little regard to the mediocre design, particularly the AI-don’t succumb, it is not worth your time/money. Play Civ 5 with some of the awesome mods for a better, more polished experience.I have never written a game review, but after the debacle of Beyond Earth I’m hoping to save other fans of Firaxis/Civ games the money with regard to this game.This does not feel like an evolution of previous Civ games, this feels like the designers asked themselves “how can we make it different from Civ 5?” not “how can we make it better?” Some of the changes are well done, including traders constructing roads, the “card” system for government…and that’s about it. The districts are a nice idea, but really feels like an artificial road block, rather than a realistic gameplay element—how about a limited number of buildings in the city before I have to construct a district? The graphics change seems unnecessary and I have read other reviewers complaining about slow turn speed, which I have also experienced, whether or not that is because of graphics or the horrible AI, I can’t say, but the end result is the same, a game the feels clunky and slow even in the early going with few units/areas revealed. Also it was much easier to get a sense of where and what was happening on the map in Civ 5.The most glaring reason not to purchase this game is the awful, horrible, stupid AI. I played a few games for a brief number turns before starting a huge map on Emperor Difficulty with the intention of playing to the end. Despite a huge map there is very little viable land not in close proximity to other city-states or Civs, indeed I managed to found two cities before Spain founded a city immediately next to my capital. Spain’s main empire was about 20 tiles away. So I decided to attack this city with what I thought was a modest size army, 2 hoplites, 1 battering ram and 2 horses. I steamrolled this city as it was isolated and had no reinforcements as I expected. What I did not expect was to take every city Spain had on the map (4 remaining), as they had little to no army and what they did have was poorly managed. I can’t image this is an isolated incident; they had developed their cities but no military. My next nearest neighbor had done the same thing essentially waiting for me to steamroll them as well. It’s clear as in initial releases of previous CIV iterations the AI has no idea how to wage war, and now it apparently has no idea how to balance the development of cities vs. military. So now I am already bored, I’m in first place by score and I suspect I could steamroll my next neighboring city, but given the low turn speed it sounds like the only challenge will be keeping my patience as the turn counter spins."

Balance is meh, tool tips for practically everything are missing (even alert popups, when I mouse over most it just tells me the tile behind the alert), map navigation is a pain and about 100 different events snap your camera to your cities forcing you to start over with the move.Watch for a major update / patch and re-think buying then if you can find some fresh reviews. Right now this feels like a pixar movie, ported to tablet, ported to PC. It's fairly pretty, music is par for the Civ experience, gameplay is a train wreck. Most of my frustration probably revolves around a really clumsy UI that makes it SUPER easy to do incredibly stupid things with your support troops. Like, I just spent 2 hours in a war trying to get an admiral to stay attached to a fleet. Because there's a button for that, now, but damned if I could get it to actually work. They'd move together for maybe one whole turn then the admiral would decouple and start walking across the warzone on foot. Stuff like that.. the game just isn't done. I'd say the game is just about ready to demo at E3."

First, sequels are different. If it was the same, we'd just keep playing Civ V. Second, the art style is a matter of taste. I personally love it.Now, if you're still on the fence, go back and read about Civ V when it first came out. People declared Civ IV as the Alpha and Omega of all strategy games and Civ V was a diseased mongrel that just soiled your grandma's rug. Now, Civ V is the golden child and Civ VI has the AUDACITY to try new things. I think you can see how 99% of the complaints are by people who were never going to like Civ VI out of the gate.Finally, remember that satisfied players are out PLAYING. We're not on the forums complaining because that's time that could be spent crushing the AI. Is Civ VI perfect? No. Is it crucially flawed? No. A small number of people have technical issues that are unfortunate but are part and parcel of PC gaming. Games not working sometimes, that's a risk we all accept due to the inherent difficulty in programming for the PC platform vs. consoles with standardized hardware.Now, if you're new to the series, this is a very welcoming entry. On lower difficulties, the AI is a declawed house cat. Come to think of it, on higher difficulties you're still kinda playing against yourself. The AI gets more aggressive but they're still tactically feeble in combat.Should you buy it? Absolutely. It has everything you could want from a 4X game and no matter what anyone else says, the Civ series is still the 800-lb. gorilla in the room compared to everything else."

And I am not just talking about the crashes which some users have.But basic things such as:Num keys don't work to move units. (You have to use the mouse to move units).There is no sentry(Wait until you see an enemy) function.If a unit is set on an auto path to a target, and an enemy unit block the path, the system will just calculate an other path and take it, sometimes sending the unit the other way around some mountions.It's really difficult to stop/cancel a units auto move.When you lose, the game just tell you that you lost. But not why you lost. Just ""Sorry, you lost"".The diplomatic system don't work. You can have positive relations with an other civ for 50 turns. And then they suddently attack you for no reason.Sometimes civilizations far away which you don't share border with, just declare war. Since you are so far away, they newer send any units, and after about 30 they just ask for peace without you ever seeing any of their units.The highlight content under the mouse pointer don't work. If you move the screen content without moving the mouse pointer(Such as using the scrollwheel in a menu, or moving the map with the cursor keys). the selected content under the mouse don't update. So even if the mouse pointer hover over new content, the old content is still selected. This causes quite some missed move(Especially since you have to use the mouse to move units).There is no sdk. So currently no mod support.And the spy system. DOh the spy system. Very interesting but you have to give all your spies the exactly same order every 3 turns.

134,8.0,Not Recommended," January 11, 2017",4,"Coming from someone who loved Civ 5, I really hate the changes they added to this game. I hate how housing works, you basically need to get builders, which only have 3 charges... to upgrade tiles so your city can grow more (only .5 per upgrade ). You can imagine how frustrating it can be when barbs destroy it. I think the idea of districts is cool but in the end more annoying than anything. You just have to be really smart with placements. Wonders seem to be a joke for the most part in this game compared to Civ 5, some of them are utterly useless, but they look cool when you build them. Policies just suck now, there are a few powerful ones but most are situational for like building a boat or +5 gold with a trade route on a Wednesday while there is a full moon out.This game cant even touch civ 5 with all dlc <3, this game was just SOOOO HARD to play I had to force myself."

Getting Civ V Complete (for as low as 7 dollars) is a much more complete experience than paying full price for this. It's not even worth it at half price.Also, bring back war themes. War themes fill you with either determination to wipe another civilization off the face of the earth, or instill you with fear depending on what side of the battle you are on. War themes being gone saddened me more than I could imagine. Example of wartheme:Multiplayer still seems to be bugged. Disconnects and desyncs happen seldomly, but not as much as Civ V which was very unstable. It's performance is improved from Civ V, however.In a nutshell, wait until this game gets more content."

72,24.4,Not Recommended, February 11,4,"As a long-time fan of the Civ series, I can say that this a solid game. I won't fill this review with long explanations of the differences between VI and other Civ games... or with listing pros and cons. Rather, I'm just going to say that the entire experience is ruined by the unacceptable amount of time that the game takes to calculate each. Especially in the late game, even with animations turned off, the game takes 20 seconds, 30 seconds, 45 seconds, or even a full minute to calculate each turn. For this day and age, for a AAA game released from a major studi, this delay is unreasonable and shocking. I would expect each turn to take a few seconds at most.... a full minute is madness and ruins the experience. I can't take it... I'd refund if I could."
84,155.0,Recommended," October 22, 2016",4,"Unlike most of the games I get hyped for, this game completley met my expectations and much more. The developers really expanding the basics of the game like city building and structure and government structure, while only tweaking the parts of the game that were 'good' or 'okay'. Not only does it add many new things to the series, but Civilization VI is full of little things that will make you smile (Things like the music). Honestly makes Civilization V look like an unfinished, basic game. There are really no major cons of the game. If you like empire building and managing games and/or do not have the attention span to read any more reviews, empty your wallet on this beauty."
50,29.3,Recommended," October 27, 2016",4,"Product received for freeI don't write many reviews on steam but being a well seasoned Civ player I decided to do this for once.Positives:- New Styled Graphics; the cartoony goofy graphics provides a fresh new start to Civ, unlike Civ Beyond Earth, which gave new graphics but went the wrong direction. Although it will be a shock for Civ 5 players, and will take a while to adjust, it will nevertheless bring nostalgic memories to older Civ players.- Gameplay change; unlike Civ 5, this game will bring a larger focus on city building, letting you decide what you would mould your empire to become; cultural, militaristic or religious? Unlike previous installments, where the city with the biggest production produces everything, you have to more carefully decide what ""district"" you will build.Negatives:-Diplomacy; AI is still ♥♥♥♥ed, and declares war every century. Even Gandhi seem to be the most warmongering on the game from what I have seen (although this is the case for every Civ game for some reason) but I still hope this will be patched.-Borders; Just a small tweak but the borders are hard to differenciate from each other. A simple coloured line marks your territory. I played a game as China vs Japan and I could hardly tell the difference between our cities and empires. This is maybe because I am used to all territory to have a colour but I believe I will adjust to this.-Warfare: Although focus has been taking on infrastructure I can't help but notice that the quality of warfare has been dropped. Not only are enemies practically unconquerable until you get the Artillery unit but they also seem to be spamming units that provide buffer making it impossible to reach their cities. This again might be the AI's fault but I still appreciate they added new support units like Medic and Engineer. I also like the idea of combining units to form corps and armies, even though combining them does not provide double the damage which one might think.Conclusion:Overall this game provides a relief from Beyond Earth, and with some few patches on the AI this game will be a genuin success to the franchise."
39,"1,081.7",Not Recommended," November 5, 2016",4,"I have played Civilization since the 90's and loved every version, this version has some great ideas.You can research two items at once. You can fight religious conversion without going to war.However the interface is horrible as in,Often difficult to get a unit to move where you want, or be able to fire on another unit, it let's you try and try then suddenly will move your artillary to a location near the target so it will be killed on the next turn.I have to play in windows mode or my mouse pointer isn't visible, this puts the standard close game X on the upper right corner just above where they often put their close dialog window X I have closed the game 3 time due to this 'feature'.The custom game settings cannot be saved so if you want anything other than the standard setup you have to go through and pick each of your setting every time you start a game. Tedious and frustrating.The Options menu is vague at best, I tire of the videos shown each time an opponent talks to you but they didn't put an obvious don't show the video selection you have to reduce performance to eliminate this. (who knows if this also cuts out something I may want.)Others have covered the AI, so I won't go there, I don't know if it's any worse than Civ 5 but it certainly isn't any better. The graphics are much worse than 5 more like something from Civ 3. When moving a settler or religious person the graphics go from poor to horrible and you often can't see any details of what is on the map.Others seem confident the game will be fixed but I don't hold out the same hope, it doesn't seem to me they did any proof testing prior to the release so this version is probably just a money grab. They know it will be a best seller so they ddin't put any effort into the game. It is too bad as there was someone there who had some good ideas for improving the game but the execution is mediocre to horrible."

Not to meantion a serious lack of balancing and too much emphasis on military victory. I love the cultural development and how its separate to science allowing you to create a cultural utopia of cavemen. Perhaps they could have done religious development like this too? Purchasing units with faith seems to be out of place when compared to culture tech trees and the cards system. I like the idea of districts and having focused cities but REALLY? we have to use the city production to build it? It seems like the districts should form on their own at certain populations and be next to the city centre. Anyway enough rambling. The game feels like if you were to download 10 different overhaul mods and use them all at once. Many conflicts and focuses that create a cluster cluck. The Civs in the game are interesting but there's not nearly enough of them.As of a month ago the game simply wont run, Tried multiple fixes which didnt work. I feel i have spent more time trying to get the game working than actually playing the game.In sumary the game isn't bad or anything its just not as good as the other Civ games I have played.

I've loved Civilization sice the first generation, but one week into this new adventure and I'm already bored.The problem as I see it is that Firaxis is not learning from their own history. Civ V vanilla came out and it was unbalanced, buggy, lacked depth... all in all, not nearly as good as Civ IV plus the expansions. And guess what, the same thing has happened in CIV VI. It took two expansions for Civ V to become a good game and several mods for it to become a great game. So why didn't they learn their lesson from their own previous expansions? Similarly, why didn't they incorporate elements from the most successful mods into their new game? They ignore their fan base, they don't test their games, they give us half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥released... this was a money grab pure and simple.I see a lot of people saying ""wait for the expansion"" or ""don't worry, a mod will fix that"" -- shouldn't the onus be on Firaxis to release a full gaming experience? Furthermore, why are we depending on UNPAID modders to fix the problems of an expensive triple-A game title? For $60 I expect a fairly high-end (polished) game. Civ V changed a lot of things from the previous version, so I can somewhat understand why it wasn't 100% on release... but Civ VI just feels like a really dull version of Civ V. The removed a bunch of the depth that made Civ V great and only gave us a couple of game mechanics that seem like good ideas on paper but don't currently work together to increase the levels of enjoyment in the game itself.The game play is unbalanced, the graphics are a HUGE step backwards (looks like some freemium mobile game), the AI managed to get worse, the civs are boring, diplomacy is useless, religion is annoying... and basically it feels like they've nerfed most of the things that made Civ V so great.""Wait for the expansions"" how about wait for the bargain bin because right now this game is nowhere near where Civ V left off."

I have been a huge fan of the series since its inception, and this game really feels more like it was created as a mobile version than a full PC release. Graphically, the game has taken huge steps backwards, opting for a highly-saturated cartoon aesthetic than the realism that such a game really demands. In many ways, the game feels incomplete and most of the newly implemented mechanics (the government card systems, expiring workers, and AI players as a whole) really make the game feel less intuitive and effective than previous entries.I was expecting a game that built and improved upon the innovations from Civilization IV, V and Beyond Earth, yet this game has completely disposed of that feeling.Overall Synopsis: Very disappointed.

Some might consider it's style ""Childish"" and ""Casual mobile"" but it looks well made in that regard and has a number of little animations like spinning Watermills, doves over your Holy Sites and nice Movement Animations for Units. The Effects are again cartoony, but in a good way that fits the general Artstyle.Same goes for the they show thier Emotions clearly and whatever they say correspondes to thier animations. Good Job.The is brilliant and requires forward thinking planning to get all the bonusses, the usage of mountains that unlike in Civ V nowMaybe a bit too much so, as wonders take space as well now, so you are basically doomed to know wich victory you want to achive (If you play with enabled victories, I myself turn them off pretty often) and know exactly how you want to set your city up before you even settle it. Apart from that, the system is highly encouraging and entertaining at all times.the System of Eurekas and Inspirations is great and makes science feel more directed than in Civ V. That's actually really good.The You can throw units together to make them stronger! Great! Unfortunally, there is no visual feedback except for...three tiny stars, so thats sad.

47,117.8,Not Recommended," May 19, 2017",4,"I have decided to rewrite this review for several reasons, reason one, I don't think I went into enough detail with the oringnal review, reason two, I didn't show everything the game had to offer, reason three, in the oringnal review I think I too harsh on the game. Those are my reason's for rewriting this, I know the last one will probably be critized, but this time I want to provide a more balanced review. BTW I don't think that the game deserves the unilateral support among the Major ""reviewers"" and I think the game can succed but it needs a more critical look at it, this is not a bad thing. Anyways on with the review.1. The Ai.There is no way to defend the terrible AI the game launched with it does not know how to (among other things) codinate attacks, manage it's economy, start a rational war and use the new system, this is indefenceable and needs to immediately fixed. Of course their not going to, but hay better to point it out then not, right.2. The new systems.The statistics for the new systems (codeword for I made them up) is that 70% had potential but failed miserabley (insert great people and religion system) 10% Failed completly (cough agenda cough) and 20% were alright (aka the new ""diplomacy""). I think the main problam here is that they had the right ideas but did not take it and played it safe, this means that some of the new machanics could have been so much better an example is the diplomacy, the diplomacy is bare bones to say the least but could have been so much more, you could have diplomcy with power blocs, federations and confederations, multi national agreements, a bigger roll for nuclear weapons ect, the ideas are endlees yet they kept the civilzation Vish diplomacy, They either 1. believe that civilization 5 diplomacy was good: unlikely, 2. they were too imcompatant to fix it: very unlikly, 3. Capitialism sucks: very likely, also very sad but hay at least it's not stalin, wait how did I get to stalin from civ 6 diplomacy, weird. Anyways that is basically the same for all systems, lots of potential but it was wasted.3. City States diplomacyThis is a step in the right direction, but is still a short fall, sorta. The idea that city states shoud be earned through diplomacy rather then money is a good step forward and the idea that for each layer of support you get rewards is one of the ideas that is actually a good one. However there are problems for example yes there is a tier reward system but once you get 6 there is no reason to continue, ways to imporve on this system is to make it so that you only get the bonuses from city-states if you are the surzeain of the city-state, and add new types of city-states ect.4. Armed forces.The game does do some good here, the corp and army system have potential, the ability to stack units is a nice feature, barbarians are not the best part of the game but still better then in civ 5 and you have to have the dooms day weapons (nukes). However there is still a lot that could be improved upon for example you could make the economy, governmnet and military more interconneted, so you need a strong economy and political support a war, overwise you will risk turning the populace a against you, you could also add real reasons for war I mean the casus beli they have now is lack luster to say the least, the way to fix this to is to add new reasons, for example disarmerment, government change and puppet ect. You could also have make spies have a larger in combat, create a logistics system for supplies, have an army cap based on population and add a war economy, which would redirect the economy into war mode.5. Government and politicasThe government system is not to great, it has the up side of being a massive leap forward but has the down side of being, like the rest of the game, not being took to it's full potential. For example they could add new governments like constitutional monarchy, republic and anarchy ect, they could add a parliament system and political parties along with it, budgets that are approved, elections ect the options are endless and you can do it, but they did not do that with it instead they kept it bare bones.Other things at a glanceday/night cycle- good idea, but they could add a climate and season/weather system and natural disasters.Districts- good idea on paper, not so much in reality, could use some improvement but not that bad.Religion- despartly needs reform and has potential.Great people- Good idea and could use some improvment but alround pretty good.Builders- not bother about it.And that is it if there is anythi- Oh yeah the ""DLC"" thing this is the most anogying thing, i am not going after the game on this one, but 2k's business practices, the fact that they can sell the game at full price and still charge for dlc is discracful so yeah don't buy it. EVER.That is it I mean it this time."

Unless you want the frustration of having to resign 10 turns into the game at deity level because the AI declares war on turn 5 with their starting units, or because of a massive swarm of barbarian horsemen, don't bother with this installment of the Civ series. Too much restarting to be of any fun.The game seems to think it chooses the best settling position for your starting settler, but it doesn't. The settling recommendations are horrible (what was intended to be noob-friendly ended up being quite useless 90% of the time because the algorithm does not take into account eureka-triggering resources, and overall path of tech... where one is forced to beeline archery no matter what the case is, if not because of aggressive AI, and mind you 90% of them are aggressive in stark contrast to BNW, OR simply because of barbarians), and the balanced start option is far from balanced.The AI leader screens are made cartoonish and overall looked cheap as if no effort was made into designing them (compared to Civ V BNW's for example), the music overall, aside from the opening theme, is not as good as the previous installments. What is good about this game is that the map graphics, especially those of natural wonders, look great. But overall, as a fan of the Civ series, this latest one leaves a lot to be desired in terms of strategy and balance."

63,17.4,Not Recommended," February 23, 2017",4,I wish I'd taken the negative reviews a little more seriously before wasting money on this game. As other reviewers indicate the AI is incredibly buggy. I've only played a few games and am finding the poor AI and what appears to be bad background coding is making the game unplayable. My first game (which I expected to lose) declared me the winner of a cultural victory at turn 41. Um. Okay. Thanks I guess? The next declared my AI opponent the winner for reasons I couldn't determine (at turn 110). I thought I'd try again - at turn 21 my AI opponent declared me incompetent and denounced me. Well. Fine then.It appears to me that whatever metric the game uses to drive the AI isn't in sync with the actual game state. AI comments in early game relate to later game events or states.I can't speak for multiplayer - perhaps the game is meant for that and the single player component wasn't tested properly.

334,83.3,Recommended," November 5, 2016",7,"Based on 80+ hours throughout multiple Deity difficulty games.Civilization VI has a lot to live up to, most obviously its predecessor Civilization V.Through the use of the excellent district mechanic and various reworked older elements such as great people, spies and religion it has introduced a lot more inherent conflict that wasn't previously present. As such, I've enjoyed every single victory condition (Science, Domination, Religion and Culture) more than I have before.It still suffers from poor AI (now especially noticable due to the poorly executed agenda system) and sadly Civilization VI has suffered in the UI department as well, but regardless I've highly enjoyed my time and can definitely say it is a great basegame worthy of your time.Full review:"
72,24.4,Not Recommended, February 11,4,"As a long-time fan of the Civ series, I can say that this a solid game. I won't fill this review with long explanations of the differences between VI and other Civ games... or with listing pros and cons. Rather, I'm just going to say that the entire experience is ruined by the unacceptable amount of time that the game takes to calculate each. Especially in the late game, even with animations turned off, the game takes 20 seconds, 30 seconds, 45 seconds, or even a full minute to calculate each turn. For this day and age, for a AAA game released from a major studi, this delay is unreasonable and shocking. I would expect each turn to take a few seconds at most.... a full minute is madness and ruins the experience. I can't take it... I'd refund if I could."
24,153.8,Not Recommended," October 26, 2016",4,"It is as if they purposely did not include features that made civ 5 playable, just to add them in later. No alert. Poor threat recognition. You cannot zoom out far enough. No mod support. Auto unit cycling, but with a lag. So if you act to fast then you just told the wrong unit to move.Plus, it is buggy. In big ways like CTD, but worse in little ways. Archers suddenly closing it to attack when they could have at range. Units that cannot skip turn unless the move first. Units that refuse to cancel or wake up until the next turn (terribly annoying with the unit cycling.)I am sure I'll love it post mod support, but right now it is uninstalled."
50,29.3,Recommended," October 27, 2016",4,"Product received for freeI don't write many reviews on steam but being a well seasoned Civ player I decided to do this for once.Positives:- New Styled Graphics; the cartoony goofy graphics provides a fresh new start to Civ, unlike Civ Beyond Earth, which gave new graphics but went the wrong direction. Although it will be a shock for Civ 5 players, and will take a while to adjust, it will nevertheless bring nostalgic memories to older Civ players.- Gameplay change; unlike Civ 5, this game will bring a larger focus on city building, letting you decide what you would mould your empire to become; cultural, militaristic or religious? Unlike previous installments, where the city with the biggest production produces everything, you have to more carefully decide what ""district"" you will build.Negatives:-Diplomacy; AI is still ♥♥♥♥ed, and declares war every century. Even Gandhi seem to be the most warmongering on the game from what I have seen (although this is the case for every Civ game for some reason) but I still hope this will be patched.-Borders; Just a small tweak but the borders are hard to differenciate from each other. A simple coloured line marks your territory. I played a game as China vs Japan and I could hardly tell the difference between our cities and empires. This is maybe because I am used to all territory to have a colour but I believe I will adjust to this.-Warfare: Although focus has been taking on infrastructure I can't help but notice that the quality of warfare has been dropped. Not only are enemies practically unconquerable until you get the Artillery unit but they also seem to be spamming units that provide buffer making it impossible to reach their cities. This again might be the AI's fault but I still appreciate they added new support units like Medic and Engineer. I also like the idea of combining units to form corps and armies, even though combining them does not provide double the damage which one might think.Conclusion:Overall this game provides a relief from Beyond Earth, and with some few patches on the AI this game will be a genuin success to the franchise."

80,491.6,Recommended," June 29, 2017",4,"Civ 6 is a great game, that's more dynamic and enjoyable than Civ 5, especially vanilla Civ 5. People who are leaving ratings are complaining about bad diplomacy, (which is fair because diplomacy is always terrible in Civ games) but this is the best diplomacy that a Civilization game has ever had for its AI. They're also complaining about barbarians, science, and production imbalance. Yeah, there are things that could be improved (and they will be as expansions come out; look at the difference between vanilla Civ V and Brave New World) but I've played this game a bunch and it isn't as bad as people are making it out to be. If you don't like the barbarians, turn them off, but it's not hard to defeat them.Half of the reviewers are just mad that they have to buy some of the civilizations as a DLC. The simple solution is to not buy the DLC; the game will run just the same. The other half of reviewers must just be bad at strategy games. Complaining that you end up fighting spearman with tanks means that you're playing on too low of a difficulty. If you're taking the time to learn the new district system, challenge yourself on the higher difficulty setting, and think strategically, you'll be just fine."

92,499.6,Not Recommended," November 22, 2016",4,"4.5/10I'm udpating my review because the game is several patches in now, but unfortunately I can't change the score or my recommendation against buying the game. This is a shame because I still feel it has a lot of potential, but the patches released so far haven't done anything to address the fundamental problems with it. At best, Civ VI is still only tolerable to play for a brief period of time. Instead of ""just one more turn before I quit,"" it's ""can I force myself to take one more turn before I quit."" A game shouldn't be an experience you tolerate. A root canal is an experience you have to tolerate. Games are supposed to be fun, and VI just isn't. I still can't recommend anyone spend their money on this.The fundamental problem remains that the lead designer, Ed Beach, didn't want to make a Civ game. What do I mean by that? The prior games in the franchise were randomized 4X sandbox games that emphasized empire building and management. Warfare was always a major aspect, but Ed Beach apparently wanted to make a straight up war game instead. So what he did was rig the game. Pretty much every aspect of it - from diplomacy to map seeding - is artificially weighted to make sure that AI always has a reason to hate the human player and constantly declares war.The end result of Ed Beach's ham fisted scripting makes every time you play feel exactly the same. Oh, the map and what civilzations you're playing against may change, but that's pretty much it. It's ALWAYS going to play out the same. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. By rigging the game so that the hostile AI will always declare war on you, he's turned Civ into the war game he wanted to make. You'll find youself forced to repeat the same military focused strategies every time you play. Each playthrough of prior Civ games was a different experience, and replayability has always been one of it's major selling points. Without that, the base game isn't worthy anywhere near it's heafty price tag.Pros:District System = I like unstacking the cities and the accompanying adjacency bonuses. It adds a whole new layer of strategic planning to the game. On an aesthetic level, it also gives cities a grander scale and makes them feel more like actual cities.City-States = City-states have been revamped, and have their own new diplomatic system involving assigning them envoys. As more envoys are assigned, new levels of perks are unlocked (bonuses to the capital, bonuses to districts, etc.). These bonuses are pretty generic among the different types of city-states until you reach the top level and become their suzerin (overlord). Each city state now has it's own unique top level bonus at that level that range from Lisbon giving extra gold on trade routes to a special tile improvement from La Venta, giving each a unique value.New Government System = The new government system was one of the things I was most put off by when they previewed it, but it's rapidly become one of my favorite new features allowing for greater customization and specific focus on the player's goals.Cons:Map Generation: Smaller map sizes are now larger, but larger map sizes are now smaller. It makes sense on the smaller maps since cities play wide instead of tall now, but larger maps are now too small. My biggest complaint, though, is is now a default to ensure another civ will spawn no more than X number of tiles from the player. This is set up to force early game conflict with an AI that is much more aggressive than in prior versions of the game. I don't like this at all. I - like I imagine most long time players - play for a random experience, not to be forced to follow some script the dev thinks I should. Because of this, you'll end up restarting over and over again until you get a map where you're not completely surrounded since the map generator jams city-state and civ starting locations so close together it feels like it's trying to play Tetris with them.Removal of Basic Features and Player Control: I squarely blame Ed Beach for this. He's on record in the preview videos hyping up the removal of certain features so it's a more ""dynamic"" experience and players have to ""pay more attention."" When the game released, the hostile unit alert was removed and has now been patched back in after complaints form the community, one of Ed Beach's innovations to make the player ""pay more attention."" At least now if a barbarian horde or enemy army shows up next to one of your fortified units, the game actually tells you. It's one of the few ""positive"" updates, diminished by the fact it should have been included in the game at launch. Barbarians now can't tap dance past your warrior waving spartklers without them noticing. I still can't figured what possessed him or anyone else on the design team to think this was ""dynamic"" instead of just being obnoxious. It's particularly annoying since the game decides it knows what you need to be looking at and constantly jerks the camera around.City growth is another major issue. After the first patch, we can finally see which tile is going to be claimed next, but the player has no control over it. All you can do is sit there and curse under your breath when you see it's going to claim a useless tile instead of a resource it could claim. There seems to be no rhym or reason to the tiles it chooses. I've seen it bypass four resource tiles - silk, horses, copper and iron - to claim an ocean tile with no resources anywhere near it. In a game about building and developing an empire, the player should have the option to manually control this. Making it random doesn't add depth, it's just handicapping the player under the false pretense of adding ""challenge"". This still hasn't been fixed.Barbarians: The new barbarian system is still buggy, they spawn far too early and too often. I've had three barbarian camps spawn around my capital, and been under seige by two of them by turn 7 on Prince. I've also watched camps spawn on the same tiles outside my borders over and over again after I've cleared them unless I postition a unit so it's in line of sight. If the camps keep spawing in the same locations over and over again, it's not random. It's another feature for some reason they felt needed to be scripted.Religion: In prior versions of the game, this was left to expansions and I wish it had been here. I can understand from a design perspective that it made sense to build it into the base game. With the new district system, there is now a religious districts and it makes sense to get all your districts - part of the basic mechanics - into the base game. That said, religion is broken and over-weighted.The new religious combat system is tedious and depending on what AI opponents you're facing you'll spend more time in religious combat than military combat. We also now have a Religious Victory. Quite frankly, this should be cut from the game. I'm fairly certain they only reason it's included was to justify all the work spent on religion when Diplomatic victory was left out of the game and so many other areas were crying out for more work. The religious victory mechanics now make it possible for you to loose to an AI player you haven't even met yet. The ability to achieve religious victory depends far to heavily on starting location and who is closest to the majority of civs. It feels clumsy and poorly implemented."

Some might consider it's style ""Childish"" and ""Casual mobile"" but it looks well made in that regard and has a number of little animations like spinning Watermills, doves over your Holy Sites and nice Movement Animations for Units. The Effects are again cartoony, but in a good way that fits the general Artstyle.Same goes for the Leaders they show thier Emotions clearly and whatever they say correspondes to thier animations. Good Job.The unstacking of cities is brilliant and requires forward thinking planning to get all the bonusses, the usage of mountains that unlike in Civ V now feel like they actually do somethingMaybe a bit too much so, as wonders take space as well now, so you are basically doomed to know wich victory you want to achive (If you play with enabled victories, I myself turn them off pretty often) and know exactly how you want to set your city up before you even settle it. Apart from that, the system is highly encouraging and entertaining at all times.the System of Eurekas and Inspirations is great and makes science feel more directed than in Civ V. That's actually really good.The You can throw units together to make them stronger! Great! Unfortunally, there is no visual feedback except for...three tiny stars, so thats sad. Show us that there are more unites or ships involved! Fix pls.Well that's good.Now for the or as I like to call itObviously, the . The I has no buissness here. IT's entirely disruptive, the Civs have no personality in how and where they settle, dispite the wich are a nice Ida, but in reality, are just different reasons for the A""I"" to declare war on you.Everything they do is to hurt and hinder you, esspecially in how they settle:This in a Late Aplha, Early Beta State and has hardly improved over five months. Which is dumb.Oh and they cheat like every terrible player.The Is inconvenient. It's not bad, just not good. Why do you make it needlessly hard?Pointless and I have no goddarn Idea why certain bugs where left in from October and have just been fixed. WHY?`There is no point to the Digital Deluxe, because the fist DLC is worthless. Firaxis has been pumping out DLC without fixing thier darn game.Last Point!404 Not Found. DLC Factions Like Poland (Can now into Space) and Australia have culture shock abilities wich are just the worst. The steal Land. Alexander?Never stop conquesting. The Azects? Sure let them build everything in no time.England? You mean that one Civ that never survives? And who and what is a Kongo? Ohhh, the ones that declare war on everyone for not getting all religion are wiped out really early.The Civs are just extremly pooly balanced. Why, just why Firaxis.It is an ok game for now, but I can't truly recommend it as it stands now.The mistakes made by Firaxis are dumb and pointless, by the way."

601,34.2,Recommended," October 25, 2016",4,"This game is so much better than Civ 5 was on release and even with G&K added as well as some of BNW.The graphics style resembles Endless Legend more than it does a mobile title, which is really refreshing compared to Civ 5's muted, clustered, and almost drowned out coloration, which makes it a very beautiful terrain and map.The AI is little different from civ 5 which doesn't bother me all too much, that familiarity is nice to have for me.Religion is a base mechanic and actually useful beyond Industrial Era, which is a big noting point for me. Also likewise espeionage is in the base game, and more useful than just spying on other civs and city states.Dealing with city states is better than before where you'd just throw money at them to be allies or hope you'd get a quest you can actually do.Also likewise the fighting and waging war was revamped but I haven't looked too much into it, but I can say it is more streamlined than what Civ 5 had.It's also pretty bug free, at least 10% of the playerbase has issues but I've found none so far, this is one of the cleanest releases of 2016.Gee Greece, how come Firaxis lets you have TWO leaders!?So yea I like it, this game is amazing, a worthy addition to the Civ series, but the $60 selling price is very steep, but considering that this came out October recently, you could nab it in your Christmas shopping."

From Civ II to Civ V, I would stay up way later than I should and play, because I had to ""just get the next turn done."" But this one, isn't fun, it's boring. Mostly because all of the challenge has been removed. It's as if I'm just grinding like I would in an MMORPG, or Assassin's Creed (the new ones). It's a tragedy! Perhaps Firaxis is attempting to cater to console and facebook mobile gamers, but it's the wrong direction.2. Don't care for the graphics - The map and land and units are nice, the interface is ok. It's the people, striving for realism has been a ""thing"" for 20 years. Now, they look like Pixar cartoon characters. I'm interested in a game that has 100% focus on the adventure of building an empire, not how the leaders look. It seems as if, a nice package was more important than gameplay.3. This is just going to be an array of bad things: Can't re-name cities. Can't change unit names, once named. Movement is worse, and roads do almost nothing. I feel like it's a facebook game. Took me 30 minutes to figure out my unit cost. The game is sluggish. It's task based almost (elimination of the RPG part).4. And why I wrote the review: The Civilopedia, is terrible - there's no information that's useful, they got super lazy with that one. For the newbies, this is important, because sometimes for planning purposes it's important to know unit upgrades and progression, before you start to upgrade units.5. The AI is insane, and has absolutely no logic operators whatsoever, they act completely randomly. I declared war on myself, and got a warmonger penalty (WTF?) - this happened, but I didn't declare it, a screen popped up and just told me I was at war with myself. Perhaps a bug, but these people should know a thing or two about releasing a working game. The AI seemingly have no reason for disliking you or liking you. I run a peaceful game, but as TR said: ""Walk softly, and carry a big stick."" I'm peaceful, isolationist, but I carry with me a mighty wrath - I will destroy a civ that attacks me first. It's just how I play. I had four civ's declare war on me and I was able to lay waste to all four of them before 430BC. The sad part, not only did I not provoke them, nor did I have a government or policies they disliked, it's like they bugged out and went to war. I'm playing on Deity! Worse yet: No matter what decisions I make, the AI will always react the same. The AI should be far more intuitive and trading and diplomacy should be better at this point, it's worse than the diplomacy in Civ III. I should feel like I'm dealing with real world leaders, not angry school children (I understand the irony in that statement).6. Unit stacking is a no go. I understand limiting unit stacks to create a challenge. But at least let me stack a couple of combat units in one hex for organizational purposes. This was a bad feature in Civ IV, and V and a worse feature here.7. The Barbarians are a bigger threat than any civilization, and they're everywhere. This is a con and a pro - the biggest con is that they're more dangerous than a civilization. The pro is that they're a challenge, and I love it.8. Where is the demographic screen?9. What were you thinking with city states? Poorly executed.The Pros: What's good?1. The Policy interface is awesome, as is the entire new government interface.

But that never happened.I miss the city view, unit stacking, square map tiles, single tile things (remember, a tile respresents an imense amount of land) and challenging AI.But this is only my view point.

193,63.6,Not Recommended," December 18, 2016",4,"Can't recommend this game currently. There are some nice additions to the game, such as more challenging barbarians, finite workers and the interesting civic tree. However, some additions are not implemented well. For example, the AI is too angry - it becomes nearly impossible to uphold good relation. Furthermore, when playing on large/huge maps, I find that some AIs have barely done anything and only have 1 city and are 2/3 eras behind when I am in the modern era, and some civs have reached the atomic era before I have reached the industrial era. I think that the tech tree could do with some tweaking to help make it more balanced. For example, in Civ 5 the progression of the tech tree felt very fluent, so that I wouldn't have those 1/2 turn techs to research when I was 2 eras ahead. However, in Civ 6, it is too easy to just follow a single branch to get the tech that you want. You know there's something wrong when you can still produce seige towers in the modern era. I'm not a huge fan of districts, and find them more of a burden distracting from the pace of the game, but I do believe they have potential.EDIT: CTD bug fixedI would still be tempted to recommend this game if it were not for the bugs - gamebreaking bugs. I can't progress beyond ~ turn 200 as I get a CTD, so I'm unable to progress into the late game. This is honestly inexcusable, especially nearly a month after release.

It took two expansions for Civ V to become a good game and several mods for it to become a great game. So why didn't they learn their lesson from their own previous expansions? Similarly, why didn't they incorporate elements from the most successful mods into their new game? They ignore their fan base, they don't test their games, they give us half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥released... this was a money grab pure and simple.I see a lot of people saying ""wait for the expansion"" or ""don't worry, a mod will fix that"" -- shouldn't the onus be on Firaxis to release a full gaming experience?

Civ V changed a lot of things from the previous version, so I can somewhat understand why it wasn't 100% on release... but Civ VI just feels like a really dull version of Civ V. The removed a bunch of the depth that made Civ V great and only gave us a couple of game mechanics that seem like good ideas on paper but don't currently work together to increase the levels of enjoyment in the game itself.The game play is unbalanced, the graphics are a HUGE step backwards (looks like some freemium mobile game), the AI managed to get worse, the civs are boring, diplomacy is useless, religion is annoying... and basically it feels like they've nerfed most of the things that made Civ V so great.""Wait for the expansions"" how about wait for the bargain bin because right now this game is nowhere near where Civ V left off."

As such, I've enjoyed every single victory condition (Science, Domination, Religion and Culture) more than I have before.It still suffers from poor AI (now especially noticable due to the poorly executed agenda system) and sadly Civilization VI has suffered in the UI department as well, but regardless I've highly enjoyed my time and can definitely say it is a great basegame worthy of your time.Full review:"

53,233.3,Not Recommended," December 22, 2016",4,"First let me get this point acroos Civ 6 is NOT a bad game however is it a dissapointing game? YES! Why? I tell you why. 1st of all there are several things missing like for example options to turn off spies (wich are a pain in the butt) is absent, some map types are gone, and even the option to adjust the number of citystates is gone which can make this game feel even more like a dissapointing game since your missing stuff from the previous civ games. As for graphics i can tolerate them but for some leaders they look absurd. speacking of leaders yoll end up wanting to watch every single one of them be killed in the most millicaous ways possible (esspicaly cleopatria) after the crap they give you. they will declare war, spy on you (and only you), make stupid threats, constantly spam you with the worst trades possible, and as always complain about your warmongering (tbh i wish the warmoongering system was never invented) at least in civ 5 your allies dint turn on you after 1 city taken. It seems like there is too little from an improvment to be declared as a civ 6 and it is ESSPICALLY not worth 60$. Until i see major improvments in the ai, features added back i cant reccomened it.In conclusion if you want a good civ game get CIV 5 and Brave new world. Now that is worth your money.UPDATEI recently heard that steams workshop IS coming however i dont think modders should be responsible for adding the missing contentgame has recently added options to citystates but only on SOME maps"
0,73.6,Not Recommended," November 10, 2016",7,"First off, let me say that I have been a civ player since the very first game. I love the series and have stuck with it throughout its many iterations. I will continue to stick with it, even though I am mildly disappointed with this first version of civ 6. I may not be recommending this game right now, but, much like civ 5, I see the potential in this game to be something great after some much needed changes.-Districts: Why do these take so much production to build? Why can't their placement be cancelled in case the player makes a mistake (when no production has even been put in yet)? Why does the cost of a district increase as the game goes on? Modern construction technology should ease the creation of a district rather than make it more difficult to produce. This is an unrealistic and silly aspect of the game. It should be a steady, cheap cost the entire game. Furthermore, add in tooltips better explaining adjacency bonuses for players who don't know how to find the useful (player-made) guides on reddit or wikipedia.-Spies: I like the fact that spies defend a specific district and any adjacent districts. This encourages better city planning. However, why do spies need new orders every few turns? There should be a spy overview that allows you unassign and re-assign spies when needed, rather than being constantly prompted every few turns. This is unnecessary micromanagement that detracts from the flow of the game.-Trade Routes: Tying in with spies, why are trade routes constantly an issue? Why not allow the player to set a trade route and then cancel it when they want to rather than being forced to renew them every 10 turns or so. Late game, with over 10 trade routes going at a time, you will spend a good chunk of your time micromanaging these trade routes rather than dealing with more interesting aspects of the game. Give the player the ability to choose when/if they want to deal with this rather than forcing it down their throats every 10 turns.-Units: Why do fortified units look practically identical to units that have simply used up their movement for the turn? Previous civ games have changed the shape of the unit's icon to better visually indicate that the unit is fortified. Why can't units go on Alert rather than just Sleep or Fortify? Why do chained units require an order for each unit in the chain? Shouldn't they be controlled as a stack with the option to control separately rather than forcing separate activation?-Cities: Why is there no building queue? Every single 4x game out there has a building queue. Why can't buildings be rushed or bought out any more?-Wonders: Why is there no refund for failed attempts at building a wonder? What, the dead building just disappears and no resources are harvested from it? Why can't wonder construction be cancelled and placed differently if a mistake was made in the initial placement?-City-states: Why aren't your envoys returned to you if a city-state is conquered by another civ?-Notifications: Why does the player need to know EVERY SINGLE THING that an enemy civ does through the rather bland reports that pop up at the top of the screen? Shouldn't specific and important events be highlighted rather than ""oh, civ X just settled their 20th city"". Was it impossible to use the bold font for important things?-City Defense: Why is the player not notified (a la Civ 5's system) when an enemy unit is in range of city defenses? Instead we see a tiny red button below the city, but if a player is otherwise distracted they can miss their opportunity to stop a barbarian or enemy unit from ravaging half the countryside.-Barbarians: I appreciate barbarians, I do. However, it is incredibly silly that they can spawn in any fog of war tile and are immediately hostile to everyone. Not to mention their endless (and fast!) supply of units. Tell me, is it realistic that every tribe and minor civ in history was immediately hostile to everyone? No, it isn't. Perhaps make it a 50/50 chance that they are hostile, or maybe that non-hostile barbs turn into peaceful villages. Look to Endless Legend for a better system. The minor faction villages in that slowly accumulate units to aid their own defense, but rarely ever have many units roaming around. Furthermore, they might attack your units, but they never siege your cities unless you♥♥♥♥♥♥them off. The barbarian system in civ 6 is an outdated mess that worked for the older games but demands a revision for modern gaming.-Religious Victory: This victory mode, although long overdue in the series, is an absolute mess. Currently it can be summed up as ""whoever spams the most apostles and missionaries wins"". Religious combat is a joke and constitutes throwing melee-only units at each other until one side dies. I don't believe defensive bonuses even apply as they normally would for military units (I could be very wrong about this). Why do nearby cities lose belief if they see an apostle fail in combat? Have you ever known a religious person to be that fickle? Civ 5's religious pressure system, although imperfect, was superior to the newer system. Spamming apostles and sending them at enemy cities/apostles is not interesting gameplay.-Culture victory: Needs reworking.-Diplomacy: The agenda system seems like a good idea, but shouldn’t the AI judge you more on your actions rather than really weird “goals” or styles of play? Why does an AI that has been at peace with you the entire game, trading prosperously, suddenly decide to denounce you or declare war on you simply because you didn’t play the game exactly how they wanted you to? Historically, neighbors fought each other more than countries from all the way across the world.Would write more, but I ran out of space."

156,132.7,Not Recommended," December 22, 2016",4,AI are terrible! Earth map with the update is terrible! The game feels unfinished and like a skeleton of Civ V. There's a ton of limitations and just not as many options as there were for gameplay in Civ V. Complete waste of money.

I have played IV, V and now VI, but the last one is broken.The main issue is the AI, in it current state it does not work in single player. I just won't take cities or defend it in the most basic form. I don't belief that they have done anything with playtest reports or did any thing with the AI issues in V. It is probalby the same with same extra because of the new features.Keep in mind that this cost almost 60 euro's! that is not for an early acces game, but should for a complete game.

37,190.0,Not Recommended," December 1, 2016",4,"So much potential in this game, but for now if I play Civ it's going to be Civ 5. The AI is simply too incompetent to pose a challenge, once you have city walls up it's basically impossible for them to take your city.The system of ""3 combat strength higher = you DOMINATE the opposing unit"" needs to be reworked to give the lower unit some chance. You would think that going from 20 to 25 combat strength would be more impactful than going from 70 to 75, but it is equal impact. At this point you can take down every civ for a domination victory by forming corps with a melee unit, ranged, and 1 or 2 seige units + a great general. Each city you take helps snowball towards a MASSIVE science & culture lead...leading to more advanced units/corps/armies...you get the picture.I love many things about this game, however. The culture tree, government, policy system, district placement strategies, competing for great people, religious beliefs...all top notch."

307,12.3,Not Recommended," March 14, 2017",4,"So far this game is a terrible disappointment. 5 months on from release, the AI issues still aren't resolved. I bought the Digital Deluxe edition, paying $20 more, for access to the first four DLC packs at a supposedly better price than buying them individually. So far the 3 I've been given are selling on Steam for $4.99 each, so unless the next pack is expansion-level content with a pricetag of at least $14.99 I'm going to feel even more ripped off than I already do. Save yourself a whole lot of disappointment and just buy the Civ V complete package instead. It's an infinitely better game.Edited 4/1: the fourth piece of included DLC came out on 3/28. It's 2 more Civs and one more scenario, retail price 8.99. I saved 4 dollars by buying the deluxe, and after 6 months this game is no closer to being playable than it was at launch. Two bad games in a row for the franchise (Beyond Earth, even with Rising Tide, is no good). Hopefully they fix this but I don't know that I'm willing to spend money on the expansion content that it'll take to do that."

45,416.1,Not Recommended," November 11, 2016",4,"So Ive been playing this game for a while, 55 hours as of writing this, and im really having issues with what to do, thumbs up or down...In the end though, i will not recommend this game, although it has various good points.Plus:-The district system is very nice, forces you to consider placement of future districts and wonder while balancing the recourses nearby.-Wonders requiring a tile is smart, gives you more of a penalty if you dont finish while also taking a tile from your city if you do.-The civics tree is interesting, culture in general feels much more immersive and competative than before.-The earning of great people allows for you to play in alot of different ways and screw over your opponents by taking something that they could use.-Combat units are balanced.-The addition of projects let you produce something of worth when no buildings are available instead of just units, gold or science.Minus:-Religious victory is completely overpowered, especially in pve games. its too easy to take over another Civ with religion, especially if that Civ isnt specifically aiming for that victory.-There arent enough great works slots. especially for the Writers, there is 1 spot in an aphitheater for each city, other than that, you need wonders, which makes writers useless, especially considering they produce 2-3 pieces each.-Leader and civilization powers are weirdly specific and sometimes useless. The powers need you to have or do some very specific things that are sometimes very bad. for example, Russias leader Peter has the ability to receive ekstra science and culture from traderoutes with Civ that are more advanced than them. This means that to make greatest use of this leader, 2 victory conditions have been eliminated.-Amenities, Housing and Population. on paper it seems smart but in reality, housing and amenities stop the player from settling alot of places early in the game simply because they wont result in anything, and when playing against high level AI, early settling is key. its also not well explained what ""entertainment"" is in the game, as the ""entertainment complex"" district says it gives amenities from different sources of ""entertainment"".-Not alot of map options so far, it was okay in civ 5 after all the expansions but to have this little option and with very few ways of controlling how the map will form? not good.-No way to play co-op. Civ 5 had a broken way of playing co-op but at least you could still do it, here, you have no actual way of playing any real co-op, which really makes it uninteresting to do.And lastly, the big issue that everyone is annoyed with:-AI. So many new things in Civ 6 were based on giving AI an overhaul and give them personality and agenda. which they did. they just all have the same, almost immidiately denounce, go to war for petty reasons, rinse repeat. There are so many more issues with AI but this review is long enough."

I am yet another long time cvilization player (as well as alpha centauri and beyond earth), giving this latest addition a bad review. The ai is horrendous (why a twenty five year old game like alpha has better ai I will never know). It seems that what matters is creating aconvolutd tech tree and impossibly boring game play. It seems to simply drag on. I truly truly wish steam would give me back my money and take the game from my list."
120,175.2,Not Recommended," September 7, 2017",4,"This game is difficult to review. While on the one hand it is visually stunning and optimized pretty well, the gameplay is lackluster and leaves much to be desired. The most recent DLC, Nubia, broke my game so I've not played as them. I can tell you through my 175 hours in game to not buy this game. If you liked Civ V, you won't like this game. It is a very trying experience and will make you lose your patience quickly if you let it. AI is dumb, mechanics are dumber, leaders and civs are equally as stupid."
161,23.2,Not Recommended," December 12, 2016",7,"There are some good things to be said about Civ6. The new system for religion, for example, is both more rewarding and more realistic thanks to the fact that it can be tailored to a civilizations needs or incliniations. The districting system, while not necessarily an improvement over older games, provides a fresh new way to think about city management.Unfortunately the good is lost in a sea of bad design choices. The very best example of this is the new ""Eureka"" system for technological development. You are essentially given one quest per tech, which cuts the cost of that tech in half if you do the quest. Such a powerful incentive means you will have to go out of your way to perform many random actions if you want to stay competetive technologically, turning the game into an RPG style deluge of meaningless tasks.Speaking of competetive, the AI is most certainly not when it comes to combat. Playing on a high level, I found myself in a situation where Brazil had a much larger army than mine. They declared war and should have easily been able to take my border city. Instead they wandered around my territory and slowly let me shoot them to peices, seldom even attacking any of my units or cities. I ground them all into meat without losing a single unit.The removal of the civ-wide ""Happiness"" type feature seen in Civ5 returns us to the days where explosive expansion has barely any limitations. This removes the need for the subtler strategies we developed to deal with happiness limitations and once again reduces us to a formula of pumping out settlers or soldiers as fast as possible, with infrastructure being considered only as it allows us to achieve those two previously mentioned ends.I tried it, and I wanted to love it, but I just don't want to play it."
193,63.6,Not Recommended," December 18, 2016",4,"Can't recommend this game currently. There are some nice additions to the game, such as more challenging barbarians, finite workers and the interesting civic tree. However, some additions are not implemented well. For example, the AI is too angry - it becomes nearly impossible to uphold good relation. Furthermore, when playing on large/huge maps, I find that some AIs have barely done anything and only have 1 city and are 2/3 eras behind when I am in the modern era, and some civs have reached the atomic era before I have reached the industrial era. I think that the tech tree could do with some tweaking to help make it more balanced. For example, in Civ 5 the progression of the tech tree felt very fluent, so that I wouldn't have those 1/2 turn techs to research when I was 2 eras ahead. However, in Civ 6, it is too easy to just follow a single branch to get the tech that you want. You know there's something wrong when you can still produce seige towers in the modern era. I'm not a huge fan of districts, and find them more of a burden distracting from the pace of the game, but I do believe they have potential.EDIT: CTD bug fixedI would still be tempted to recommend this game if it were not for the bugs - gamebreaking bugs. I can't progress beyond ~ turn 200 as I get a CTD, so I'm unable to progress into the late game. This is honestly inexcusable, especially nearly a month after release. For this reason alone, I cannot recommend this game"

The think that kept me playing Civ 5 and loving the game for so long was the infinte customzation that fan modding brought. If the game felt boring, download a few mods and suddenly you have new choices to make in your next game. This game has already become played out to me, and has left a bad taste in my mouth.

64,119.1,Not Recommended," September 3, 2017",4,"In it's current form I wouldn't recommend this game. It is fun and has a lot of potential and I have enjoyed playing it but there are issues that I just can't ignore anymore. Unfortunately the AI isn't very intelligent, for example sometimes they just all turn on you for no reason and all declare war, I literally have no idea why. On occasions the AI will constantly spam you for a declaration of friendship every turn leading me to denouncing them just to stop it. One turn they will love you and in their next turn they hate you. City states seem completely useless as they did in the last game, they declare war but rarely engage in any meaningful combat or make any ground. In my current playthrough I have gained 3 cities through peace deals in wars where we never came into contact or barely made contact. I simply throw 20-30 gold per turn as part of the peace deal and I exchange for one of their cities.The next set of issues for myself has to be how buggy this game can be. I am currently looking at the game on my other monitor and I am unable to transfer great works from one full museum to a museum with a free slot. When I grab an artifact to trasnfer I am greeted by a box that say's ""Are you sure?"" and there is no option to click yes or no. It's just a dialog box that is broken. If I hit escape it closes this dialog box and I still have the artifact attached to my cursor but I am unable to drop it into any open slots and have to just hammer escape to close the Great Works screen all together. So it's basically broken. Sometimes I task a unit to move to a certain area of the map and for no reason they just sit there forever, not moving. When I check they still have the destination set with nothing obstructing them or blocking their destination tile, they just refuse to move. Another thing this game likes to do is when I ask it to exit to desktop it just freezes up and never closes forcing me to end it's process in Task Manager. Sometimes linking a unit such as an Admiral for example to follow around a Battleship, the admiral will get left behind and bug out, causing it to not follow the unit it is linked with.Other issues are not being able to remove districts, once you've set them then they're permanent (unless you mod the game) and also no production queue as standard, a step back from the previous game. Theological combat is a bit off at times and I have had a single enemy AI Apostle just steam rolling all of my units like some God in human form. There are some Civs that are incredibly unbalanced (OP) and there needs to be some serious balancing. This is usually the case in Civ games with certain Civ's being better than others but in Civ 6 some of them are just way too good, usually in terms of their technological advancements/science generation. Conservationists are useless, seemingly can't be used anywhere on the map. Apparently they can be used, but after 80+ hours I've yet to be able to use a Conservationist unit or find anywhere suitable to use them on any of the maps I have played. My last major issue is Amenities. It just isn't clear what effects it, how and why. I know it is basically the happiness system from Civ 5 but it just feels opaque and hard to figure out at times. Some of my cities will randomly become unhappy (lack of amenities) and there are very few policy cards that address amenity issues, especially in the late game stages.Minor issue/annoyance for me is when you have an Armada of Battleships there's only 1 ship unit shown. It would be nice if there were perhaps multiple units shown however I am playing on fairly low settings at the moment and I am unsure if that effects it or not.The longer I play this game the more noticeable the issues are and more of an annoyance they become. I would be willing to look past these issues as some of them aren't too bad however this game isn't cheap and I doubt all of it's future expansions will be either. Now I do enjoy this game when I distance myself from the unitelligent and random AI and ignore some of the bugs, at it's core it has a lot of potential to be a great Civ game. Some of the changes to this game I believe are better from Civ 5 such as how resources work for example. You now only need access to 1 Iron resource to build multiple Swordsman units where as before you would have needed 1 Iron resource for each unit. However as it stands I would not recommend this game."

That is pretty much where the good things end. The AI is terrible, worse than civ 5.. i didnt belive the reviews i was reading before, purchased the game anyway because i love the series but oh my god its a step backwards:1. The AI doesnt want to expand thier empires, they often only have a handful of cities by the time you have 102. The AI does not want to be your friend, ever. They barely want to trade with you and the options are limited on what you can do with them.3. Expect to be declared war on for absolutely no reason but your armies will be met with AI units that dont want to attack your cities. They will instead, pillage your improvements and just inconvinience you for a few turns.4. Expect to be denounced for everything you do, even by your allies.5. Expect spain to send 5,000 apostles to your lands making your religion completely obselete (do yourself a favor and dont put them in the game)5. Even if you start a large map and keep it to 5 players, for some reason the game will put you adjacent to one or more civs, not giving you any room to grow or branch out.6.

This game takes the best elements of previous Civ games and puts them to the torch. The deciding factor for me was when the Caravan made a road between 2 settlements (lovely principle in theory, terrible execution) and not the builder. If you don't realise what a huge deal that is - you haven't been thinking strategically enough, so I'll give you a hint - you can't place roads where you want yourself. The A.I. is terrible and has not been improved. You would have thought with such a huge following and the serious time that has now been invested in it (nearly 20 years!) they would have got it right by now, but no (vivid example - Stonehenge requires YOU to build it beside a Stone resource - does the AI require this - no - thereby practically always going to beat you to it at higher levels). So stupid, it can't even follow simple protocol. This is very lazy developing and I refuse to accomodate it.I do not recommend this product.[ edit ]I have been refused refund by Steam due to time played - i.e. 15 hours (above their 2 hour threshold).There is no way that you would find some of these issues unless you have been playing for this long. Lesson learnt - wait and read reviews. A very good review within the community was written by Anamizefan in which he goes into a lot of the issues. One telling thing though is that he hasn't finished a single game yet. It just gets too boring.

So I pushed through and in fairness the more I played it did get better. But the nagging feeling always remains that I'd still rather be playing Civ5.That's the problem. Its not (at this stage) a more interesting or enjoyable experience than last time. The Devs should be writing to people with 1000 hours (Ive got around 800) in Civ5 and asking them why. What did they love about it?What would they improve?In civ6 I feel as though I have less control and less freedom to play the way I want. And the game focuses on the things that I always found boring - like victory conditions. In all my hours I never cared about victory types and almost never finished a game. The victory types in Civ always seem so unfair and thus no clear measure of performance. So I generally ignore them, especially in Civ5 where all it does is end the game and tell you someone has won. Yawn.What was fun about Civ5 was exploring, defending, expanding, rushing to find and secure the best land and finite resources, building your empire. Once there was little cloud to explore and no land to grab before someone else, I always became quite bored with empire maintenance and building toward some uninspiring 'victory' type.I was hoping they would recognise that and withhold part of the map or make part of it usless for settlement until mid-late game. Perhaps a new technology may allow you to access or settle new areas because essentially thats the fun part.Civ5 I always found it balanced offering you tough choices without feeling like micro-managment. In Civ6 sometimes there is nothing I want my city to produce, choices of where to settle a new city are so restrictive that its not really a choice. There isnt much in the way of buildings early game so no hard decisions there. Exploring feels like a chore rather than an adventure. The art style is ugly. AI is well - insane. Plus Im not going to spend all my time reading about what makes a particular AI character happy or unhappy. AI should be intuitive if youre a good neighbour and you keep your promises and they are not an agressive AI you should have no problem. The ammount of gold you generate per turn for example, should have no baring and does really restrict the way you play if you want to keep an AI civ happy. Chosing policies is a chore and its a lot of reading with no real big picture plan. Wonders are less wonderful and the number of players who can compete for them is now even more restrictive as they bizareley wemt for 'realism', so no need to stress if you will get there first.One thing I've wanted to see for a long time is genuine unit diversity between nations or regions. Giving each civ 2 token 'unique' units that you may never even use is not exactly game changing. I wanted it to feel like there really is a difference when selecting your civ and not just a cookie cutter reskin with some minor changes or perks.Overall playing Civ6 has less of the things I enjoy. I feel less free, less in control, not as able to plan ahead, and the whole experience feels a great deal more aimless. Although there are plenty of things to work towards like completing mindless tasks for city-states for example, there are very few things on offer that I care about enough to bother working towards.I'll keep playing it because I really want to like it more. But I have a feeling Civ5 will always be the more balanced, better looking, more interesting game.Thats why im giving it a no."

One of the positive things about the series was that you could actually beat the AI unlike in a lot of other genres. If I wanted to play a game that destroys you on the lowest settings I could select from a host of other games. I want my money back.

92,178.1,Not Recommended," July 1, 2017",4,I am a big fan of the Civilization series. However i feel the game got easier and lost some of it's mechanics compared to Civ 5. I am happy with the graphic improvments but for a similation like this the looks bring down the performance a lot.

110,74.2,Not Recommended," December 10, 2016",4,"The mechanics of this game are a wide step away from previous Civilization games; many of which make it feel more like the first part of a new series than an entry into an established IP. I have been a huge fan of the series since its inception, and this game really feels more like it was created as a mobile version than a full PC release. Graphically, the game has taken huge steps backwards, opting for a highly-saturated cartoon aesthetic than the realism that such a game really demands. In many ways, the game feels incomplete and most of the newly implemented mechanics (the government card systems, expiring workers, and AI players as a whole) really make the game feel less intuitive and effective than previous entries.I was expecting a game that built and improved upon the innovations from Civilization IV, V and Beyond Earth, yet this game has completely disposed of that feeling.Overall Synopsis: Very disappointed. Hopefully more content will be added soon that makes the game more playable. Without that, the game really has very little play value, let alone replay value."

31,432.3,Not Recommended," September 3, 2017",4,It's a lot of fun to play...when it's working. 2K Firaxis has done terrible/non-existant QA for the game and have introduced game breaking bug after game breaking bug.I reccomend sticking with Civ V until a more funcitonal version exists.
64,119.1,Not Recommended," September 3, 2017",4,"In it's current form I wouldn't recommend this game. It is fun and has a lot of potential and I have enjoyed playing it but there are issues that I just can't ignore anymore. Unfortunately the AI isn't very intelligent, for example sometimes they just all turn on you for no reason and all declare war, I literally have no idea why. On occasions the AI will constantly spam you for a declaration of friendship every turn leading me to denouncing them just to stop it. One turn they will love you and in their next turn they hate you. City states seem completely useless as they did in the last game, they declare war but rarely engage in any meaningful combat or make any ground. In my current playthrough I have gained 3 cities through peace deals in wars where we never came into contact or barely made contact. I simply throw 20-30 gold per turn as part of the peace deal and I exchange for one of their cities.The next set of issues for myself has to be how buggy this game can be. I am currently looking at the game on my other monitor and I am unable to transfer great works from one full museum to a museum with a free slot. When I grab an artifact to trasnfer I am greeted by a box that say's ""Are you sure?"" and there is no option to click yes or no. It's just a dialog box that is broken. If I hit escape it closes this dialog box and I still have the artifact attached to my cursor but I am unable to drop it into any open slots and have to just hammer escape to close the Great Works screen all together. So it's basically broken. Sometimes I task a unit to move to a certain area of the map and for no reason they just sit there forever, not moving. When I check they still have the destination set with nothing obstructing them or blocking their destination tile, they just refuse to move. Another thing this game likes to do is when I ask it to exit to desktop it just freezes up and never closes forcing me to end it's process in Task Manager. Sometimes linking a unit such as an Admiral for example to follow around a Battleship, the admiral will get left behind and bug out, causing it to not follow the unit it is linked with.Other issues are not being able to remove districts, once you've set them then they're permanent (unless you mod the game) and also no production queue as standard, a step back from the previous game. Theological combat is a bit off at times and I have had a single enemy AI Apostle just steam rolling all of my units like some God in human form. There are some Civs that are incredibly unbalanced (OP) and there needs to be some serious balancing. This is usually the case in Civ games with certain Civ's being better than others but in Civ 6 some of them are just way too good, usually in terms of their technological advancements/science generation. Conservationists are useless, seemingly can't be used anywhere on the map. Apparently they can be used, but after 80+ hours I've yet to be able to use a Conservationist unit or find anywhere suitable to use them on any of the maps I have played. My last major issue is Amenities. It just isn't clear what effects it, how and why. I know it is basically the happiness system from Civ 5 but it just feels opaque and hard to figure out at times. Some of my cities will randomly become unhappy (lack of amenities) and there are very few policy cards that address amenity issues, especially in the late game stages.Minor issue/annoyance for me is when you have an Armada of Battleships there's only 1 ship unit shown. It would be nice if there were perhaps multiple units shown however I am playing on fairly low settings at the moment and I am unsure if that effects it or not.The longer I play this game the more noticeable the issues are and more of an annoyance they become. I would be willing to look past these issues as some of them aren't too bad however this game isn't cheap and I doubt all of it's future expansions will be either. Now I do enjoy this game when I distance myself from the unitelligent and random AI and ignore some of the bugs, at it's core it has a lot of potential to be a great Civ game. Some of the changes to this game I believe are better from Civ 5 such as how resources work for example. You now only need access to 1 Iron resource to build multiple Swordsman units where as before you would have needed 1 Iron resource for each unit. However as it stands I would not recommend this game."

465,56.9,Not Recommended," February 23, 2017",4,"Well, my recommendation to you is to keep on playing Civ 5.There are some tiny things which bother me:Cities can't be upgraded anymore in a depth that I would like to have, you have 1 or 2 buildings in the city and the rest is standing arround the city, that makes the city looks pity and also takes the depth of ""build a big city where tourist come and go""Now every wonder, even the small ones just stand on a tile, they could've made a great change, wonders like the Ruhr Valley have to get one special tile, wonders like the Brandenburger Gate stand in the city.Also the tile managment is a bit confusing. You need one citizen to manage one tile, well now my citizens manage just one farm tile and 10 unbuild tile while there are plenty of unused farms. Somehow I can't change that.Remember how y'all hate the italians because they conquered all of europe and in best case you want to nuke them?Well, if don't, then you are not a Civ 6 AI since they hate you at 2010 when you had a war with them at 500 bc.Also the new city management leads to the AI spamming troops since they have nothing better to do, but luckily they don't upgrade the units and can't even manage them because they are so much so you can kill their 50 units with one archer in an ideal case (No ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ here).I like some of the new ideas and the new graphics but all for one I enjoyed Civ 5 even more than Civ 6.Also 2k's DLC strategies these days are terrible. Buy Deluxe Editions, receive all the dlcs half a year later and then the game just dies. At least for XCOM2 is that the case. After the last DLC they just stopped working, sometimes a dev get's the order to change a thing or add compatibility but no great changes and I am afraid this will happpen to Civ 6 since Civ 5 vanilla was a mess compared to civ 5 now.Edit: I tried to play as Spain after I wrote this, suddenly Victoria declared war to me without no good reason just 5 rounds after I met her and surprisingly Theodor joined, who was my best friend and on my continent.

Nice addtion to agendas but it didn't make the gameplay and different.

45,416.1,Not Recommended," November 11, 2016",4,"So Ive been playing this game for a while, 55 hours as of writing this, and im really having issues with what to do, thumbs up or down...In the end though, i will not recommend this game, although it has various good points.Plus:-The district system is very nice, forces you to consider placement of future districts and wonder while balancing the recourses nearby.-Wonders requiring a tile is smart, gives you more of a penalty if you dont finish while also taking a tile from your city if you do.-The civics tree is interesting, culture in general feels much more immersive and competative than before.-The earning of great people allows for you to play in alot of different ways and screw over your opponents by taking something that they could use.-Combat units are balanced.-The addition of projects let you produce something of worth when no buildings are available instead of just units, gold or science.Minus:-Religious victory is completely overpowered, especially in pve games. its too easy to take over another Civ with religion, especially if that Civ isnt specifically aiming for that victory.-There arent enough great works slots. especially for the Writers, there is 1 spot in an aphitheater for each city, other than that, you need wonders, which makes writers useless, especially considering they produce 2-3 pieces each.-Leader and civilization powers are weirdly specific and sometimes useless. The powers need you to have or do some very specific things that are sometimes very bad. for example, Russias leader Peter has the ability to receive ekstra science and culture from traderoutes with Civ that are more advanced than them. This means that to make greatest use of this leader, 2 victory conditions have been eliminated.-Amenities, Housing and Population. on paper it seems smart but in reality, housing and amenities stop the player from settling alot of places early in the game simply because they wont result in anything, and when playing against high level AI, early settling is key. its also not well explained what ""entertainment"" is in the game, as the ""entertainment complex"" district says it gives amenities from different sources of ""entertainment"".-Not alot of map options so far, it was okay in civ 5 after all the expansions but to have this little option and with very few ways of controlling how the map will form? not good.-No way to play co-op. Civ 5 had a broken way of playing co-op but at least you could still do it, here, you have no actual way of playing any real co-op, which really makes it uninteresting to do.And lastly, the big issue that everyone is annoyed with:-AI. So many new things in Civ 6 were based on giving AI an overhaul and give them personality and agenda. which they did. they just all have the same, almost immidiately denounce, go to war for petty reasons, rinse repeat. There are so many more issues with AI but this review is long enough."

If you are a fan of the CIV series then you might not like this one as much. They basically overhauled a vast majority of the game and changed up a lot of things. They tend to do that with each one but honestly this one wasn't even relatively close to CIV 4 and CIV 5. Which deeply saddens me because I've put well over 500 hours in CIV 5 alone.

What i discovered having it set on a harder level doesnt make the AI better, just gives them a s h i t ton of bonuses at the start of the game.There have been some interesting concepts they brought in that i liked, but didnt capitilize on encorporating previous editions of Civilization into it. Overall this game gets boring after a few goes and is repetitive, due to poor AI build into game. I wonder if Sid Meier had produced it how it would turn out?, being the original game developer. ( I know it would have been amazing) Very disapointed, after such high expectations for civilization."

Played a little of Civ 2 and LOTS of Civ 3. Civ 4 was OK, Civ 5 was better. Civ 6? Disappointing.The main issue is the AI. Everything you do or don't do will inspire the AI to declare war on you. There's no way to avoid war or attempt any sort of peaceful win.Add to that, it seems to be poorly optimized. During the later game I would have to wait 1-2 minutes or more between turns. And this was when it was just me and one other civ left. I would have been bored to death if I wasn't watching a show at the same time. And no, it's not that my computer is♥♥♥♥♥♥ my computer isn't amazing but it's definitely mid quality for a gaming rig.I'm sure that after the expansions come out the game will be better. But that will be another $60-100, unless you're willing to wait till the prices drop...

105,37.5,Not Recommended," October 28, 2016",4,"In it's current state I can't recommend this game.The AI is absolutely horrible. My first game I went for a domination victory. Late game when I had tanks, AT crews, helicopters etc. I was still fighting horsemen and spearmen, which just made it completely boring.The AI also keeps breaking promises and there is no penalty for them doing so. For example, England started to convert my cities and I naturally told her to stop and she agreed. But the very next turn she continues to convert my cities. At this point I would like to atleast recieve a casus belli with little warmonger penalty, as she was the one to break her promise.Similar thing happend in the same game but with China. He settled a city very close to my capital, so I told him not to settle near me in the futere, he agreed. A couple of turns later I decide to settle a city myself, so I thought that I wouldn't settle west of my capital as that is where China is and that would be kind of double standard to settle close to him, just when I told him not to settle too close to me. So I decided to go east but sure enough once I created my city, he got mad at me for settling too close to him.I also have some smaller issues with the game that I can live with, but I would like to see them getting fixed.The game itself doesn't run very well. I can run The Witcher 3 at around medium-high settings, but in this game my FPS will start to drop heavily around mid-late game.And finally I can't close this game normally without my PC completely freezing. I have to force close it everytime.Now this game also have some huge improvements since Civ 5 such as combat, city planning and more.When they start updating this game, I'll hopefully be able to change this review to positive."

Also when upgrading it was easier when you could just list units. The times I have played so far it seems impossible to get to the high level technologies before game over. Yes the graphics are beautiful and I like how you can combine units, but the gameplay just isn't up to that of Civ V. One thing I wish that they would introduce is what they had in an earlier version (Civ 3??) where you can build an outpost - afterall, who builds a city in the middle of an icy area to utilise that single resource!!!

465,56.9,Not Recommended," February 23, 2017",4,"Well, my recommendation to you is to keep on playing Civ 5.There are some tiny things which bother me:Cities can't be upgraded anymore in a depth that I would like to have, you have 1 or 2 buildings in the city and the rest is standing arround the city, that makes the city looks pity and also takes the depth of ""build a big city where tourist come and go""Now every wonder, even the small ones just stand on a tile, they could've made a great change, wonders like the Ruhr Valley have to get one special tile, wonders like the Brandenburger Gate stand in the city.Also the tile managment is a bit confusing. You need one citizen to manage one tile, well now my citizens manage just one farm tile and 10 unbuild tile while there are plenty of unused farms. Somehow I can't change that.Remember how y'all hate the italians because they conquered all of europe and in best case you want to nuke them?Well, if don't, then you are not a Civ 6 AI since they hate you at 2010 when you had a war with them at 500 bc.Also the new city management leads to the AI spamming troops since they have nothing better to do, but luckily they don't upgrade the units and can't even manage them because they are so much so you can kill their 50 units with one archer in an ideal case (No ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ here).I like some of the new ideas and the new graphics but all for one I enjoyed Civ 5 even more than Civ 6.Also 2k's DLC strategies these days are terrible. Buy Deluxe Editions, receive all the dlcs half a year later and then the game just dies. At least for XCOM2 is that the case. After the last DLC they just stopped working, sometimes a dev get's the order to change a thing or add compatibility but no great changes and I am afraid this will happpen to Civ 6 since Civ 5 vanilla was a mess compared to civ 5 now.Edit: I tried to play as Spain after I wrote this, suddenly Victoria declared war to me without no good reason just 5 rounds after I met her and surprisingly Theodor joined, who was my best friend and on my continent.

15,130.2,Not Recommended, January 6,4,"If you play civilization games casually, you shouldn't have a problem with this installment. However, if you're looking for an immersive and engaging experience, buy civ 5 on sale instead.There are so many aspects about this game that are incredibly rushed and unbalanced. On harder difficulties, you feel as if you're playing catchup the entire time- the AI doesn't play stronger, they merely receive massive bonuses that put them hopelessly ahead until later in the game. The AI also rarely upgrades their military units, preferring instead to create new ones. It is common to fight against archers and infantry in the modern age. This breaks any sense of immersion you might have remaining after Ghandi condemns you for not having nuclear weapons in 1500 BC.In addition to all of This, civ 6 lacks any diplomatic victory option, completely restricting an entire arena of play that was very fun.My final compliant is that the developers refuse to patch even basic bugs and instead expect players to buy DLC to fix these problems. It's flat out greedy and is a giant middle finger to devoted players.There are a few things about this game that I like, however. It is far easier to look at than previous civ games and won't give you a headache if you play it too long. The UI and civic trees are innovative and easy to use but they lack depth. The district system is fantastic and causes players to focus on one specific playstyle. I also love that traders create their own roads although it is frustrating that this is the only way to build them in the early game. The relationship tabs between nations is also much clearer than in previous games but also lacks depth- there are only a couple of ways to improve diplomatic relations and these have a very limited effect.Overall, I'd give civ 6 a 2/5. Although initially fun and engaging, it completely falls apart after you see through it's pretty facade. Don't waste your $ until civ 7 is released."
131,409.1,Recommended," May 3, 2017",406,"I'm posting this because I've just spotted all the negative reviews.I'm old enough to have pre-ordered Civ I in the days when that meant going into a shop, I've played every version and variant since, and I think Civ VI is *deep breath* the best Civ ever.Let me explain why.Civ I is a timeless classic. Civ II and its expansions and forks set a new high bar and showed where Civ could go. Civ III was all about trying new things, but whilst I liked it from the start it really needed the Conquests expansion to bring the new systems together, and even then they were still a bit ropey. Civ IV was, until now, my all time favourite, and the BtS expansion is easily the best Civ expansion pack ever. The depth of strategy and systems, and a slightly fussy interface, mean it's not a great one for first-timers, but the joy of Civ is in understanding how everything works as well as using it.Civ V, however, was dire. The vanilla version was so dumbed down I was completing games in three evenings without really thinking about them, and although the expansions helped a lot it still felt like it belonged more on a console (no offence to console gamers but the reason you invest in a super-fast CPU is for games like Civ).So, knowing that a lot of Civ V's systems were to be ported to VI, along with the new map and city systems that bear a striking resemblance to Endless Legend, I wasn't sure what to expect, and the hefty price tag on the full fat version almost made it the first version I haven't pre-ordered.However! From the first seconds of the beautiful opening sequence I knew this was going to be something a bit special, possibly even as good as Civ IV. The greatest Civs (I, II, IV, forget the forks) are those where all the systems from the map, through city management, to science, diplomacy, religion and war, all work together. Where they jar against each other (III) you end up being forced into making nonsensical decisions and it breaks the immersion. Civ VI, with some early teething problems, absolutely nails this.The map is the star, and the new strategic fulcrum of the game. Firaxis did well to flatter Endless Legend, and there are other parallels that made me worry this would be too much like it, but this is still very distinctively a Civ game. And some people don't like the cartoony style, but I do because it evokes Civ I, we can agree to differ.The new city building system, also borrowed from Endless Legend, works exactly how it should do. It takes a little while to learn how to exploit it to the maximum, but then if you want something you can master in a couple of playthroughs then Civ isn't the game for you. The science system has thankfully been un-dumbed from Civ V and the structure of the tech tree has some nice nods back to Civs I and II, and the eureka system adds a bit more fun. Religion, one of the better systems in V, has largely been ported from it, and now fits better with the other systems. And culture is a similarly good port, although the culture victory is far too easy (turn if off if you're definitely going for any other victory condition).The two weaker systems were war and diplomacy, but the patches and DLC have done a lot to fix the balancing issues - even though at the moment I'd still rather not start near China (and for those wondering, Ghandi is still a warmongering ****). It's still not 100% perfect, but no system in any Civ game ever was (anyone remember diplomats in Civ I?), the point is that they all work together in a way that only the best Civs manage.So why does it have the edge over Civ IV? Partly because the visuals and sound are beautiful - the main music in the game is the traditional song Hard Times Come Again No More, and I love the way it develops into a crescendo in the late game. And partly because the late game is now worth slogging through - and yes, the cinematic ending and stats have been restored. The new map adds to the fun to be had here, so rather than just rushing towards your choice of world-ending weapon it's actually worth building a balanced force, even if you're not going for a domination victory. And it's also worth building thermonuclear weapons even just to try one and reload just to see the pretty new fireworks.So as a Civ veteran I'd say ignore the negative reviews. If you're a long time fan who wished Civ V had never happened then you should find all is forgiven. If you're new to the series then just be aware that you're making a long term investment - Civ is supposed to towards the harder end of 4X strategies but it's nowhere near as impenetrable as it seems at first. Take a few games to learn it and keep experimenting until you find a playing style that suits you.Civ VI claims the Civ crown, and reclaims its place as the best 4X ever."
18,104.9,Recommended," October 23, 2016",87,"At first, I was very skeptical of the graphics. Everything looked very ""cartoonish."" Once I started playing, however, I immediately fell in love. The graphics actually make the game very playable by not taking too much processing power. Sometimes 5 and even Beyond Earth became too frustrating to play those larger games with more computer/human players. The Civ team was very smart in not putting too much effort into the graphics by making sure this is playable on most hardware, even making it simple enough to easily put it on a mobile platform.As for game mechanics, this version introduces a lot and re-introduces what we love about previous versions. New to the franchise, they brought districts to the map, limited actions for builders, policy card decks, envoys, super enhanced diplomacy, and culture ""researching."" Then they made sure to include features that I love about previous versions like religion, choosing government, rebels, trade, and natural wonders. This makes the base game already feel really complete. It's hard to imagine what they might include in the expansions, other than new civs and maps. Or maybe I'm just blindsighted at how awesome the game already is.For long time Civilization players, this is the game we've always wanted."
80,307.7,Recommended," March 17, 2017",170,"I'm not one for leaving reviews, but I feel this game deserves some praise. While the game isn't perfect, I feel the amount of negativity surrounding other reviews isn't a fair assessment of the game. There are some loyal, passionate and long-time customers of the franchise. Civ V being regarded as such a fantastic and well balanced game, shouldn't cause negative reviews for the newest installment in the series.I think the developers made some fantastic changes to the game, while sticking to it's roots. Districts are an interesting addition to the game and I like the way Builders are used in this installment. The Technology Tree and it's Eureka moments add another layer of strategy not found in it's predecessor. Some of the Government Policy cards could use some balancing, as I often tend to use the same over and over. However, as I've played with other civs and altered my playstyle, I find myself using cards that I hadn't in the past.Sure, the AI behaves a bit odd and is something that can be easily beaten as you settle-in to the new mechanics. They also have some strange behaviors. These are not game-breaking issues and something that I'm confident that will continue to be balanced in future patches. I honestly think these minor annoyances are the reason for the negative reviews. Just because something isn't perfect, doesn't make it bad. Patches have already been introduced to adjust AI behavior while in the meantime, Steam Workshop mods have been opened up (one of which is an AI improvement mod).At the end of the day, the game still gives me that ""one more turn"" feeling. I'll make a mental note that I want to wrap things up, and 2 hours later I'm still playing. If that isn't the qualifier for a solid game, I don't know what is."

Most new systems should be able to run it very smoothly.Players who have plaved civ 5 and are familier with the other games in the series will find this game to be a marked improvemnt in1) smoothness of gameplay-- this runs smoothly and with more FPS than Civ 5.. improved Multicore support of CPU with Direct X 12 also certainly helps.2) Visual graphics are much better.3) the game has some improvements in gameplay.. will write a detailed review on that later after more gameplay.It has improvements in the number of resources, different types of resources, barbarian units have started scouting also,Goverment type screen and associated bonuses has been introduced and its much more streamlined (replaces the earlier screen of culture based bonuses) , they way to interact with city states has changed. Research tree is much better.Cons1) One thing I did not like was that it is not easy to Auto explore as earlier. Also could not find the button to promote a unit after it gains experience easily, the developlers should do something to fix it in the patches.2) Game is overpriced as with all sidmeier games, that also prevents me fro playing many other games in the series. 2 K game/ Firfaxis should have priced at atleast 35 % lower. Also I can bet that the DLC's coming out will be sold seperately and at a high cost. Also its unlikely that this game wil go on discount anytime soon.For players who are new to to Civilization series.This is one of the best Turn based strategy games out there. The learning curve is also not very steep.In short: Go for the Game, if the price is not a deterrance.Will write a more detailed review later."

41,44.7,Not Recommended," October 21, 2016",14,"Having played all the games in the Civilization franchise, I've never been as disappointed or frustrated with a Civilization game before as I am with Civilization VI. I had expected something more from a game that claims to have a new game engine and add a lot of features on top of Civilization V.Not only does the game completely fail to add anything, that wasn't a part of Civilization V, it even keeps all the frustrating elements of Civlization V. In some respects, I think, the frustrating elements have only gotten worse.For example, I've never enjoyed City States and routinely play Civilization V without them. Starting a game without them in Civilization VI is not even an option. I strongly disliked them because they were too easy to farm XP on for units, and the bonuses you got for courting them were far too strong. The XP farming hasn't been fixed and the bonuses are now even more powerful.Another example is the Diplomacy options: While animated leaders with native voiceacting could have been a nice touch, both Civilization V and VI fails to follow through, since the audio doesn't match the text on screen. That the other world leaders are even more random and psychotic than in Civilization V, does not help either. The illusion, that you are negotiating with a human, fails horribly when wars are declared or ended for no reason or any reason and the animated leader you're talking to is saying something different than the subtitles (or is saying nothing). Furthermore the world leaders will nag you incessantly for any reason they choose. You can decline their offer of peace for a 100 times in a row, but they will still nag you for peace every 5 turns (no kidding!) if they're loosing the idiotic war they started for no reason.Third example: Religion still functions in much the same way. The different beliefs and their mechanics are even identical to the ones in Civilization V, as are mechanics for spreading the religions, actively with preachers and passively through proximity and trade.Actually, to be fair, the game does bring a little news to the game. The mechanics with city districts and wonders being placed on the map makes the city building a little more interesting, but in my opinion it gets completely drowned out by the fact that the worst elements of Civilization V is still around. Or more precisely; that you're still playing Civilization V.Because that's the truth of it: Civilization VI is the same as Civilization V.The AI unit control is just as horrible. The City States are just as overpowered. The AI leaders are just as random. Religion spreads the same way. With very few, and forgettable, exceptions the game is the same.I would recommend against this game.EDIT: (Above was written on 6-7 hours of gameplay.)Allright, now I've played through the one and only game of Civilization VI that I will ever complete. Huge Map, Marathon, Standard difficulty. Game is way too easy and it's all too obvious that the game engine HAS NOT changed, even though it was a selling point.Just like the very forgettable Beyond Earth, Civilization VI will go straight to the dustbin of failed games. If anyone startes a petition for refunds, let me know.The AI will happily declare war against you with it's rag tag army of mediveal henchmen, even though you have Modern Armour Armies (note the plural) in striking range of their capital.The game is balanced wrong. You NEVER need to build Theatre og Campus districts. As in NEVER EVER. You can get all the culture and science you need from Monuments, Population and Trade Routes. Never waste production on a district if it isn't Harbour, Commercial, Aquaduct, Recreation, Residential or Industrial.On the other hand, you are going to spend the entire game starved for production, so build Industrial Districts ASAP and use gold whenever possible to rush construcion, and thus save production for those things that can't be bought. (Wonders, Projects, Districts)Basically, Districts are a no-brainer. There is never need og use for doing anything other than producing Industrial and Commerce/Harbour first and then Aquaduct/Residential/Recreation when the city grows. Never build a Campus, Encampment or Theatre. You DON'T need them.No-brainers are bad game design, basically.Also; infinite city sprawl is back. Since happiness is now a purely local affair, you can and should cover every square inch of the map in cities. There is no downside. Even though you pay a little upkeep per city, the expense is insignificant comparet to the per-city income that acrues from the +1/+2 trade routes you can maintain per city (through Commercial/Harbour districts).More no-brainers. More bad game design.The extreme lag that Civilization V suffered from is still around, which means that for the last 100+ turns. I've waited 3-5min per game round, even on a high end gamer PC. The game took >40 hours, but I'm sure I could have completed it in <10 hours if it wasn't for the extreme lag.What the actual f***?"

And Civilization 6 breaks this rule. The only important gameplay feature which was presented in Civ5 but has been cut in Civ6 is UN. And also Civ6 introduced many new features!City districts is pretty interesting feature. It still should be polished but I already like itWonders which takes it's own cell are very good.

133,48.0,Recommended," January 31, 2017",8,"This game has done a wonderful job setting itself apart from previous entries thanks to some significant revamps. The most obvious changes came from diplomacy. It's much more intricate and realistic, though a number of AI actions still don't make much sense. But, it's far more dependent on how the player reacts as opposed to the AI programming, and that's a huge step forward for the franchise. The next big change is the districts mechanic. The series standard has been to cram all your buildings and wonders in the city proper. Now you can build different districts (such as science, culture, commerce, etc) and wonders onto their own hexes. This makes managing your space far more important and also makes even the most passive players have to consider putting in some work on their military as AIs in particular like to use hit and run tactics on those spaces when you're at war. I don't think the franchise has ever looked better, and it's a good thing because the soundtrack, while good, doesn't quite live up to the glorious standards of Civ V. Thanks to this game's numerous tweaks and balances and bold revamping of major mechanics, this should be a must buy for any strategy fans and an inivitation to return to those who felt jilted by Beyond Earth."

The UI is not streamlined at all and the game will waste your time, especially when your empire gets bigger and older. Best example is the ""Future Tech"" research. The game will ask you to choose it every couple of turns. At that point there is nothing else to choose, so why ask me over and over and over again? The same is true for cities who are maxed out, you still have to choose something every couple of turns. The fire-and-forget options of ""give me gold/research until I change it"" of former Civs is gone.And of course, again, the AI is half brain dead. This is true for troops movement on the map and also the ""diplomacy"" stuff.While a good AI is hard to do, most of the other stuff is easily fixable. So why is it here, at release, at full price?Before the worst problems are patched, I cannot recommend the game to anyone. Maybe except hardcore Civ fans?"

So unlike older versions, you need to think how to develop and focus your cities in a way that support your overall strategy. This is great.Unfortunately, there is a lot of just stupid things that contr-balance it all. Annoying ""rumors"" about your own actions, animations you just need to wait through, endless friendships requests or denounces, non-sensical AI behavior. It feels like people producing the game where collecting mechanics, but not designing the game flow and player experience. You end up with crazy things like pacifist Gandhi bothering you in middle ages about his Nukes agenda. Just random nonsense that hard to follow.CIvilization games never had any historical sense, but it was possible to follow at least some story (and even enjoy replay on a minimap at the end). This version is just a mix of smart and not so smart mechanics that glue together with terrible AI and without much care for a meaningless game progression."

Anyone who knows the Civ franchise should also know that you'll never be able to make a decision on about the game until long after the 2 hour Steam refund timer is up. So I keep playing despite myself. I have yet to complete a single game though, and I wonder if I'll ever really enjoy it without massive overhauls from modders.

There isn't much available on Fanatics, and there still is no steam community page as of the end of 2016.)(Additional personal aside) - I thought I would love Sean Bean as the narrator but nearly every quote is juvenile and silly.

151,27.5,Recommended," June 24, 2017",5,"I have been playing Civ since Civ 1 when your settlers could get 'lost' randomly and disappear off the map. I don't have a count for the hours played in Civ 2 or Civ 3 and I have over 300 hours clocked on Civ 5. I do get the criticisms that people have of Civ 6 right now, but if you compare Civ 6 to Civ 5 and its first DLC Civ 6 still has far more advance mechanisms such as the role religion plays, how you recruit great people, the fact wonders take up tiles and each of the 'districts'. They've essentially added urban planning to this game which is a first in the franchise really beyond roads and 'improvements'. In short there is a TON of new gameplay over Civ 5 even with all of Civ 5's dlcs. I also prefer the lack of penalty for expanding your Civ in terms of city building like they did in Civ 5 with the stupid ""happiness"" counter, it is much more realistic in Civ6 in that it is more of a matter if you are able to support and grow that city.That being said, issues I have would be the somewhat irrational computers in terms of diplomacy and roads are much more difficult to establish which is vexxing since the early ones use trade routes to make roads and military engineers later.With all that being said Civ 6 is 100% more complete than Civ 5 was on release and I look forward to seeing expansions rather than these piddly over priced faction releases."

Civilization VI is the latest installment in the Civilization Franchise.If you're not then skip to the review.The GoodThe graphical fidelity and attention to detail is excellent.The game is very moddable and there are a ton of mods out already with hundreds more in the pipeline.There are thousands of hours of content in this game if you are looking for something you can keep around for a while then this may fill that gap.The game is different from previous games, which makes it feel fresh and interesting.The BadThere are occasional performance issues, with stuttering and flickering. It comes and goes depending on the patch.The mods that are available are not yet done through the steam workshop which is a problem, as it makes it a bit harder to access them.The modding tools also haven't been fully released yet which is a mark against the game in its current form in my opinion.The game is different from previous games, which can make it feel a bit unbalanced and unfamiliar.The UglyThe AI is quite poor and weak and not particularly fun to play against and multiplayer games take 6-12hours.You can't make teams in multiplayer, without editing the game files, so you can't have co-op games with friends. This will probably be fixed in the future!Closing comment:I would say that the game does a good job of keeping the familiar old gameplay whilst changing it up with new mechanics and a new direction. I would definitely say, if you are a civ fanatic then GET THIS GAME. If you're a new comer to the series and you're more exploratory, I would WAIT until a major sale(40-60%) so that the game has time to mature and new content put into it[It has only been 2 months since release and two content updates have been released.]This review was written on the Winter 2016 Patch of the game.

168,26.8,Not Recommended," October 27, 2016",5,"I can almost mark my life as to when each new installment of civ has come out. I have devoted thousands of hours since the first days of good old civ 1. Each was a vast improvment over the previous until civ 5 came out. It clearly missed the mark and the devs should have learned their lesson and rebooted. Alas, it isn't so based upon the boring mess that is civ 6. There are so many things missing and just plain done bady I hardly know where to begin... I won't bore you with a list of peeves, but here are a few: no ""sentry"" function for units (they either fortify or sleep). An enemy unit can (and does) walk right up to the unit and pillage the nearby tile. All you may get is a little icon on the side showing that enemies are in your territory. Spies are a huge pain in the butt as you have to reasign them every few turns by clicking through a whole process of seemingly pointless and few ""actions"". Even then your districts will frequently keep getting pillaged requiring several turns of rebuilding even if a spy is assigned to counterspying. There are too many options that require tiles to build so that having a truly great city is difficult at best because you quickly run out of room to build and still keep up with food production and housing. The housing is broken from the start as you will early on continuously get warnings that more housing is needed, more housing is needed, more hous.... etc. (PLEBES NEEDED!).I expect the faithful gaming community will do the devs jobs for them and fix what is woefully broken, develop mods, and (hopefully) create entire total conversions that might make this game worth playing. As it has been released it is not only not worth $60 it isn't worth $30... I assume the pressure was on to release this game far too early and there just was not enough time to do it justice. A big reason I assume that time was a huge factor is the fact that not a single scenario or extra bit of additional content was released with the game. Huh??!!My advice to the devs is this: if you cannot do civ right then please do not do it and send this game to others who will treat it with the respect that it rightly deserves. My second piece of advice to the devs is: on a fundemental level you need to admit that civ 5 was a mistake and scrap that entire line of thinking and go back and rebuild/ reboot an entirely new concept for the civ series (usng civ 4 and the many terrific mods as a jumping off point). Because you have not admitted that civ 5 was a mistake, you have created a pile of garbage with civ 6 that did not need to be so. Poor clay produces even worse bricks and this series will keep getting worse and worse if it does not catch itself, admit and own up to its recent mistakes and get back to the greatness that stayed with civ 4 and it's predecessors. This game is boring, basic, and even more cartoony than 5 which was bad enough..."

344,59.3,Not Recommended," October 24, 2016",5,"I cannot honestly recommend Civ VI in its current state :- AI is bipolar, declaring war on you for no reason, two turns after declaring you their BFF and whatnot, and still cannot make smart strategic decisions. You can curbstomp them even if you are behind in tech. They do not protect their setllers, and diplomacy is utterly bonkers.- Districts are an intersting mechanic, but gone horribly wrong. You cannot relocate them, and it is nearly impossible to optimize every one of them. Did I mention they often cost more than wonders when you get past renaissance era ?- Barbarians are a constant threat, even more so than AIs. They tech up too fast, and I had more trouble with one barbarian camp than with 2 neighboring civs.- One of the greatest joys of Civ games, building your own little peaceful empire, is gone. Like it or not, you WILL have to produce an endless stream of militay units, just to defend from constant raiding by barbarians in early game, and warring AIs throwing low tech units at you.- UI is a mess. Lots of things are gone from Civ V, hidden behind several buttons. Happiness and Religion spreading are nigh incomprehensible, for example.Now I know that is is a freshly released game, and I sincerely hope that through testing, balancing and patching, Firaxis can deliver us something akin to Civ IV Beyond the Sword or Civ V Brave New World."
806,41.9,Recommended," October 21, 2016",5,"I only managed to put in an hour on release night but I can already tell this Civilization is the best yet. For anyone that is concerned about getting this game at launch because ""it won't be complete"" like Civ V was - fear not. This game includes virtually everything that Civ V has after 2 expansions, and then some.The new visuals are beautiful and make it much easier to tell what is happening on the map when you've got a bunch of units and improvements. ""unstacking the city"" was a genius move and I can already see the gameplay potential and strategical challenges that will arise from this. Splitting the civics tree and the tech tree was also genius. Music is incredible. The removal of global happiness is great - going ""wide"" is viable again!I have thousands of hours in the Civ genre from Civ III onwards. I expect I will put in a thousand more with CIV VI. Will update once I get some more hours and experience the ""late game.""*Update* I have finished my first game after ~20 hours. It was a ""small"" 6 player map, standard speed. I ended up going for the Science victory. The victory conditions are awesome - they feel familiar but are unique from Civ V (Except for Domination, which is the same, obviously). The AI isn't perfect, it has some issues, but the game is still very fun. Late game turns move a little slow similar to Civ V, but that is to be expected when so much is going on around the map. The separate districts you create within your cities really are an incredibly positive change to the gameplay. I just wish that as your cities grow they would visually spill into other tiles, merge together and create a ""supercity"" of sorts rather than each district looking like a contained unit in itself. This would be especially cool with the Neighborhood districts."
302,713.5,Not Recommended," October 21, 2016",5,"Played it for 11 hours; wanted to be as objective as possible about whether or not the game was worth it.Overall, there are several design features which look like improvements over the base game, but which have flaws that become apparent about halfway through the game. The card-based government system is a novel concept, but doesn't allow for more freedom; the majority of the options presented are terrible, while the rest are so situationally effective (based on what victory type you're attempting to win with) that there really isn't any choice at all. Parallel research and culture tracks are interesting, but victory type largely tailors your research/culture research paths down a pretty straight line. Hidden civ AI agendas appear to make AIs appear unpredictable, but their behaviors are still pretty predictable, and grow entirely predictable after you discover what their hidden agenda is. Civilizations offer drastically different powers, but are wildly imbalanced, and many of them are close to useless. And so on, and so forth - the game's features offer the illusion of choice, but optimized play involves linear paths that grow tedious after approximately the medieval era.Furthermore, there are two other major drawbacks, which are:1. Some technical functions are still buggy. Path tracing will incorrectly register hovering over locations as movement to said locations, which can lead to disadvantageous positioning (or poor combat, which can be disasterous during war). Autoexplore defaults to redundant paths and is effectively unusable. Nothing game-breaking, but annyoing and warranting of the sort of micromanagement that isn't enjoyable.2. The game is enjoyable through roughly the first 100 turns, where decisions feel meaningful and victory could go any which way. After that point, a winner has largely been determined, and the rest of the game feels like ""going through the motions,"" and largely not worth playing. As a result, several features implemented with the game - from tourism to espionage and more - are almost vestigial because of how little they impact the parts of the game that matter.Overall, the game feels reasonably playable, and somewhat fun, but certainly not as breathtaking as one might expect from a virtually AAA title. The game might be worth purchasing at $20, but i certainly wouldn't pay $60 for it, much less $80. If you're a devoted fan of the franchise, wait until it goes on sale; if you aren't, this is a largely passable title"

199,45.8,Recommended," June 26, 2017",5,"I recommended this game. Yes, this game have huge different features and mechanism compared to previous CIVs, but they put some great potential features. If you just want the ""feature added"", it will be bloated of course, and if you just want the ""old features back"", it will be just upgraded graphics.The most feature that I like is the goals tab and other UX improvements. It drives us to focus on our strategy, which kind of victory we planned. Unlike old CIVs which mechanism is somewhat ""hidden"", we need to learn outside the game to figure it out.The second great feature is the victory strategy which improved a lot. Now we can win the game trough military (occupied other players), religious (spreading the religion), culture (tourism), science (launch mars colonialization).The third, district mechanism. This is super awesome! Googling for it if you want details about this feature :DOther positive improvements are:- There is only single ""trader"" for both land and water.- Path are auto-created by creating trading way trough different cities, I liked this so much.- Country specialization now can be shown in game, which I didn't found on previous CIV (did I missed?)- Number of turns left, related to victory by time, is also very good approach on UX side.- No world domination by diplomatic, only on the removed victory strategy is positive for me, but removed united nations at all is not quite a good idea though.- Great works theming (on museum, archeological building, etc.) is so obvious, easy to understand. CIV 5 theming mechanism is too complex.For me, this game is so enjoyable even for new comer which never played old CIVs but also still make sense for old players. The UX improvements are the most great things overall, and so does graphic improvents of course."
25,62.2,Recommended," June 27, 2017",5,"Civ 6 is extremely well-done. As someone who played Civ 4 a ton but skipped Civ 5 (I lost interest in Civ for years and just recently got back into it), there are a number of new features that I really appreciate. Traders, religious and cultural victories, new units and empires, and specialized districts are all really nice additions to the game. And just like any Civ game, ""one more turn"" usually turns into hours at a time spent in game.There are a few things the game could do better. The map-like fog of war loses its novelty quickly and can be kind of annoying, a number of key empires were missing at launch, and the game can be unbearably slow with larger maps. It's also frustrating that single-empire DLC's cost $4.99 when they probably could (and should) have included them in the core game (I got the deluxe version for $15 more and I get free DLC, and I think it's paid for itself already). Additionally, the barbarians are ridiculous if you don't attack the outposts almost immediately; dozens can spawn on a continent in a few turns' time and pillage your improvements and buildings.That being said, I still think this game was worth the money. As for whether or not it's better than Civ 5, I can't speak to that. But I definitely recommend this game to any fans of the Sid Meier's Civilization franchise."

I still believe Civ4 was the overall best game to date with Civ5 a close second. Even with the new expension, which I'm hearing nothing good about, I sadly have to give Civ6 a thumbs down."
168,26.8,Not Recommended," October 27, 2016",5,"I can almost mark my life as to when each new installment of civ has come out. I have devoted thousands of hours since the first days of good old civ 1. Each was a vast improvment over the previous until civ 5 came out. It clearly missed the mark and the devs should have learned their lesson and rebooted. Alas, it isn't so based upon the boring mess that is civ 6. There are so many things missing and just plain done bady I hardly know where to begin... I won't bore you with a list of peeves, but here are a few: no ""sentry"" function for units (they either fortify or sleep). An enemy unit can (and does) walk right up to the unit and pillage the nearby tile. All you may get is a little icon on the side showing that enemies are in your territory. Spies are a huge pain in the butt as you have to reasign them every few turns by clicking through a whole process of seemingly pointless and few ""actions"". Even then your districts will frequently keep getting pillaged requiring several turns of rebuilding even if a spy is assigned to counterspying. There are too many options that require tiles to build so that having a truly great city is difficult at best because you quickly run out of room to build and still keep up with food production and housing. The housing is broken from the start as you will early on continuously get warnings that more housing is needed, more housing is needed, more hous.... etc. (PLEBES NEEDED!).I expect the faithful gaming community will do the devs jobs for them and fix what is woefully broken, develop mods, and (hopefully) create entire total conversions that might make this game worth playing. As it has been released it is not only not worth $60 it isn't worth $30... I assume the pressure was on to release this game far too early and there just was not enough time to do it justice. A big reason I assume that time was a huge factor is the fact that not a single scenario or extra bit of additional content was released with the game. Huh??!!My advice to the devs is this: if you cannot do civ right then please do not do it and send this game to others who will treat it with the respect that it rightly deserves. My second piece of advice to the devs is: on a fundemental level you need to admit that civ 5 was a mistake and scrap that entire line of thinking and go back and rebuild/ reboot an entirely new concept for the civ series (usng civ 4 and the many terrific mods as a jumping off point). Because you have not admitted that civ 5 was a mistake, you have created a pile of garbage with civ 6 that did not need to be so. Poor clay produces even worse bricks and this series will keep getting worse and worse if it does not catch itself, admit and own up to its recent mistakes and get back to the greatness that stayed with civ 4 and it's predecessors. This game is boring, basic, and even more cartoony than 5 which was bad enough..."
344,59.3,Not Recommended," October 24, 2016",5,"I cannot honestly recommend Civ VI in its current state :- AI is bipolar, declaring war on you for no reason, two turns after declaring you their BFF and whatnot, and still cannot make smart strategic decisions. You can curbstomp them even if you are behind in tech. They do not protect their setllers, and diplomacy is utterly bonkers.- Districts are an intersting mechanic, but gone horribly wrong. You cannot relocate them, and it is nearly impossible to optimize every one of them. Did I mention they often cost more than wonders when you get past renaissance era ?- Barbarians are a constant threat, even more so than AIs. They tech up too fast, and I had more trouble with one barbarian camp than with 2 neighboring civs.- One of the greatest joys of Civ games, building your own little peaceful empire, is gone. Like it or not, you WILL have to produce an endless stream of militay units, just to defend from constant raiding by barbarians in early game, and warring AIs throwing low tech units at you.- UI is a mess. Lots of things are gone from Civ V, hidden behind several buttons. Happiness and Religion spreading are nigh incomprehensible, for example.Now I know that is is a freshly released game, and I sincerely hope that through testing, balancing and patching, Firaxis can deliver us something akin to Civ IV Beyond the Sword or Civ V Brave New World."

The Districts system is a bit frustrating, as is the new movement system, the three-time-use builder, and the new agenda system for leaders (which, while I can appreciate it, seems to need improvement, as the leaders seem to not take much more than their agenda into account). All in all, the game itself fulfills the basic game, but misses the mark in terms of improvement and the other issues in the game. I mostly went to Civilization 4 or 5 or even Beyond Earth instead of Civilization 6. I can tell the developers tried in earnest to synthesize the good aspects from those games, such as the diversity in the multitude of leaders and civilizations, as well as intoducing some interesting new features such as Districts, which I personally felt that it instead should have been upgrades for improvements and being able to build cities closer together and being able to use resources that are on the same tile. Ultimately though, this has been my least favorite Civilization game."

Don't settle cities? Denouncement. Don't expand your borders? Denouncement. Expand too much? Denouncement. Grow your army to prevent the IA from attacking? Denouncement. Leave your army small? Denouncement.All this Denouncement eventually leads to the AI to flip out and march to war against you. But if you build a strong military to repel this attack?

254,114.0,Not Recommended," November 17, 2016",5,"This is a hesitant ""no"" for recommendation.The game isn't bad and I believe it has the groundworks to become a great Civ game, given time and expansions.THE BAD:----------As most people have pointed out already the AI is not good. Not only is it extremely hostile towards players unless you follow extremely strict guidelines on how to please it but it's also seemingly even dumber than before when it comes to battle and religion.The strategy seems to be to mass units at the border, with no real thought to which unit goes where, declare war, rush in and unless it wins then and there the war is basically over for the AI. Units will trickle in piecemeal and die in an endless meat grinder, no matter the difficulty.Worse than these though is the graphical readability and the UI. And I'm not talking about the art style, though maybe it is a culprit in itself. It's much harder to quickly get an overview of what's on the screen when overlooking the world, the UI is a hot mess where user flow is atrocious. The Civopedia is extremely lacking, not having info for many concepts or lacking useful info on game mechanics.The fog of war, while looking nice and stylish at first, is a nightmare to look at to figure out what lies beneath it (after you've discovered the area but don't have vision).After a few hours of all this I notice major eye-fatigue which no Civ game before has given me.The game is also ""clunky"". This is hard to describe but think of it as the ease of control and the smooth flowing of the game. Most things are a bit of a hassle, even moving units feels somewhat stuttering sometimes. Shortcuts lack for almost everything, 5 clicks are needed where one should suffice etc. This ties in to the poor use flow for UI I talked about earlier.Tying into the clunkiness is the endless, pointless, notifications that you get spammed with or the horrendeously slow leader screens (who like the rest of the game suffer from atrocious UI).Movement. Opinions are split on this one, understandably. I can certainly see where they come from but the change to movements make military units like infantry absolute trash. It's a change which feels more tedious than anything.Lastly, and extremely subjectivem the graphical style (as opposed to readability). This is a contentious one and might not apply. I personally don't enjoy it as it has become too cartoony for me, a bit xbox live. Forests lack that nice, dense feeling and I have a harder time getting lost into the fantasy of controlling a world.THE GOOD:------------Governments and civics have really taken a turn for the better. Very interesting and potentially deep with enough possible variance to keep you interested for a long while. My favorite aspect of the game.Districts/Wonders using tiles. This imposes a dilemma for the player of how to use the tiles and what to sacrifice for a city since you can no longer be a master of all. They need some major balancing, and perhaps some things shouldn't be districts, but overall this change is great.Cities can use the ocean if a water tile is within it's borders. This I have been dreaming of since the very first Civ. Praise the sun!IN SUMMARY:--------------Needs major overhaul many things, I have vague hopes this can happen through both expansions and mods. There are good concepts lurking beneath what I feel to be an incomplete game."

Though the city building aspect was mostly well done, the learn curve is a bit steep. Firaxis didn't help matters with its last patch which nerfed costal city benefits.Among the aggrivations:-Diplomacy somehow managed to regress even further from previous entries. It's quite useless actually.-The reappearance of religion is fine and all, it'd just be nice if the AI didn't spam the heck out of religion units to the point where it hinders movement of your own units.-On the subject of the AI, I'm sure through many of the comments you're already well aware of the infamous warmonger metric. It's completely broken and illogical. There's nothing quite like being attacked by multiple Civs, retaliating by capturing one of their cities, and being labeled a warmonger for,.............pretty much the entire game where no other Civ likes you. That's right. No matter the number of turns, you're hated all around the world for seemingly no reason whatsoever. This leads back to why diplomacy is useless in this game.-Did I mention AI spam? Yes, well unfortunately that goes for cities too. They'll happily spam cities near your borders even after you ask them to stop and they agree. It's a cheap ploy to instigate war, lame. Not that war is difficult anyway since the AI is so terrible at it.-Don't bother building a navy, the AI sure doesn't.Bottom line, this game is nearly unplayable in its current state after two major patches. The AI sucks, the Civ penalties make no sense, and the warmonger penalty needs to be either fixed or scrapped entirely. Say what you want about Civ V, but it's a masterpiece compared to this trainwreck. Perhaps I could recommend this game after an expansion pack, but now? No way."

It is genuinely fun to 'learn to civ' again for the x'th time, but bugs, features that you'd expect strangely missing, an especially helpless AI for the opponent Leaders as well as blatant exploits gradually do their part in making the whole exercise increasingly pointless.Great game. Needs a great deal of bugs and exploits fixed. As well as features missing from V put back into VI making it part of the next DLC, thank you very much. It also needs said improvements incoming sooner rather than later, as I feel I've completely wasted the last 15-20 hours I put into the game after bugs ruined the goal of victory I had been working towards since the start. Don't see myself picking this title up again until it is in a better condition. Huge let down, at this price point you expect a game to be released in a much better shape than this.While the single player AI soon becomes annoying to deal with to the point you soon stop caring to even read what they say when they contact you, Civ VI in multiplayer has so far been a great experience. We had some occational disconnects during the first days after launch, but have not experienced any multiplayer specific game stopping bugs or desyncs.Still gonna recommend the game though, its very fun despite all the flaws and shortcomings I whine about.

Let me explain:When I first played Civ 6, I didn't like the cartoonish art, was not a fan of the new builder mechanic and didn't like the monotonously colored map aka fog of war. I played several hours and then, to my delight, I started to understand the builder simplicity, appreciated the new art style. The new map style I still hated however. I finally started to get it.But, after dozens of hours of play, I couldn't ignore the painfully broken AI with completely random wars, behaviors and the strangest “friend” requests. They'll ask you to be your friend and suddenly DOW your butt. There are so many weird issues that I simply can't list them all here but to name a few more: the AI rarely attacks you after a DOW, does not defend it's positions at all and sometimes will nag you every turn for things like alliances which just slows the game down. AI has always been the worst part of the Civ series but it seems to be at its worst in the newest Civ game. There are also some graphical bugs but the game is still fairly new so I can ignore these.What really made me dislike Civ 6 however, was not particularly its flaws, but it was when I returned to Civ 5 and realized just how much of step back Civ 6 is. Everything from the map detail to color pallete (there seems to be a really nice contrast in Civ 5) to the game interface seemed “better”.I can't recommend this latest Civ game at its current stage but I hope that future add ons for it will help it “evolve” such as G&K and BNW did for Civ 5.

I played several hours and then, to my delight, I started to understand the builder simplicity, appreciated the new art style. The new map style I still hated however. I finally started to get it.But, after dozens of hours of play, I couldn't ignore the painfully broken AI with completely random wars, behaviors and the strangest “friend” requests. They'll ask you to be your friend and suddenly DOW your butt. There are so many weird issues that I simply can't list them all here but to name a few more: the AI rarely attacks you after a DOW, does not defend it's positions at all and sometimes will nag you every turn for things like alliances which just slows the game down. AI has always been the worst part of the Civ series but it seems to be at its worst in the newest Civ game. There are also some graphical bugs but the game is still fairly new so I can ignore these.What really made me dislike Civ 6 however, was not particularly its flaws, but it was when I returned to Civ 5 and realized just how much of step back Civ 6 is. Everything from the map detail to color pallete (there seems to be a really nice contrast in Civ 5) to the game interface seemed “better”.I can't recommend this latest Civ game at its current stage but I hope that future add ons for it will help it “evolve” such as G&K and BNW did for Civ 5. In the meantime, I do highly recommend that you pick up Civ 5 and see for yourself the points I have outlined above."

307,20.4,Not Recommended," October 28, 2016",5,"Unpolished, lacking in features, and even the features present are not well presented or explained. Tech tree feels a lot more empty now than ever before. It feels like they got rid of old features like 'health' and 'happiness' only to replace them with 'housing space' and 'amenities', both of which lack the intuitive ui and depth of the old, and really there seems to be no way to dig deeper into or look comprehensively at either feature than just looking at an individual city screen. Also is it just me or is amenities broken? It went down to like -4 in one of my cities once when I wasn't paying attention, but the penalties were the same as at -1 amenities, and apparently had been for a few dozen turns. So you can completely disregard happiness as long as you're willing to sacrifice 5% of your yields. Enemy AI is bad, even by Civ standards. Last game's homicidal Ghandhi was endearing, but now all leaders are ridiculously aggressive. The only time in 5 playthroughs I have had an AI attempt diplomacy with me was one civ who was at war with the other 4 that I knew. After he sent me a gift and praised me, and we had traded some resources (on unfair terms but no one else was trading with me and I needed gold), he then declared a surprise war on me, and never invaded. Which I am guessing is what happened between him and all other civs too, because although they were all at war for centuries, no cities ever changed hands. AI nations are impossible to trade with on terms that are not extortionate, and even bending over backwards and accepting unfair trade deals, I still have never been able to go beyond trade deals with an AI nation, even when I try to play a relatively peaceful style and deal with other more pacifisty nations. Also the only diplomatic attitude ui is emojis next to the leader's portraits, with no real explanations as to why. Every game so far, just about every nation I have met has gone to the frowny emoji within a few turns of contact, no matter how I handle things. Even better, after AI declare and subsequently bungle or abandon their wars against you, surrender never really makes much sense either. Once Japan totally surprised me, and before I could bring the bulk of my army and navy back to my unfortified and undefended capital it was surrounded by ~5 strong japanese units with more coming ashore. But no, they just kind of sat there. One of them pillaged one improvement. The rest just kind of sat on improved tiles. ONE unit attacked my capital city ONE time, and did some damage. Though if they had all attacked relentlessly, it easily would have fallen with minimal losses for the invaders. I bought an archer unit and literally built walls for like 10 turns, and bombarded the still stationary army. Once all the units in range were dead (~5 killed, ~5 remaining), Japan surrendered and gave me tons of gold for 30 turns. None of their units really went anywhere after the war either, the ones that had landed and were sitting on the border of my capital city still sat there until I decided to destroy Japan a few dozen turns later. Since that first time, every single time I have been invaded has played out in roughly this way, if they even make it to my cities. Barbarian marauders wrecking tiles are more of a pain than a serious invasion by the world's strongest AI armies, which is strange because the barbarians are AI too, and quite decent. I watched another country invading me lose most of their army to barbarian quniteremes trying to cross the ocean without naval escort, with the survivors mopped up by barbarian units on shore and 1 spearman I had been exploring the area with (who witnessed the slaughter from shore). I am guessing with the number of AI counties that declare war on me, and then offer me very favorable surrender conditions a few dozen turns later, with literally no fighting between us, have also managed to lose their invasion forces this way (?). AI is a little better at defending in wars than it is in attacking, so to keep things interesting I usually end up invading people after their first or second failed wars against me. Also the game just feels a lot smaller, in terms of city building options (districts were a really cool concept, but the ballooning costs really killed it for me, I didn't even understand what was happening until someone here explained it). The maps and armies also feel a lot smaller than in previous games. Growth feels a lot slower and more grinding too. On a huge map with 3 civs, tons of room for explosive growth, after 300+ turns of growth in these optimum conditions on regular difficulty, I have not seen any civ rise beyond a technoligically stagnant backwater that only really excels at one thing. On my huge map like this, around the year 1600, one civ had very advanced culture plicies, but was wayyyy behind in all aspects of development, the other had no special characteristics, and was far behind me(and the times) in technology, size, etc. I don't mention the third one because I believe they were wiped out by barbarians? There was a message about their death very early on, and unless they spawned rightttt next to one of the other civs, on a huge continents map, no civ killed them off. And in a more densely populated world this is even worse. I was kind of worried about the series becoming too dumbed down in Civ V, even though I eventually came to love that game after a few playthroughs. And if I can do the same with this one after a few patches and playthroughs I will amend this review. But right now, it seems the game has been dumbed down too far for my liking, and has lost that magic 'one more turn' feeling, which I can honestly say I never felt after the first few dozen turns in any of my playthroughs so far. Instead of becoming more fast paced as technology and society advance like in past games, if anything this game bogs itself down in ballooning unit and district costs in the late game, and there is no real feeling of sense or a narrative behind the actions of late game civs, or other civs at any point in history, really. I have yet to see a coalition of religions or ideologies work together or fight one another, which both civ 5 and 4 pulled off VERY well. Here, the mid to late game seems much like the early game, constant minor wars that go nowhere, and slow grinding expansion. Also sometimes someone will win a cultural or religious victory, and it can be you if you actually reach for either with any amount of effort. 3/5 of my complete playthrough have just ended with score victories, twice for me, and once for greece, who got a ton of points for advanced policies, but really wasn't relevant or powerful in any other way. None of these victories felt like winning though. I got a lot more familiar with how to manage districts, and am now playing for a science victory, but I am not sure if I am even going to finish this game. So far I just took over 2 nice big continents, and am now spamming campus districts and their buildings, while trying to hold off the religious emissaries from all civilizations who have not declared war on me. Thankfully for science, none of my enemies have been able to overcome my masterful defense strategy of: Building walls in a few cities. I don't garrison ANY cities, and right now have 2 spearmen and a warrior. The year is ~1700. When there is a threat of invasion I buy a ranged unit in the city. I should really just declare war on them so they stop sending the missionaries into my lands. Also wtf, religion mechanics never well explained, and basically no useful ui on them. To see the breakdown of city religion I need to select a missionary, but sometimes this does not even work. Also instead of the pressures from civ 5, the most indicator you will ever get of how things are going is an arrow. up or down. That tells you which religion is winning. I haven't even tried espionage because honestly I haven't needed it at all, but I doubt it adds much to the game."

Wait until it's on sale in a year or two."
223,46.2,Not Recommended," August 23, 2017",5,"Wish i could give neutralThe new district system feels awesome. You build city districts, such as a campus, which enable specialised buildings in them, like library and university. Both districts and world wonders take up a map tile. The city radius of 3 tiles in any direction helps a lot with this.There are various adjacency bonuses, and sometimes terrain requirements, and a lot of different districts.Honestly this system feels like a lot of fun. every single building is visually represented, theres joy in watching your little cities grow and spread across the map.HOWEVER.Districts can't be torn down or replaced. As soon as you merely START building a district, it becomes an irrevocable feature of the landscape. If you misclicked, you'll be sorry. And when you capture an AI city with districts poorly laid outThe number of districts a city can have is limited by population. In theory this just means that ou need to grow a little more to unlock another slot. However this brings me to the second issue:There's a midgame lull, where you'll exhaust all the resources around you and your cities get stuck unable to grow, amenity buildings can only be constructed in the entertainment district. If you don't have one then you're ♥♥♥♥ed, since you can't remove an existing district to place one, and you can't keep growing without one, you can end up stuck in a corner.All of this aside, there's also a disappointingly small number of buildings you can place in each district. Generally four in total by the end of the game. And with one small exception (museum types), theres no choice in that, its just brainlessly build all four and the district is maxed out.The new tech system is interesting, the tech tree is split into scientific and cultural things, the latter using culture instead of research to unlock stuff. It does mean less focus is on science, which has previously been something you must excel at or die.The vast majority of the things in the culture tree are government policies. They come as cards you can slot into your chosen government type. each of the 10ish government choices has its own arrangement of slots.HOWEVERMany of the policy cards you unlock are frankly, awful. It feels like they weren't properly playtested, or given much attention to balance. And as a result i find myself gravitating to the same 30%ish of the cards and ignoring most of them, as the bonuses they give are too small and too situational.Given the extremely tiny number of slots a government has, versus the vast swathe of policy cards you'll unlock, you'll find yourself just not using most of them.The combat system is awful. Because its the same system from Civ V. It was awful then too. Its slightly less awful now, thanks to the addition of corps and armies - you can fuse several of the same units together into one stronger version. This new idea works but is unlocked too late to really fix things.The AI is...complicated.In terms of running an empire at least, the AI appears to be competent, a bit too much so, or perhaps they're just cheating. AI players seem to take a tech lead in the beginning, and even on a low difficulty - with me and a friend working together, we had to struggle to even keep to the middle of the pack, as AIs outstripped us in tech and military power, conquered their neighbors, and hoarded every world wonder and great person before we could get a look in.On a macro level, the AI seems very efficient at building running an empireOn a diplomatic level though, there's a lot to be desired.AI players will frequently denounce you. Its impossible to avoid upsetting someone. Maintaining even one AI friend is extremely difficult.AIs will frequently and puzzlingly offer you trades that THEY don't agree to. They'll literally put an offer on the table and say something like ""there's no way i'd agree to those terms."" when they brought up the subject, and explicitly contacted you to present this offer.When you're winning a war, an AI opponent will contact you to beg for peace every turn. Every single turn. There's no way to just tell them to bugger off.And AIs will frequently contact you in order to request trading some large number of great works for more of the same, constantly trading works around in an endless circlejerk of diplomacy.And for all of the above examples, if you want to view these deals that pop up in your feed, clicking the icon will freeze the game for a few seconds while it loads up the fancy animated leaderhead, just so they can waste your time with this inane spam. This happens every turn in the lategame. Often multiple times per turn from various leaders, all of the AI leaders seem to exist only to spam your inbox with meaningless drivel and absurd trade deals.Dealing with them starts to feel more like work than gaming. Thankfully you can ignore them, but you cant dismiss them. The offers will sit there conspicuously in your notification area, until you talk to the AI, which you'll need to eventually.Overpowered early barbarians, forces warrior spamCity states still insist on spamming the world with every boring detail of changes in their diplomatic relations, and they become yet another source of background noise that drags you down, wastes your attention reading it, and ever so slowly saps the fun out of the gameThe trade system is also a pain. the constantly asking you to pick a new destination for the traderoute stops being a meaningful choice. Eventually you'll just be clicking to repeat the same route, because you already have another route to all the other places. Menu is laggy as hell, because it insists on finding and displaying a fancy path for every destination you hover over, however incidentally. Pathfinding over half the size of the map is not cheap, even if you have a monstrous CPUAny AI that manages to found a religion will make its solemn duty to convert you, and everyone else, by building thousands of missionaries and sending them into your territory.These missionaries ignore closed borders, you can't keep them out. They just walk right in. And due to the stupid one unit per tile system, they block the movement of YOUR units, unless you're willing to declare war. You can kill them with troops, but declaring war makes you the bad guy and causes a relations penalty with the world.You can ask an AI to stop trying to convert your people, but they'll either refuse, or agree to stop but then keep doing it anyways.War is not fun. The AI never learns its lesson. After you're done taking a city or two, you'd think they'd show you some respect. They will beg for peace and offer you handsome rewards, but as soon as you agree to it, they'll go right back to denouncing you, trading with your enemies, conspiring against you, spying on you, closing their borders and spamming missionaries all over your lands.The only recourse you have is to completely annihilate them and take every city. You cant make vassalsThere's no building queues in cities, and no automation for workers. So every time a city or worker is done doing the one thing you told them, you have to give them the next order. And then the next, and the next. This quickly becomes a pain with a large number of cities, and leads to you probably not bothering to improve large empires. The fact that workers have limited constructions before they need to be replaced doesn't help thatSid Meier himself once said, ""A game is a series of meaningful choices."" and thats something i'd strongly agree withUltimately, Civ VI is a game of many, many choices. But a very large portion of them are not meaningful. The game far too often asks - nay forces you, to make decisions that are irrelevant, and to manually take actions which are tedious and should have been automated or skipped entirelyToo much of the gameplay just feels like workOverall, 5.5/10"

Not exactly rushed out but definitely missing a whole lot of polishing.The UI is a mess often lacking plenty of information you really need. For instance an entire enemy force which sets foot on your territory; there is no alert for that so you have to check everything yourself. They tried to simplify the design of the interface but instead it merely leads to more looking and clicking till you may or may not find what you have been looking for.Also the AI is completely nonfunctioning, making decision without any sense (e.g. sending units into combat that will definitely not survive or sending them into combat to simply pull them back immediately). The AI is often not capable of negotiating fair trades. Most annoying, however, is the warmongering of the AI. At times declaring war when you just met them and have not even build a second city, but at least declaring war after a while for no apparent reason. The latter happened in ever single of my games. A few times I even have been at war with someone who I have not even met.On top of this several quite annoying bugs (e.g. units with no orders and unused move points are simply forgotten without notification until you remember yourself Oh, there was that archer I haven't moved for 20 turns.) Also the loading times are way too long. I stopped the time at 1 minute and 40 seconds, playing on an SSD.To be entriely honest, the new additions (e.g. districts, policies and such) are nice and cool but feel more like DLC. There is too little new content and too many steps backwards to justify the full price."

After he sent me a gift and praised me, and we had traded some resources (on unfair terms but no one else was trading with me and I needed gold), he then declared a surprise war on me, and never invaded. Which I am guessing is what happened between him and all other civs too, because although they were all at war for centuries, no cities ever changed hands. AI nations are impossible to trade with on terms that are not extortionate, and even bending over backwards and accepting unfair trade deals, I still have never been able to go beyond trade deals with an AI nation, even when I try to play a relatively peaceful style and deal with other more pacifisty nations. Also the only diplomatic attitude ui is emojis next to the leader's portraits, with no real explanations as to why. Every game so far, just about every nation I have met has gone to the frowny emoji within a few turns of contact, no matter how I handle things. Even better, after AI declare and subsequently bungle or abandon their wars against you, surrender never really makes much sense either. Once Japan totally surprised me, and before I could bring the bulk of my army and navy back to my unfortified and undefended capital it was surrounded by ~5 strong japanese units with more coming ashore. But no, they just kind of sat there. One of them pillaged one improvement. The rest just kind of sat on improved tiles. ONE unit attacked my capital city ONE time, and did some damage. Though if they had all attacked relentlessly, it easily would have fallen with minimal losses for the invaders. I bought an archer unit and literally built walls for like 10 turns, and bombarded the still stationary army. Once all the units in range were dead (~5 killed, ~5 remaining), Japan surrendered and gave me tons of gold for 30 turns. None of their units really went anywhere after the war either, the ones that had landed and were sitting on the border of my capital city still sat there until I decided to destroy Japan a few dozen turns later. Since that first time, every single time I have been invaded has played out in roughly this way, if they even make it to my cities. Barbarian marauders wrecking tiles are more of a pain than a serious invasion by the world's strongest AI armies, which is strange because the barbarians are AI too, and quite decent. I watched another country invading me lose most of their army to barbarian quniteremes trying to cross the ocean without naval escort, with the survivors mopped up by barbarian units on shore and 1 spearman I had been exploring the area with (who witnessed the slaughter from shore). I am guessing with the number of AI counties that declare war on me, and then offer me very favorable surrender conditions a few dozen turns later, with literally no fighting between us, have also managed to lose their invasion forces this way (?). AI is a little better at defending in wars than it is in attacking, so to keep things interesting I usually end up invading people after their first or second failed wars against me. Also the game just feels a lot smaller, in terms of city building options (districts were a really cool concept, but the ballooning costs really killed it for me, I didn't even understand what was happening until someone here explained it). The maps and armies also feel a lot smaller than in previous games. Growth feels a lot slower and more grinding too. On a huge map with 3 civs, tons of room for explosive growth, after 300+ turns of growth in these optimum conditions on regular difficulty, I have not seen any civ rise beyond a technoligically stagnant backwater that only really excels at one thing. On my huge map like this, around the year 1600, one civ had very advanced culture plicies, but was wayyyy behind in all aspects of development, the other had no special characteristics, and was far behind me(and the times) in technology, size, etc. I don't mention the third one because I believe they were wiped out by barbarians? There was a message about their death very early on, and unless they spawned rightttt next to one of the other civs, on a huge continents map, no civ killed them off. And in a more densely populated world this is even worse. I was kind of worried about the series becoming too dumbed down in Civ V, even though I eventually came to love that game after a few playthroughs. And if I can do the same with this one after a few patches and playthroughs I will amend this review. But right now, it seems the game has been dumbed down too far for my liking, and has lost that magic 'one more turn' feeling, which I can honestly say I never felt after the first few dozen turns in any of my playthroughs so far. Instead of becoming more fast paced as technology and society advance like in past games, if anything this game bogs itself down in ballooning unit and district costs in the late game, and there is no real feeling of sense or a narrative behind the actions of late game civs, or other civs at any point in history, really. I have yet to see a coalition of religions or ideologies work together or fight one another, which both civ 5 and 4 pulled off VERY well. Here, the mid to late game seems much like the early game, constant minor wars that go nowhere, and slow grinding expansion. Also sometimes someone will win a cultural or religious victory, and it can be you if you actually reach for either with any amount of effort. 3/5 of my complete playthrough have just ended with score victories, twice for me, and once for greece, who got a ton of points for advanced policies, but really wasn't relevant or powerful in any other way. None of these victories felt like winning though. I got a lot more familiar with how to manage districts, and am now playing for a science victory, but I am not sure if I am even going to finish this game. So far I just took over 2 nice big continents, and am now spamming campus districts and their buildings, while trying to hold off the religious emissaries from all civilizations who have not declared war on me. Thankfully for science, none of my enemies have been able to overcome my masterful defense strategy of: Building walls in a few cities. I don't garrison ANY cities, and right now have 2 spearmen and a warrior. The year is ~1700. When there is a threat of invasion I buy a ranged unit in the city. I should really just declare war on them so they stop sending the missionaries into my lands. Also wtf, religion mechanics never well explained, and basically no useful ui on them. To see the breakdown of city religion I need to select a missionary, but sometimes this does not even work. Also instead of the pressures from civ 5, the most indicator you will ever get of how things are going is an arrow. up or down. That tells you which religion is winning. I haven't even tried espionage because honestly I haven't needed it at all, but I doubt it adds much to the game."
194,75.4,Not Recommended," December 4, 2016",5,"Coming from Civ 5 and previous civs the base game here is feature complete compared to the last games. However, there are a lot of negatives here that make this game not worth the AAA price they are asking.The AI. It is atrocious, and is probably the worst AI I have played against on any strategy game(and I play a lot of them if you check my library). The AI does not know how to do diplomacy correctly, offering crazy things that make no sense. The AI does not know how to use tactics in war at all. They will send units towards your city and it may look overwhelming, but then half of them just spread out and go seperate ways for no reason allowing you to just pick them off. They try to attack your boats with their unit transport ships(this made me laugh). They will settle literally one tile away from the border of your city, and cram cities where they should not be(basically any space, even with no food).The UI. The UI has a lot of little quirks and bugs that make it annoying to use. The main complaint I have(I can't believe it's not fixed after the first patch) is the alert system. I can go a few turns before I even notice an AI player is wanting to trade or demanding something. It just pops up a little bubble on the right-side of the screen. Also these little alert notices are bugged and you cannot remove some of them or click on them to expand them sometimes.Bugs. There are to many to go over here, as I notice them nearly every play session.Graphics. The mobile cartoon look is horrible, even though I don't really care about graphics much it is worth mentioning as they are worse than Civ 5.Overall this game has potential to surpase Civ 5 in a few expansions maybe, but it will depend on how they patch the game. I don't see them making AI much better honestly(it wasn't that great in Civ 5 either). I will come back and update this review if I notice they patch out these issues, but as of this review the game is not worth $60. I would say it maybe worth grabbing it on a sale of 50% or more off."

This actually feels like a complete game in it's vanilla state, Religion, Trade Routes ect. are all here in the Vanilla version. Hell it even fixes a lot of the complaints I had with Civ V complete. I honestly can't think of what they really need to add in expansions as of right now, other than new civs of course (Byzantium, Mayans, and Persia pls)Now about that dumbass AI (the War Elephant in the room). It still can't use 1UPT for♥♥♥♥♥♥and is basically just as bad as V's other than one new issue: the warmongering. Where the AI in V was content to just passive agressively denounce you every few turns the AI in 6 will declare war on you constanly and hate you for not following their agendas or for no reason at all. The agenda system is good on paper but in practice it means someone is always salty af. These people have no chill. I hope Firaxis fixes this at some point. Like why is Civ IV's AI from 12 years ago still infinitly better than V and VI's?Also just kind of weird but in my first complete game of this (which I played on Prince) I was in the Modern Era in 1250 AD and spent pretty much the entire game atleast 10 techs ahead of every AI, so I spent the last half of the game mowing down Saka Horse Archers and Pikemen with my machine guns, while waiting for enough tourists for a culture win. It was a very odd experience.I feel like where Civ V was an awful game made great with expansions, this will be a good (but flawed) game made great with expansions, it will probably end up being better than V a few years from now when the expansions are released. Civ IV is still easily the best Civ game though, and I don't see that changing any time soon."

74,85.4,Not Recommended, March 20,5,"In Civ 5, you might feel like a King or Queen of history shaping an interesting world into your own vision. In Civ 6, you feel like a toddler fighting with other toddlers over the toys on the cartoon map that uncle Napoleon gave you to play with while he does the real work. I don’t think you should pay more than a few bob for a colour-in sheet and some crayons to be honest.Conducting diplomacy with Elmer Barbarossa or Phillip Bunny just feels too stupid on several levels. Whether it be the way they swagger as they spew outlandish nonsense, or their total inability to incorporate realpolitik into their decisions, dealing with these children playing dress-up is only ever annoying.The world and tile system is interesting and more rewarding, but unit diversity (especially with UUs) feels non-existent and culture and tech have become tediously similar. I approve of culture buffs relative to science, but having 2 long continuous trees instead of 1 on seperate screens makes planning harder than necessary. Policies are a pretty awesome idea, though it feels like they need a greater variety of buffs to play with.Dear God, please banish all of the missionaries (which I can’t even kill) to hell. Religion has gone from nearly worthless, to an irritating rush win strategy which blocks up the map with tiny sanctimonious blaggards.I could go on, but what we’re looking at here is a shoddy game, with a few great core ideas that are unfortunately buried in the manure of the rest of the game. I started finding this game annoying after my first game, 5 or 6 later and I’m still not enjoying learning it (which should be the best part). 1 game of Civ 5 later and I’m much happier."

116,20.5,Not Recommended," May 8, 2017",2,"I love the Civ games and have even put a decent amount of time into this one as well. At first I wanted to recommend this game to everyone as the music and graphics are fantastic and really appealing. However that's about as good as it gets for the Civ game. (Compared to previous entries)First off, diplomacy doesn't exsist. You meet a civilization and your choice is to say hi or not to. (has little to no impact) Next after twidling your thumbs messing with improving your civ you get denounced. Why you may ask. Well because you're inferior of course. You don't have the tech that they are given at the very beginning so **** you. After you try to improve relations and improve your Civ they declare war on you. Why again? Oh because you're weak and dont believe in their religion. Afterwards they send their ""army"" which usually consist of 2 units that you obliterate. Then once you conquer them the whole world denounces you for being a ""warmonger"" which basically just makes you nerfed to all hell because you ****ing fought back. Like seriously did they even evolve this game?Pros:Nice GraphicsNice MusicCons:Horrible AIHorrible DiplomacyHorrible city planning (districts are cool but usually make your small piece of landmass a huge city with no space for further development)Horrible building (Sometimes I'd build a district or something and all that happens is a big red exclamation mark pops up saying something is in the way but when you bring a builder to clear the area nothing happens)Game gets boring quick (Like I said no Diplomacy so no temporary friendships or trade)Oh and trade lol, You try to make a resonable offer to a country and they will 99% of the time decline the offer, then 5 rounds later will ask you to trade all of your resources AND gold per turn for their 1 cottonI wanted to love this game so much but it just fails in every strategic endeavor. I even waited MONTHS before I reviewed this game hoping the devs would fix these issues. However, after all these months with nothing but♥♥♥♥♥♥updates and ridiculous DLC that adds things that should already be there. This game does little to nothing new that the old Civ games did better.

In any case, right now V (with all DLC, speicifically Brave New World) is much cheaper, always on sale, and a more complete game. I think V is still the quintessential civ game right now, and if you're reading reviews seriously you probably are new-ish to civ. Wouldn't recommend to people relatively new to the franchise simply because V is better (especially singleplayer) and more balanced right now. Still can be a blast, and I'm glad I purchased it since i have several hundred hours across the civ franchise."
153,207.7,Not Recommended, February 9,2,"TLDR: Too many issues, awful AI, awful map generation.Ever since the expansion came out, I haven't managed to make it more than 50 turns without being declared war upon by the AI who somehow has far more units than I could have hoped to produce in that time frame. I had hoped that the AI would get better and more reasonable with the expansion, but they seem to have gotten worse. I can't build a builder without having four AI's denounce me and declare war five turns later. I truly enjoy the Civilization franchise, but I'm having no fun with this current iteration. To add on to the AI frustration, it doesn't help when you start a standard size map with fewer number of civs than the game calls for, and somehow two opponent civilizatons are within 15 tiles of your start location. There is nothing fun about that, you know an AI civ will declare war just for being too close."
914,3.8,Not Recommended, February 5,2,"Whilst remaining a great strategy title, the game that single handedly advanced the resource management and 4x genres to heights never before imagined, now seems to me to be something that has been subsumed and surpassed by the Total War series. And for that reason, rather than for any individual lack, I can't bring myself to thumbs up it to a modern audience. Continually pouring out sequels that offer only minor advancements ( a la Football Manager) is not going to save the license but instead quantify the maxim ""flogging a dead horse"". On top of this you have the globally disliked use of DLC milking. All of which can only result in the response ""for diehard fans of the series only""."
36,243.8,Not Recommended," January 27, 2017",2,"Plainly stated this is a terrible base game. When compared to vanilla Civilization V, this game is unplayable. Civilization IV, which I wasn’t fond of, and Civilization V by far are more coherent and fun to invest my time playing. Civilization VI on the other hand, suffers massively due to the A.I, terrible/useless Civ bonuses, lack of a decent user interface and overall terrible design. The game does benefit from certain aspects, consisting primarily of the superb soundtrack, leader animation, leader personalities, and voice acting; however, the good doesn’t out way the bad, far from it actually. Even though the leaders are nicely animated and voiced, in my opinion, the selections for many are questionable, especially for the Civs they’re representing. I don’t understand, and maybe this is because I love history, why Firaxis couldn’t get certain historical aspects correct. I understand it’s just a history game but Europa Universals, the Total War series, and Hearts of Iron, all try their best to accurately name countries and leaders. Civ V had this issue but it’s profound in Civ VI. The creators should have stuck with Civ V and adapted fan made mods into the base game. The A.I at least made some sense in Civ V as well, but in Civ VI, I had a game where I met a civilization and next turn they declared war on me without a reason. This gets frustrating constantly when compared with how the human player must declare war. I don’t understand why they didn’t mix Civ IV and Civ V’s diplomacy together for Civ VI, an example from Civ V is when the A.I is able to ask about troops on their boarder, but why couldn’t the human player get that in Civ VI? Mods adopted that ability in Civ V and it worked perfectly, so why leave it out again for the human player? The art, besides the leaders, is so lazy in this game compared to its predecessor as well. The religion icon selection is terrible and uninspired, just like Civ V. Honestly, it’s best to wait until this game is granted steam workshop support or until game changing DLC is announced.Lastly, I preordered the game and received the soundtracks as a bonus. The Civilization VI soundtrack, like I mentioned was terrific, but the 25th-anniversary soundtrack was a joke. It seemed like it was just thrown together last second and added in to convince people that they hadn’t forgotten about the 25th anniversary. A digital art book would have been nice and a more thought out anniversary soundtrack would have been appreciated."
13,96.3,Not Recommended, February 14,2,"A little background on me. I only played Civ V before this one and much like everyone else, I think that is a great game that works well.I got this game as a gift and can tell you right off the bat, the art style wasn't my thing. I've gotten over it though, and its tolerable for me. This game, could've been good, but the devs have failed (and still are) with balancing the AI.There is no balance, at all: On easier difficulties, enemy civs will almost never declare war on you. Once you get to King difficulty, its almost like it is inevitable that they will. I've never seen just one do it, each game there has been at least two of them declaring at the same time. The problem here is that on the harder difficulties civs will be extremely far ahead of you in tech no matter what, leaving you at a tech disadvantage and a numbers disadvantage.AI progession is broken: Even on easier difficulties, with sparse resources, there will always be one or two civs that are strong everywhere regardless. You could go all out on one victory situation and think ""yeah, easy win"", then you see a civ that already has rocket-based military, then see a notification that they have started launching space projects. Might as well quit the game. This is multiplied on difficulties past king. I've once seen a civ at this point at turn 150, which is insane.DENOUNCE, DENOUNCE, DENOUNCE, oh and DENOUNCE: This is a HUGE problem. If you so much as try and fight for land, which you some times have no choice as you may need resources, the rest of the AI players will CONSTANTLY denounce you the ENTIRE game until the end. Not only is seeing a leader denounce you get repetitive and boring, the game is penalizing you for strategic play. The cost for declaring war is WAY TOO HIGH. If the rest of the civs hate you for the one war you fought in, you cannot make border deals or research agreements for the rest of the game. Two key elements in some strategies. What makes this more frustrating is, EVEN IF A CIV DECLARES WAR ON YOU, they will hate you. You don't even have to be the one to initiate it. If a civ declares war, and you see it out until the end removing that civ, they can and will denounce you for simply defending your territory. COMPLETELY STUPID MECHANIC.AI trading: Civs in this game will try and rob you blind. They will constantly bait you for ridiculous trades. This annoys the crap out of me. I'm willing to trade stuff, but for a reasonable price. I've once seen a civ attempt to get iron from me (1 every 30 turns)........................FOR 6 GOLD. Like, are you serious?The game still has its moments, but I see broken and flat out stupid stuff like this all the time. It ruins the game. As far as I know, the most recent DLC hasn't addressed any of these issues either.I simply cannot recommend this game. A gift? Yeah, go for it. For its price tag, the ridiculous pricing of its DLC, this game's ridiculously dumb/broken AI isn't worth a dime.

The game is fun and the graphics are beautiful, but there is one serious issue that prevents me from buying or recommending it.As you play the game with other AI players, they will sometimes bring units onto tiles in your city and just leave them there. When another player's unit is occupying a tile, you can't do certain things with it (like improve it). There doesn't seem to be any way to get other players' units to leave a tile besides declaring war and destroying them, which seems unreasonable for most cases. You can't ask another leader to have their units leave your borders. You can't ask the unit to move or nudge it out of the way.I did some searching and found that this issue has been reported repeatedly starting right after the release of Civilization VI in late 2016.

Between all the various civ, tech, policy, adjacency and other bonuses I often find myself feeling like it was less of a hassle to just build what my advisor suggested than bother with all the math – rendering all the depth of the new version rather hollow. I don’t doubt that with several playthroughs you could really figure out how to maximize a civilization’s potential, but that feels more tedious than epic. All of this is thrown into even starker contrast with the AI, which doesn’t seem to be any more dynamic than previous versions.There’s some creative stuff in the game (districts are interesting, wonders on the map, separate science and culture trees).

In all seriousness, I've felt that I have gotten my money's worth after 25 hours, this game has so many fun layers to it. The soundtrack is amazing as well, adding on a new instrument with each advancement into a new era (I've only heard England's so far, and can't wait to experience the other Civilizations' themes)."

If I wanted a simplified console version, I already have that. I was expecting much, much, much more from the PC version.GOOD:-The voice acting and dialogue is very good.-Graphics and smoothness is vastly improved - amazing.-Civics policies are introduced as a separate track from Technology, uses culture instead of science. Cool system.-Making terrain improvements consumes a builder slowly but surely. And as you advance in tech, your builders can do more things before being consumed. Very cool new twist.-Wonders are more complex, which requires more planning that previous Civ versions.

It's bad.-The AI is pretty terrible, as other reviewers have reported.-AI starts with some pretty insane cheats, even at ""average user"" level.-Civs are not balanced against each other.-Overall, the game is very unbalanced.-Diplomacy is dicey at best and no-fun pretty much all the time.

The new combat system as idea is great (no more 100 units in 1 slot) howeverAI is not able to make any good logic how to use army. A small outdated unit in passage can stop whole army because if not killed right away other units cannot attack. Computer sometimes will move untis in random direction without clear target.Removing transport units for sea and allowing ay unit to swim is another bad move.The whole game lost balance because of that.

72,186.5,Not Recommended," June 27, 2017",2,"This is a great game. On launch, I feel like Civ VI is much more complete than Civ V was. There is religious victories and the leaders have many interesting new abilities not seen in Civ V. The developers changed the movement mechanics in a way I feel makes much more sense than in Civ V. The districts are a wonderful addition to the game, making city placement even more important than in Civ V. This mechanic promotes more awareness for future city development and victory conditions.The only thing I was disappointed with at launch was the AI relationship with the player. The diplomacy is not as fleshed out as it should be. However, the cultural, religous, and military interactions with the AI is not really inhibited by this, so I was not very put out. When the DLC began to be released however, I was angry. In what world is $5 for a civilization fair? There are no real gameplay additions with these DLC packs. If the customers of Civ V were charge $5 for every civilization the developers added to the game, no one would have bought Civ VI.Maybe they are not planning on Civ VII because at $5 per DLC civ, I will not be buying."
444,18.4,Not Recommended, January 2,2,"I really wanted to like Civilization VI after enjoying Civilization V (after it got its prerequisite expansions to improve upon what was a pretty mediocre vanilla game), but I just couldn't get into this new version. The art style is a big turn off, and it looks a bit too much like a cheap mobile game in that respect. It has made reading the terrain extremely hard in many cases. I find it almost impossible to pick out the goodie huts on the map, for example.I found the game at launch to have some significant balancing issues, which may have been bad luck on my part, but it is what it is. I had several games where the barbarians completely overran my position and made it impossible to survive. I had a game breaking bug that corrupted a save file in another game (which sounded like it was a common problem with Kongo?). The diplomacy is uninteresting, and unless things have changed the AI was more or less incapable of taking a city with walls.There are simply too many design problems that existed in the vanilla Civ VI for me to recommend it based on my playing experience. I've been watching the last year for more positive reviews and feedback to emerge saying that Firaxis had fixed everything in patches or after the first expansion, but the reception has still been largely lukewarm. I'd recommend that anyone interested in this game hold off for at least another expansion to see if Firaxis manages to right the ship or if it ends up sinking to the bottom of the sea -- and hopefully takes the dreadful Sean Bean tech quotes with it."

And other aspects, like religion and the dual tech trees and society cards, are intriguing as well and fun to play around with.Alas, the AI remains dumb as doornails. No amount of good design can make up for an utterly incompotent AI design - especially when other games manage a decent if unexceptional plausibility in AI opponents. Diplomacy also lags far behind contemporary design - the diplomatic model in games like EU4 is just far more interesting, plausible and enjoyable. In Civ VI it's a pointless exercise in frustration and irrelevance.Finally, the pacing seems off - technology seems to advance way too fast for production. It often seems that you've barely produced a unit before you're off into the next age, without having had any time to do anything noteworthy in the age you were just in. The tech progress can be slowed down - but unfortunately that slows down production as well. So the relativities remain basically the same, but the game is slowed to a glacial pace.There's a lot to love in the game design, the innovations like museums and tourists and a very interesting take on great works and great leaders. Many of the flaws above can probably be fixed in some fine tuning in patches - but I suspect the completely incompetent AI will not be fixed. It's a pity, perhaps the Civ community can come up with a bit of magic modding to create an opponent worth playing - but for now I reluctantly have to give this a thumbs down.After all the criticism of bad AI in Civ V, one would have hoped Firaxis could have made more of an effort.

The AI player can finally use both air and naval power, the diplomacy system is no longer a total mess, and religion is improved. If you've been on the fence about Civilization VI, now is the time to take the plunge.[Update: Australia Patch]Unfortunately Civ VI still suffers from some very annoying issues - with AI players hitting the Atomic Age about a 1,000 years early, nonsensical AI war declarations, etc. However, it is much improved since the original release and is worth a look when on-sale. One caveat is that somehow Firaxis botched the localization with their latest update and now parts of the game are in Portuguese instead of English...[Original Review:]Civilization VI has a lot of cool new design elements and is quite different from previous Civ games (for better or worse). However, what effectively ruins the game at this point are bugs, poor balance, and a terrible AI that overshadow everything else. For example, even on higher difficulty levels, the AI won't upgrade their troops. In my current game, it's the Information Age and I'm literally fighting off hoards of Slingers! The AI also has no sense of relative power, as they will declare war on you with no chance of victory; plus will ask for the sun and moon for any trade that's even remotely balanced. On the flip side, sometimes AI players will hit the Modern Age by 1000AD! These aren't game breaking on their own, just some examples; but it's the overall majority of issues that conspire to ruin the game.Wait for a patch or two before purchasing would be my advice. I'll revisit this review as the game hopefully shapes up."

Commercial Hub, Neighbourhood, Aqueduct..)- Amenities and housing brings new hardness to the game.- I love the True Earth Location map.- You can spend 12 hours a day with this game easily.- Tech tree (applies to other Civs as well).- Australia DLC pure love.Cons:- Barbarians.

It's NOT! I've finished one game of Civ VI so far and won on score alone because I did not plan my cities in a way so that I could get a science win.

At full price Civ 6 is no where near worth it and I can get bored of games quickly. You can still have fun, don't get me wrong (seeing as how I still managed to get 128 hrs). However, Firaxis is as greedy and inept as big studios come, charging a fraudulent $30 for DLC that does not contain anywhere near $30 of content. If you must buy this at full price really take a long think about it first. I would suggest getting the full Civ 5 bundle (all the DLC) when it's on sale for a few bucks, it's totally worth it.Summary: I do NOT recommend this game at full price. If the price comes down, yeah you can probably get plenty of hours out of it. Choice between 5 and 6? Get 5 bundle on sale.Good:-New concepts (districts)-Policy card system is not a new idea but the implementation of the separate culture tree is interesting-SMOOTH gameplay that is less buggy than Civ 5-Multiplayer works MUCH better than in 5-Graphics - if you like ths style.Bad:-Feels like a lot of content is missing (hello world congress?)-AI is still utter garbage (lazy devs not wanting to fix it)-Gameplay sometimes feels restrictive, feels like I have less options than in Civ 5 where there were more unusual but possible strategies-No proper modding tools for more specialized mods like Civ 5's IGE-Base UI is bad-Firaxis is slow and unresponsive to issues (as a full release title do not expect frequent patches or bug fixes)"

Many people say that it is buggy or that the district system is unballanced. I however think the opposite.Districs: People say that a lot of the districs are wasit of a tile, this is true to some extent. You have to specialize your cities. One city can not get the job done. You have to build the districs that get adjacency bonusses, if you do not do this than some of the districs seem to be a waist. In this game they encourage empire building. Like in real life a large empire is stronger than a small one. You need many cities so you can specialise your cities with districs. This is very differnt from the other civ games. Civ 5 actully discourage empires by giving unhappyness for your number of cities but in civ 6 the more cities the better in most circumstances (In civ 6 your cities also havethere own independent hppiness).Once you learn the distric system you will find your self loving it. It can actully be kind of overpowered if you do it right. Districs are the main reason why people struggle in this game so people tend to think its flawed when in reality it is only becasue they do not fully understand the mechanic.Buggy: I have 240 hours in this game and have yet to see 1 individule bugg. If any one says the game is buggy i do not mean to come off as rude but they could not be any more wrong.What you should take away from this is that this game has very differnet game mechanics than any other civ game making it hard to start but once you learn the new mechanics it is an amazing game."

64,197.1,Not Recommended," February 10, 2017",2,"Coming from civ 2, civ 3, civ4 and civ 5, i find Civ 6 misses the mark. the weakest point of the game is promotions, only limited to 7 and then thats it. Modded Civ 5 had approximately 20 promotions for units and I would have expect Civ 6 to take that onboard and develop the promotions further, but they are severly lacking. Scouts are useless by about turn 100 as they have no upgrades and become cannon fodder for all and every unit. Civ 5 again allowed you to upgrade the scout to archers etc once they have no use as a scout.The graphics are cartoony, yes, but I actually like that.Religion has been hammered to be almost useless now, Civ 5 was far superior.Spys in Civ 5 were important and played a big part in stretgy, in Civ 6 again they are pointless and if you ignored them entirely your game is unaffected.Governments are also lacking, and have small impact on gamepplay, unlike civ 5 where they were important and dramtically affected gameplay/style.I like the boosting to research for doing other actions , this is a clever idea and well implemented.I normally play Japanese and for some reason I am yet to work out, I have actually yet to build a samurai believe it or not. the progression of technology seems to bypass them, even though they are the quintessential Japanese unit, go figure.The concept of districts is a copy of the concept from ""another game"" and though its a good idea, works well, it does force you to building on larger land masses and makes building gateway cities on narrow strips of land completely useless other than creating a passage for ships but the city will be so restricted so as to be nothing more than a gateway between oceans. Progression in the game in terms of technology takes substantially longer than in Civ 5. I always get to nukes in civ 5 but i have yet to get beyond 1900 technology in any game i have payed so far which again is odd considering I have played for 50+ hours already. Even the AI is just getting battleships, no ww2 tech.I hope they produce mods and DLC which improve the game but given to basic concepts seem flawed I am unsure if this game will ever match up to previous incarnations of Civ, which is a huges shame.I can't recommend it in its present form. You might like it so maybe give it a go just dont pay top dollar and perhaps wait for the mod scene to kick into gear more.Update - Now to add injury to the wound that is Civ 6, it now keeps developing the endless turn bug, whereby you start a game and it just sits there processing other AI players turn and you never actually get to play. This game is truly FUBAR."
297,13.6,Recommended, January 22,2,"This is an incredible strategy game. But it lacks in living up to the incredible standards set by Civ V and Civ IV.Lots of people seem to complain about the AI being horrible, but the AI is basically the same as in every other civ game, but they just have these things called Agendas now. Agendas are policies that each specific civ leader will follow. An example is Trajan, Trajan likes civs that have a larger amount of land than he does, but he dislikes ones that are smaller. Every leader has their own specific one, and you need to learn to play around them. Lots of leaders will have agendas that contradict with other leaders agendas. So unlike in Civ 5 you can't just be friendly with everyone. You have to pick out a set few civs you wish to be your allies, and stick with them and follow their agendas. This can be seen as a good or a bad thing depending on your playstyle.Another large difference in this game than in Civ 5 is the unit movement. The new way the movement system works is that you have a set amount of movement points for each unit. In civ 5 if you used 1 movement point to go onto a flat tile, you could still use the leftover movement point to move onto any other adjacent tile. But if your first move was into any other rough terrain than you would be out of movement points. In Civ 6, you can't use the 1 extra movement point in the same way as in civ 5. Flat terrain takes 1 point, and rough takes 2. If you use one movement point to move onto a flat tile near a hill, you cannot move onto the hill tile adjacent because you only have 1 movement point left. Most people don't like this new system as it makes unit movement horribly slow. And the roads were changed so they don't help as much either. This basically constricts you to using cavalry units so you can actually move around the landscape in a reasonable amount of time.One other huge difference is cities. There are 2 ways to build your empire, tall and wide. Tall is when you have only 3-5 cities with a very high population, while wide is to have tons of cities with little population. Civ 5 heavily favored tall empires, while civ 6 heavily favors wide. This is mainly due to the science and culture change. There are no more ""policies"" but instead there are 2 tech trees. One running off culture and the other running off science. In Civ 5 you didnt want a lot of cities because it slowed your science and culture production due to cost of policies and techs increasing the more cities you have, it was also beneficial to have a lot of population in your cities because of how the science buildings worked (Library, National College, etc.). In Civ 6, there is no penalty. You have to make as many cities as possible, and just put down tons of campuses and theater districts to generate science and culture. This will be a huge change to those going from Civ 5 to Civ 6. I personally like building wide empires more as it gives more land control and actually feels like you are trying to control and expand your empire.TL;DR: This game is incredibly different in playstyle from Civ 5 and will take getting used too, but is fun nonetheless.If the movement system is changed and if they add some more non DLC civs, then this game might rival civ 5. But as of now Civ 5 is clearly superior."

38,47.2,Not Recommended, January 20,2,"Civilization VI is off to a solid start, however as is expected there is much to improve and a few things that simply feel wrong. While some may not like comparisons to CIV V given it's had allot of time to be refined, that game is also not perfect and could be improved. However I'm surprised some of the things it did right, did not come over to civ VI.At first the art style was ""in your face"" different, in a bad way but over time it's kind of grown on me. However some may struggle with the yield icons as they're small and hard to make out for me. A harsher dark outline would make seeing them far easier for both me and others who have trouble seeing them.The different lenses are absolutely fantastic. Being able to see the appeal of my tiles, my religious spread and where it's coming from/going to as well as the settler lense are all welcome additions. However for AI games I feel a ""wanted territory"" lense is despeartely needed so players can avoid expanding on a different continent, in the opposite direction only for the civ they promised not to expand towards get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off and declare war in the near future. This would also reveal AI flaws (EG if every single hex was off limits)The districts system is new and interesting. I've enjoyed trying to figure out which districts should take priority and it adds some satisfaction to city management. I feel there's too stark a difference between the good and not so good districts. A faith district is there purely for making a religion and I feel is shoved to the side when the 2 trading districts or the science/culture/hammer districts come into play. Still allot to figure out, just hoping there can be multiple viable pathways as currently there is a cookie cut way to do things as there was in civ V.From the civics, the ease with which military tech units are obtained, the need for walls to be able to shoot barbs, the sheer strength of barbs and the fact that there're more military civs than passive ones screams of the devs trying to force conflict to occur.While there're only 2 more military civs than passive ones it may not seem so bad, but when taking into account how bleh so many of the passive civ abilites feel in stark contrast to civilization V's civs, it's pretty god dam awful for those who preffered a pacifist approach.The civic system is an addition I didn't enjoy as much as I thought I would. It looked like a flexible, more customisable option but is hindered by its tech tree structure and narrow range of card abilities.In civ V, you start your tradition/liberty tree with a little boost, then gain something more upon it's completion rocketing you civ forward. Complete the piety, patronage, aesthetics or rationalism had the same effect depending on what you were up to. Add in it's contribution to encouraging war with an abundance of combat based cards.I feel no such impact or satisfaction here, and far less flexibility in getting to what I want (which there is an extreme lack of) given it now functions as a tech tree. This may be a ""love it or hate it"" thing, and unfortunately I'm in the hate it boat. The civ V policy trees were simply better.The science tree feels narrower and is unecesarily stretched out with overly large lines. It looks bad and feels bad to navigate, as you can't see what leads to where.While the micro management of civs it fun and all, the housing/amenities system absolutely crushes any hope of building a tall civilization. While I don't mind wonders taking up hexes, as they look sweet, like a trophy on my land, this addition only emphasises how poor a choice building tall is in civ VI, further cutting down on the avaliable options and making your civilization more optimiased to mass producing units for war.Religion also took a hit in civ VI. Many of the pantheon beliefs seem, to be quite frank,♥♥♥♥♥♥ Very few are linked to a luxury resource as in civ V and many revolve around certain terrain, most of which can be removed by an enemy or providing boosts to your military.An extremely prominent annoyance are the constant requests from AI's. Every time they send you a delegation, which is very gawd dam common you get a pretty, little cinematic. Add in multiple AI and you'll be spending more time spamming the ESC key than playing the game. I simply don't care about maming AI happy anymore, because it's so tedious and infuriating to do. Am quite shocked there's no option to disable the cinematic menus.Movement in civ VI is an extreme downfall compared to its predecessor. Instead of spending w/e movement u have left to move onto a hill, you simply won't move onto a woods/forest/hill. I found it extremely irritating being constantly told to move my units when they can't complete a turn without moving in the opposite direction due terrain being in the way and this really slows down the pace of the game, makes retrieving workers/settlers from barbs nigh impossible without going to their camp and simply feels awful in practice.Civilization VI will undoubtedly be improved in the future in many ways, but unless the issues I have with it are not only fixed but improved drastically, it will be very very difficult to justify the pay wall these fixes will be locked behind. And given their emphasis in forcing you to go to war, and my hate for the tediousness by which combat functions I'm likely to stick to civiliation V with my pacifistic science/cultural victories.. I reccomend similar players do the same as there's simply more fun to be had with civilization V for now."

I lost with in the first 20 minutes due to a player winning a religious victory. I did not discover a religion so ther was nothing I could really do about it because he was on the other side of the map.The civopidea is kinnda a joke....

103,39.5,Not Recommended," October 23, 2016",2,"I will start off by saying I have not played Civ V or Beyond Earth. The last one I played was IV, so It's been a while.Overall the game is quite entertaining.I have had a lot of fun playing a online game with a friend. However, a few things as of right now prevent me from recommending this game.--Cons-AI actions are a bit strange. Rome for centuries just stacked warriors as I played as his German friend across the water. He had no stats that showed that he disliked me, constantly complemented me, and we even announced our friendship. However, when I sent a settler a good distance from his one city( Mind you he had only Rome after centuries) he sent his legions of warriors and chariots(I had knights and eventually musketeers ) over to surround his ""friend""s new found border. Then declared war right when the frienship expired. I just don't get the behavior. (Played difficulty: Warlord)-Game Killing bugs: Several times have run ito issues of game progress stopping. Says a unit needs order, but everyone has moved and will not progress. Played Multi with my friend and after our turn, the AI would not finish their turn. I recommend saving a lot, atleast every 20 turns if you do play.--Personal Con/RantI am not a fan of their leader picking, it is extremely odd and forced. Gorgo being the main example, barely mentioned anywherein history besides being Leonidas's wife. Greatest achievement was scraping some wax off of a tablet that had an encoded message. She did not rule anything, her husband however did.(Even after his death, her son was king and Cleombrotus the tutor) So if you want to play the we need more women game, pick one that makes sense and actually did something. Historically most nations were ruled by men; Sorry. Same goes for Catherine of France, was excluded from ruling by the Kind, sons took over afterwars. Joan of Arc would have been a better choice.--End RantPros---The art style in my opinon is awesome. Great work. Creates a fun feel to the game.--The tutorial is a great refresher, I recommend it.--Game mechanics work well and make for some good strategies and competition.-- Sean Bean :)End Note: I will gladly change my review, when the bugs have been worked out and the AI acts a bit more reasonable.Though if you don't mind the cons I listed and can hold out, then I say go for it."
72,186.5,Not Recommended," June 27, 2017",2,"This is a great game. On launch, I feel like Civ VI is much more complete than Civ V was. There is religious victories and the leaders have many interesting new abilities not seen in Civ V. The developers changed the movement mechanics in a way I feel makes much more sense than in Civ V. The districts are a wonderful addition to the game, making city placement even more important than in Civ V. This mechanic promotes more awareness for future city development and victory conditions.The only thing I was disappointed with at launch was the AI relationship with the player. The diplomacy is not as fleshed out as it should be. However, the cultural, religous, and military interactions with the AI is not really inhibited by this, so I was not very put out. When the DLC began to be released however, I was angry. In what world is $5 for a civilization fair? There are no real gameplay additions with these DLC packs. If the customers of Civ V were charge $5 for every civilization the developers added to the game, no one would have bought Civ VI.Maybe they are not planning on Civ VII because at $5 per DLC civ, I will not be buying."

Often other countries are upset with you for things you cannot know and will hate you forever if you declare war. In most games, all AI have denounced all other AI and the player. Thus what is the point of even caring about global relations? I would like ot add I have played all other civ games from CIV III on up and this one does not add up. I would advise waiting to buy until the developers crawl out of the hole they work in, sober up, and read the community feedback.

Mods do not disable achievements, which is one of the few gripes I had about Civ5.Diplomacy is terrible in this game. If you don't care about diplomacy and you're like me, knowing you're going to wipe out every faction including city states anyway, then that might now bother you. But I got to say it is annoying it takes so little to get denounced in the game, and happens often. I've tried actively building relations with another faction in this game, and it isn't easy and when I have managed to do it, it doesn't last long before you're going back down hill. Then there's the cartoony artstyle. Which feels like a step backwards when you compare it to Civ5. That being said, I've played some games with more cartoony visuals that I liked a great deal. So that in and of itself isn't totally a bad thing. But it does turn some people off. I was more open to it given previous games I've played that had similar approaches to that aspect, but coming directly from Civ5 to Civ6 was an adjustment.I'm recommending it because despite the things that bother me about the game, I can still have a good time with it. Some things can be offset by the talented people making mods for the game. A game shouldn't have to depend on it's modding community to make up for its faults, however. But at least it's there."

A few bugs and technical things that mistify me, like a lack of space to view your relationship stateus with another civilization and confusing move system where you end up wasting a lot of move points. Overall this game has the potential to be great, but is missing too many pieces at this point.

Overall, this is a worthy entry to the series and I feel it is well worth the asking price."
45,126.4,Recommended, February 1,2,"The more I play Civ VI, the more I am liking it.If you're looking for an upgraded, new, polished version of Civ V, then this is not what you're getting and you're going to be disappointed if that's what you're looking for.On the other hand, if you're willing to give it a shot, the new mechanics and the new ways to do certain things become more and more fun. So to sum things up, here's a pros and cons list after a few games:Pros:- Graphically beautiful game- New ways to manage the tiles in your city, takes some getting used to (+ City Management)- New battle animations- The tiles on which wonders can be built are restricted depending on the wonder- Tons of new resourcesCons:- Weak A.I., especially in the lower difficulties- Some playthroughs can be ruined due to intensive barbarian spawning early on- Not Civ V (if that's what you're looking for)- Feels relatively easier than past Civs, noob friendlyOverall,I find Civ VI is a nice, refreshing addition to the series that suceeded with many of the new implementations. You just have to go at it with an open mind and give things a try. New mechanics like traders building your roads are pretty good too. One thing however, is that enemy A.I. will engage in such silly battles. Like you'll have a unit with full health and a general on top of it, and the ai will still attack you with a lower tier unit that has like 10 health, killing themselves in the process. Other than a few small things here and there, the pros shine bright enough to make for a very good Civ, with lots of potential to improve it even more.8.5/10"
466,74.0,Not Recommended, March 11,2,"This game has a lot of potential and has a lot more going for it than vanilla CIV. It has the potential to be something amazing down the road. However it has a long way to go.Certain issues that bother me are you dont really get as many trade routes as you used to back when the game came out. With that being your main method of building roads its pretty necessary.Another issue is, in Civ 5, If someone messed with me I could go and wipe out a few of their cities, once they knew they were going to lose, they'd offer you some of their weaker ctiies. I'd burn them down and if I liked the location I'd build a new city on top or near by the burnt down city. In CiV 6 if you get a city through a trade. You're stuck with it. The only way to burn it down is to give it back and then declare war. It's ridiculous.Huge maps feel small. In Civ 5 I could do a huge map and have A LOT of space between my nearest Civ neighbor. In this game Your nearest neighbor spawns super close and once they know where you are THEY ♥♥♥♥ING BUILD CLOSER AND CLOSER. It's infuriating. My last game played I had 4 cities. I like to keep them spaced out so the borders will expand and fill the gaps. China decided 8 cities wasn't enough and went through the one tile gap between my borders into an empty cluster that was to be filled by my border growth. He settles a ♥♥♥♥ing city right inbetween them. Meanwhile Ghandi starts sending settlers up to my region too.Thats a few of the gameplay issues I have with it so Im going to talk about some other issues with DLCFiraxis used to be known for awesome sales , however Civ 6 has over priced micro DLC. Civ and Scenario packs that run 5 each. These never go sale either. 5 is too much for a civ and a scenario I will never play."

I have a tight budget, but figured the return would be worth it if I played anywhere near as long as I played 5.The game randomly crashes, but not from the get go. That would be too simple. No, the crashes are truly random. 20 minutes in. Frustrating, but I can restart. 6 Hours in. Now my day is ruined. Can crash for no apparent reason at any random♥♥♥♥♥time.So I did homework, and more homework, and there is apparently no fix. A lot of people have the same problem, but no real solution has been found. Hardware be damned, this disease apparently knows no bounds. So I gave up for a few months, forgot the game existed.And then one day theres a patch. It's a big one, takes hours to download. I figure this might be it! They heard the clamoring of many angry fans and fixed the crashes! So I download it and start a game. I play all evening, no problem. Save and hop on the next day. It's a perfect weekend, my expensive new game is fixed and I have no other esponisibilites. I sink almost 10 hours into this save, and then it happens:The same. ♥♥♥♥ing. crash.Needless to say I'm absolutely crushed, I wasted a massive amount of free time that I really don't have much of these days, and I basically threw away $60, which stings. I'm done with the game, I'll probably never invest my time in it again. And I recommend that you don't either, unless you make sure that the random crashes are fixed. And I'm serious, make sure.

50,141.9,Not Recommended," January 16, 2017",2,"I have put many many hours into the Civ franchise, over 100 on Civ VI alone, and while the game isn't terrible I cannot recommend it.There's a lot of small changes to get used to, not a big issue, however a lot of important functionality has been lost in the process. One of the biggest peeves I have is the chaining of road building to merchants. No reason to send a merchant to any one of your many cities? Well most likely there will never be a road leading to that city. It's a terrible way to manage roads and serves no purpose except to make the incredibly stupid idea of disposable builders hurt a little bit less.Two, disposable builders: this is the worst change in the game. You get a few ""charges"" to construct improvements and then they're gone. Whomever thought this was a good idea needs to skip the planning meetings going forward. It's an awful idea that leaves a player spending loads of turns wasting away making builders. There's no longer any strategy to protecting them, simply churn out a new unit and build your improvements. There's no improvement upgrades as far as I have noticed, so once their wad is blown that's that. It's insipid at best. Also no roads get built by builders, as mentioned previously, it's impossible to connect your cities if you don't waste 20 turns of your trader's time. Considering 20 turns can be in-game equivalent to 200 years you can see how mental of a system this is (seriously 20 turns to establish a road to a city 6 hexes away in the early game is just stupid).Three, it's boring. The game very quickly becomes dull and lifeless with no real point. You pretty much have to play aggressively which means you pretty much only ever get conquest wins unless you purposefully retard your army and hold back. Not fun. There's no real sense of accomplishment, just this repetitive cycle of tech, war, and building that doesn't really matter. Just build a big army of archers in the first 50 turns and kill everyone, game over. Dull.I wanted to like this game, maybe they're saving a nice update that will make the game fun for a future $60 expansion pack, either way I'm done with it. This is a sad and unenjoyable chapter in the civ franchise, lacking basic common sense functions like road building and generally taking way too long to get anywhere in the game if you want to play other than Ghengis Khan style. Mid-game is a dull slog up the tech tree to the atomic era where you're still bored, but now have nukes. I appreciate all of the work that went into the game, but can't recommend this game at all. I have no idea why the Civ team seems to think they need to reinvent the wheel with every iteration of the game but this reinvented wheel is mostly square and doesn't roll along very well."

Civ V has a merable soundtrack, I love just playing it, a very memerable soundtrack.Civ VI on the other hand has only a few actual tracks, if there are more I haven't noticed, they all sound the same. Other than that, the graphics have a very Sims 4 feel, (and no, that is not a good thing), as in it feels more like a cartoon.This game does do some good, I liked the government feature and the policy system were both very good in my opinion, but that's about all the praise I can give this game.

In it's current state, it is not good, although the DLC may change that. My issue is, they branched from what they new. Civilization branched from its original old time graphics and map display, and original mechanics, to make a more glorified and glossy version. I, a player who has played much of Civilization V and Civilization IV didn't like all the new mechanics and graphics. Especially when it came to workers, how could you limit the charges on workers????? I haven't played much of this game for a good reason, I think my 2.9 hours spent was more to listen to its impressive soundtrack. Im not going to lie, the music is amazing, the best Civilization soundtrack so far. In the end, a soundtrack isn't worth 60-80$, not even 35.99$. So, all in all, I believe that this game cannot really do justice to the Civilization franchise, I heard reviews all saying how good the game was, but it was a major let down. Once it was released, all the media attention stopped. If you were to buy a Civilization game, make it Civilization V, this game just dropped the ball. I hope the DLC will make it worth my money, because DLC is a big part of Civilization V, but I just don't see myself wanting to play this game."

The game feels like a step back from civ 5. The map is filled with too much information that is useless. It comes to the point that my eyes almost hurt trying to process all the information. And the information that i want is non existing. Example of things that annoys me and or make the game nedlessy complicated:- Overall to many menues that have no real purpose- City UI is terrible, managing citizens is a nightmare with bigger citys- Don't know if religous pressure is a thing anymore but i can't find the numbers- WAR... lots and lots of WAR where nothing happens- Warmongerer penalty is a ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥. Some dumb civ declares war on you and capturing a city or two from them gets you so much warmongerer penalty that the rest of the AI civs denounce you and later declare war on you.- I miss the restart button. If you find your placement bad or don't like it you have to go back to main menu and restart. It gets old really quick.- Can't change the number of citystates and the placement is aweful. They are always in the way but the exellent bonuses you get makes you not want to kill them all.I hope to change my review to positive but wait a couple of months untill patches/mods/expansins fix the endless small annoying problems before buying2016-12-31 updateOK so i have learned to love or at least tolerate most of the things that irritate me with this game.

I have created vast empires across the years, but now with Civ6, I have been able to strategize to my victory in greater depth than previously imaginable. Now with unstacked cities, and a much more intensive focus on the map, each city can be more specialized. Civ6 feels more natural in gameplay compared to its predecessors. For example, the new road mechanics are more historically-realistic; roads are made acoording to where trade happens. Though the game may have released with quite a few bugs, the fact that the developers actively update the game shows the amount of effort put in by Firaxis."

At first I wanted to recommend this game to everyone as the music and graphics are fantastic and really appealing. However that's about as good as it gets for the Civ game. (Compared to previous entries)First off, diplomacy doesn't exsist. You meet a civilization and your choice is to say hi or not to. (has little to no impact) Next after twidling your thumbs messing with improving your civ you get denounced. Why you may ask. Well because you're inferior of course. You don't have the tech that they are given at the very beginning so **** you. After you try to improve relations and improve your Civ they declare war on you. Why again? Oh because you're weak and dont believe in their religion. Afterwards they send their ""army"" which usually consist of 2 units that you obliterate. Then once you conquer them the whole world denounces you for being a ""warmonger"" which basically just makes you nerfed to all hell because you ****ing fought back. Like seriously did they even evolve this game?Pros:Nice GraphicsNice MusicCons:Horrible AIHorrible DiplomacyHorrible city planning (districts are cool but usually make your small piece of landmass a huge city with no space for further development)Horrible building (Sometimes I'd build a district or something and all that happens is a big red exclamation mark pops up saying something is in the way but when you bring a builder to clear the area nothing happens)Game gets boring quick (Like I said no Diplomacy so no temporary friendships or trade)Oh and trade lol, You try to make a resonable offer to a country and they will 99% of the time decline the offer, then 5 rounds later will ask you to trade all of your resources AND gold per turn for their 1 cottonI wanted to love this game so much but it just fails in every strategic endeavor. I even waited MONTHS before I reviewed this game hoping the devs would fix these issues.

The number of times I had to restart a game because I would be surrounded in other civilizations, within 7 hexes of my capital, giving me no room to expand, it also helpfully means they hate me because we have 'border tension'.Warmonger penalties, as per the usual mean that most of the time you end up having all your long time allies suddenly decide you need to die, because you are winning a war.On the plus side, districts are pretty cool, once you get used to the idea of sacrificing improvements in order to build them.The tech tree however is terrible. It has such easy 'bee lining', that is often the AI, as well as the player will just avoid techs because they have terrible bonuses. I often only research them because I can, and because I like to have all my techs move forward together, not because they were good techs to research.Finally, the multiplayer is unplayable. Desyncing every 2-10 turns means you spend more time loading the game than you do playing it, and the devs have no ways of solving that, if you don't believe me, check the forums, they offer no solutions.So ultimately if you want to play a good Civ, play the last one."

Like every iteration of the series since Civ IV I expect that this game to improve with the addition of new addons (which, of course, means paying more too).However, the diplomacy in this game is utterly broken: Not only is it enormously difficult to please the other civilizations in the first place and make them friends (there seems to be more negative modifiers then positive ones) but that whole effort is absolutely wasted when they consistantly break friendship agreements to randomly declare surprise war on you along with another civilization that they had a poor view of just a few turns before. This breaks any sense of building up lasting allies or diplomacy spiraling out of control into bad relations. It's simply random, immersion breaking and not fun.I've been playing the Civilization series since the original title. I put countless hours into Civ II and Civ IV. While I think Civ V needed some work from it's state at launch I stuck with it throughout and still had lots of fun even before the add ons; I can say the same about Beyond Earth infact! However, I'm shelfing Civ VI (and reinstalling Civ V) until there is another major update to address my main issue with the game among others.

No penalties.Developing science and civics is incredible easy with the boost system. Also no penalties for number of cities.All in all you can have 100 cities and there is no penalties or difficulty of running such a huge empire.Information menus are gone or poorly made. List of military units? The list of your cities can't be sorted by production, science, or whatever. So when you hit 20+ cities get ready to micromanage for 10 minutes every turn. Also no more auto-production.Overall information on anything is bad or non existant.Districts are a gimmick. They dont make the game harder or immersive. They just make you trade off a resource tile to put buildings on. Improving and exploiting resources is still important. Builders (workers) that disapear after they have done their number of upgrades is dumb.Everything is streamlined, science, civics, city states, so there are no major trade-offs to consider anymore. Everything has their separate resource and function to make it easy (and boring). Government cards is the worse idea ever.

Between this and the scouts, the early game is much slower than civ 4 and 5.All that being said, as far as I can tell the developers appear to be listening to a few of the complaints (they eventually put the ability to name your cities back in, which wasn't in from the start for some reason), so it'll likely eventually be worth buying.

That being said, I still enjoyed it enough to play hundreds of hours. I can't say the same for VI.Civilization VI moves the happiness system back into the background so it's no longer an issue, but the diplomacy is worse than V was. No matter how you treat your allies, the moment the alliance ends they will join the denouncing circle of poo that always seems to form. Every turn you will be denounced by the people you just fought off for being a warmonger--until they declare war on you, only to loose--and then everyone else declares war as well.In short, while I enjoy aspects of this game, I won't even bother to play it again except as a guilty pleasure for the short fun periods of initially arranging your empire before you have to deal with the endless slog of stupid AIs and the ten hours it takes to actually finish things. /End Rant."

Yes, Civ 6 does indeed prove that even more new ideas and good changes were and are feasible.When you think about the fact that Civ 5 was quite bad at release and only got really good with the addition of the DLCs you'll be amazed to think about what will be possible now with Civ 6, because it's already better than Civ 5.Now let me get back, I have to play one more turn..."
179,188.2,Recommended," January 29, 2017",2,"I'm one of those people that was playing Civ 5 up until this one's release. And I never tried Beyond Earth but I know that it was a disappointment to a lot of people so hopes were high for this one.In a lot of ways, this feels like Civ 5 + the expansions, but the thing is, Civ 5 + expansions is one of the most balanced, and interesting strategy games ever made, so that's not exactly a bad starting point.Normally Civ games are pretty weak upon release and then get better as they go on with DLC, expansions, and patches. This game feels incedibly complete and balanced as it is now.Although so far the DLC offerings for this game seem pretty weak, this game is also expected to receive mod support and free updates as it goes on.The biggest difference between this and Civ 5 though, is that cities now require multiple tiles for various things you can build, which I think is a brillaint addition to the game for a few reasons. 1. Cities now feel more real as you have to specialize cities at first to focus on different bonuses, and they feel more unique as they take on different shapes and looks. Also, since wonders now take up space, you can't get a huge advantage in this game by just rushing as many wonders as you can.Another big difference is the possibility for a religious victory, which is also done very well in my opinion. There can only be a limited number of religions on the map, and whoever gets one first gets a decent advantage as you win a religious victory by converting the majority of every civilization to your religion.There's a few other differences in this game between it and Civ 5 but overall, if you've been waiting for a new Civ game, this really scratches that itch."
274,181.6,Not Recommended," October 23, 2016",2,"Right now, I cannot recommend this game.I had to stop playing because the late game turns into a slog of issuing and reissuing orders to trader and spy units. Turn times are still long... even with the game installed on an SSD.The UI is designed poorly. Bright/cartoony map colors and art styles blend in with every bit of information or indication that you need to play the game. It's hard to see what you need to see.Units auto-cycle at a slow pace after getting orders, leading to many misclicks. You may even plan to move two units. They're right next to each other. Seems intuitive you'd move one right after the other. Nope. Move one. Expect to move the other (there's a delay... everything in Civ 6 comes with a delay). Next thing you know, the game lumbers across to the other side of the world so you can switch to planning a trade route in the middle of a battle.You do a lot of trade route planning. Sid Meier's Trader Planning Simulator 2016 would be a more appropriate title. Right now I got 10 trade routes that I have to reassign to the same cities... at a pace of about once per ten turns. So every ten turns, I have to issue one hundred trade route orders. That's a lot of orders. Each one takes a bit of time as the game processes your clicks, a second or two at a time. That is, if you don't misclick during these delays.Many of the game features seem simplified compared to past titles. Potentially deep and meaningful things like espionage and religion are very shallow and don't seem compelling or useful. Civilization is a game about numbers and data. These two modes could be shut off entirely with little impact on the game itself. Missionary combat is another layer of warfare. However, it's just two melee units vying for what amounts to a miniscule bonus. But hey, they seem to put a lot of work into the animations... which I turned off because turns take forever if everyone has to show me their little song and dance.The game doesn't suffer from any performance issues as far as I can tell. It just is designed to move at a slower pace. A one second delay here, a one second delay there... it adds up.Sluggish, unresponsive, and at times, buggy UI frustrates. Tedious reassignment of trader and spy units bogs the late game almost as much as the turn times. You can move through 250 turns pretty easily. The next 50 will start to frustrate you more.The AI still doesn't know what it is doing. Only now you get the benefit of hunting for the data you want. Why is a leader suddenly unfriendly towards you? Search in the submenus. You'll find it. Well, you won't find what you want to know. You'll find some numbers without explanation. Some leader ""agendas"" that often contradict each other. China's leader was threatened by the number of world wonders I had, but yet also looked down on me because my culture was low.There are also some weird unit design quirks. Catapults and archers can shoot twice as far as machine guns and rangers. I tried to research the effective range of ancient weapons. The ballista seemed like it had the longest real world range at 800 meters. Guns can shoot further. It might fit in with some idea of balance in the game, but it doesn't make sense.Combat also seems to move at a slower pace due to a new design in movement points. You now need a full two points if you hope to move on to those hills. Don't expect a unit to move into a grassland and then into a forest unless you've got special upgrades. From a balance perspective, ranged units are now much more powerful due to the lack of mobility. Your melee unit can get stuck moving one square at a time as archers obliterate it. Or, you can roll across a continent picking off the enemy AI's suicide runs. They throw weak melee units at you all day with little tactical planning. Their archers are formidable. But they don't use any kind of coordination. With support units, combat is now more about the bonus from adjacent tiles. I think this just makes the AI ever weaker.If you do want to wage war, prepare for your entire game to be about warfare. The AI seems to remember everything bad thing you do and forget the good things. Lucrative trade deal for +10 relationship bonus? Gone in a few turns. Raze a city in 2600 BC? Well, everyone hates you in the modern era because of it... even the AI on other continents.30 hours in and I find myself rage quitting because of these nagging issues.Save your money. Wait for some DLC's."
143,228.0,Not Recommended," October 23, 2016",2,"I'm a huge fan of the Civ series so I'm really sorry to not be able to recommend this game.The AI is what makes Civ a great strategy game series; whether it's the backstabbing Montezuma, the calculating Queen Elizabeth or the reliable old friend Ghandhi -- they're your opponents. The very artificial intelligence in Civ 6 cannot win battles, accept (or offer) good deals for both parties, and is schizophrenically erratic where it comes to decisions of war and peace.On my very first and only game (on prince -- where the AI and I are on equal footing), I managed to have war declared on me twice and I built fewer than ten military units the whole game. The first time I easily conquered France (who declared war on me for some reason), while the second time Greece accused me of sending missionaries into their territory -- which I didn't even do. After conquering them both without losing a single unit, I decided to focus on technology. At the point I reached the atomic age, I realized that culture was like tech for civics. Ooops. And then I got a message that my largest rival Civ (who had a greater population) had just entered the Renaissance.The AI can't even beat me in my first game -- how is this a challenge? People gave Mafia 3 terrible reviews despite the solid graphics, great voice acting, and fun basic mechanics mostly becausse of a terminally moronic AI. That's very much the case here as the sound track, leader animinations, voiceovers, and possibly good mechanics (we'll never know without a worthy opponent). However, at least in Mafia 3 the AI had discovered gunpowder before I finished the game."

Why pay full price to line their pockets for a half baked game... It will also drop in price with time, so just as an added bonus! Now with that out of the way. About the game: I can sum it up in one word. Pointless. I have always enjoyed the Civ series, but this version really doesn't offer much value. I'm not a fan of the sprawl effect. I really didn't find the micromanagement that came with selection city tiles enjoyable. And I hated the fact that the tech tree only went so far. There was so much room for more that could have been designed into it. At least some near future tech would have been fun to build and play with. Civ 5 went farther and was by far the more interesting. But if your a fan, by all means try it. Just wait until a more stable release and the eventual price drop!"

135,88.7,Not Recommended," January 12, 2017",2,"My experience with Civ6 has compelled me to write my first ever steam review. I really would like to recommend this game, but in its current state the game has enough problems that you should wait some time for them to all get hammered out. Fortunately most of the issues seem very fixable. A bit of background, I've played every civ game since 2, logged almost 300 hours on Civ5 and have logged almost 75 hours on civ6, having beat my last playthrough on Emperor difficulty.The Good:I really like the new district system. It's added a level of complexity and 'urban planning' to the game that previous iterations lacked. It encourages you to develop many cities rather than stacking 10 wonders in your power capital like you would do in previous civs. The new cultural, policy, and government system is also a welcomed new addition. The added flexibility is nice versus in Civ5 where once you had made policy decisions you were stuck with them for the rest of the game.The eureka/inspiration system is also a cool way to add side quests to your decisions to help boost a certain policy or technology. Finally, having great people actually do different things is another interesting way to vary up gameplay, although it would be nice if some of the writing/artist/music great people could do something other than create great works.I don't think the new city-state 'envoy' system is an improvement. I do like the unique bonuses that each city state can give you, but I think civ5's system of actively courting (well, bribing) city-states to be your friend was a stronger system.I do like how happiness (now called amenities) is now per city, but it's so easy to maintain happiness level that building as many cities as possible is the best possible strategy. In civ5, there were repercussions to building/conquering too many cities, and I think civ6 went too far in the opposite direction.I don’t mind the new art style and there are some changes to the map and UI that are helpful, such as lenses that give more pertinent information about the map based on context (such as seeing religion levels when moving a religious unit), but for some odd reason a lot of useful features have been taken out of the UI. For example, in most information screens, you can’t sort information. Scrolling through a list of 20 cities to see which one is producing the most science becomes more difficult than it should.As has been said in many other reviews, the A.I. has problems. Contrary to what I've seen others say, I actually find the A.I. in the early game to be somewhat respectable. Despite the fact that they sometimes are hyper-aggressive, it is challenging to fight them, along with the ever roaming barbarians. However, part of this early challenge is due to how bad the A.I. cheats on harder difficulties. On my emperor playthrough, every other civilization I encountered had 2-3 cities with multiple workers and military units within the first 30 turns. I had barely built my first worker. When the A.I. declared war on me, units appeared to just spawn from nowhere. I don't mind a challenge, but spawning units for free in a game like this is very frustrating. Because of these bonuses, the AI will also completely dominate in culture/science. I think in the year 200 A.D., I saw Kongo change its government to a Democracy and enter the modern era. 200 A.D.!Yet despite all this cheating, the A.I. has major flaws in the mid to late game that makes them nearly harmless towards the end game. For one, once they've built around 5 cities, they stop. They will try to conquer each other (and you), but their tactical management of units isn't very good. But this biggest issue, is that for some reason, the A.I. will not upgrade their units. An A.I. in the atomic era will still have spearmen and slingers. One tank army can almost single handedly destroy an entire A.I.’s military. I'd almost wish they'd cheat and spawn throngs of tanks and infantry to just provide a challenge, but after the medieval era, they just stop caring about their military.And to pile on to the diplomacy-side of things, once you decide to conquer a city, you can forget about diplomacy for the rest of the game. Warmonger penalties, even for wars you didn't start, cannot be surmounted with any amount of diplomatic good will. For a frame of reference, an Alliance is worth +18 in relationship with the A.I. Conquering one city is -15. Conquer two cities, and you are at -30, and your ally will denounce you. Never mind you conquered the cities of a civilization your ally is also at war with. It's nonsensical.Beyond the A.I., there are a few other issues. The pace of the game doesn't feel right. I think it's because you can now 'research' two trees at once, so you get through the tech and policy trees faster. Eureka and inspiration bonuses also cause this. In Civ5, I would reach a certain era at least within a century of when that era actually happened in history (e.g., industrial era around 1800 A.D.). In civ6, I discovered flight in 1100 A.D. This is on standard speed. It feels like there are gaps in both trees that might get filled in with new techs in later expansions, so hopefully this issue improves over time.If you were new to the civilization franchise, there really would be no reason to play Civ6 over Civ5. Every civilization game has been fairly different than the previous. Whether you liked Civ5 over Civ4 or not, no one can deny that Civ5 was a completely different experience than Civ4. Civ6 feels like Civ5 with a few things refactored. And with the current A.I. and pacing issues, Civ6 isn't as enjoyable as Civ5.Nearly everything that bothers me about Civ6 seems easily fixable. I remember when Civ5 first came out, it had a lot of problems, but with two expansions and many patches, it is a really good game. Civ6 feels like it is a few balancing patches and one expansion away from being a good game. The glaring omission of a United Nations in Civ6 leads me to believe the nearly absent diplomacy of this game will be fixed in the future.So, should you buy this game now? No, don't waste your time. Buy Civ5 if you haven't already or if you already have Civ5 then start another Civ5 game. Or try another 4x game. But just like Civ5, give this game a year or two to hammer out it's issues and it will probably be great."
254,5.5,Not Recommended," November 6, 2016",2,"I would recommend not buying this game in its current form. There's simply too many bugs in the game at the moment concerning the Singleplayer AI, diplomacy and UI. Basically, the current AI is only programmed to win through domination. The other win conditions are rarely triggered unless its the human players. In addition, you have no way of tracking how close you are to the other win conditions.Diplomacy is broken at the moment, since the AI is programmed to do two actions. It will either denounce you or declare war on you. No matter how friendly you are with the AI.I regret buying the game and not waiting for it to be more polished.

4,291.4,Not Recommended," December 29, 2016",2,"I feel like a bought a beta release. Even with the latest Winter update, there are still quirks that I find unforgivable. It's as if the programmers do not actually play the game they've developed to see if they've missed anything. Like the Alert function - was its inital omission intentional, and enough people complained that they added it back in... or did they just forget? Water units still have no Alert function.From reading other reviews, it appears this is has been the norm for a while now. While unacceptable, enough people are out there that are always going to buy a new release, and we live in an age where companies' primary concern is money.The new features and changes to the game are interesting. I've played a few games and do find it somewhat enjoyable. However, the interface is awkward and a step backwards from Civ V, in my opinion. There are a few irritating quirks. For example, I frequently have to repeatedly mouse-over the side notifcations before they actually display the description, and then once it finally displays, I can't read it because it gets blocked by the tile description pop-up for the tile that happens to be under the notification icon. Seriously? No one on the development team noticed this?? Or am I just doing it wrong?Bottom line: do not buy this until the price goes down. Stick with Civ 5. I was really looking forward to Civ 6, and this was the first time I've bought a game soon after its initial release. Lesson learned."
139,40.7,Not Recommended," December 29, 2016",2,"I have been a huge fan of the Civilization games since I played the fourth title. I have spent many hours on Civ5 and I loved every minute. I never experienced problems and the gameplay was smooth. That can't be said about Civ6.Civ6 adds many new features. For example districts and unit stacking. But it suffers from a very poor AI. You will get denounced, declared war upon and get asked to trade all your resources for 3 GPT by every single country every 5 turns. Also, after advancing a few eras you will go insane from the road mechanics. Firaxis thought it'd be nice to buff the roads every few eras, so when you have walked the maximum distance, you will still have the 0.5 movement left which will result in you having to click fifty extra times every turn. The map is also very small. I have only played on the 'Continent' type map, but if you like playing against many opponents, expect at least two nations right next to you.It'd be a fun game if it actually worked properly. My computer is constantly experiencing shutdowns caused by this game. Even though my computer can run every single other game on the highest settings, it can't run this game on the lowest.As you proceed further into the game, it will gradually take more and more time between turns. Most people also knows this from Civ5. However, later in the game, if you take over an enemy's capital or cause a big event to unfold, the game will simply crash and let you experience it all over again.I really want to like this game, but Civ6 is currently so bugged it isn't enjoyable to play. I really hope they will fix these bugs in the future, because it really got some great potential. Out of five stars, I will give it two. It's close to unplayable (at least for me), but when it works I have had some fun moments."

47,17.4,Not Recommended," October 23, 2016",2,"Okay, I get that they were trying to add a lot of new mechanics, but I think maybe they went overboard. Having to designate a specific tile for wonders and for districts while adhering to the myriad rules about which wonder/district can go where gets ridiculously difficult, especially if you also want to be able to feed and house your citizens when only certain kinds of tiles can be farms, etc. And it's many times worse if you're unlucky enough to be on a small island. Once you're well into the game and your cities stop gaining new tiles at any reasonable rate and are large enough that you can no longer purchase new tiles yourself, you're pretty much stuck as you can't do anything to remove districts/wonders if you discover later that you have a more pressing need for something else. Once not even focusing your city on food is enough, you may get into a situation where your city is shrinking and you can't build anything and even if you can research something that will give you more access to food, it may only be able to be built in a district you don't have and have no place to put. I'm finding it very frustrating even on settler level.

3,498.6,Not Recommended," November 11, 2016",2,"(tl;dr It has launch day bugs and brand new bugs, updates are almost entirely focused on DLC without the effort put into patching that Civ V enjoyed. I gave it a year expecting bugfixes and while there has been some work put into fixing issues, a game that was a promising true sequel to Civ V is just not getting the support it requires to be a proper successor. Patches are not properly vetted and always introduce new issues. Do not buy Civ VI expecting proper post-launch support)AI spams users with war and/or peace offers every single turn (bug). Invisible rivers on Inland Sea map were never fixed. Barbarian scout notification warnings permanently appear on your own and random game units. Random unknown ""player defeated"" notifications spam you for the first third of a game, even when it's just a city-state being captured. The AI returning your own captured city when negotiating for peace results in your own city having a zero growth penalty, because for some reason it counts as a captured ""foreign"" city (bug). The game exe still randomly crashes for a large number of people when exiting. Default AI will give away all great works for a single luxury resource (Similar issue to the launch day balance issues, but this one is a straight up bug. All AI will trade away great works as if they have no value). These are all bugs that could've been fixed in one patch, however game updates have been minimal and will introduce new bugs as much as fix existing ones. Unlike with Civ V which enjoyed multi-page patch notes, in VI patches are focused on adding more DLC to buy.If at war the AI will move religious units into your military forces which auto-kills them for no reason. Even if you do not found ANY religion, third party AI will denounce and go to war with you because you were ""converting"" one of their cities. Logically this is impossible, but because killing the religious units incurs a penalty against that specific religion, all nearby uninvolved AI will pretend it was your nonexistent religion that was converting them.The AI is still relatively useless and poorly implemented. It will plant a city in the middle of four of your own despite a lack of resources, then take offense when you are forced to path units around it. You will receive a severe diplomatic penalty as a warmonger despite never starting a single war, which makes relations with other AI practically impossible if you are forced into playing defensive wars. AI will still not improve tiles with resources inside its borders, instead electing to trade more gold for them than it would to buy the workers outright to improve the tile next to its own capital.Despite the numerous upgrades in capabilities (such as unit stacking to build armies) Civ V's AI was more capable at warfare, both defense and on offense. Seige and artillery units will attempt to attack move even though its not allowed, so the AI just throws seige units at your combat troops. Even outside of war the AI will waste a hundred missionaries to convert a city that can only be converted by a prophet, which makes the AI useless at most religious victories.I could paste three more paragraphs of bugs from my previous review, but I am too lazy to verify which of those issues still exist. Maybe Civ VI will be in good shape in three years, or after the first two major expansion DLCs get released. Issues such as the great works trading make multiplayer pointless due to AI abuse, and the AI itself isn't programmed on how to defend itself even on Diety making single player equally frustrating. Give it a few more years or wait till it's 80% off, otherwise expect new bugs to be introduced with each quarterly patch."

It's a breath of fresh air after the mediocre disappointment of Civ: Beyond Earth, Civ6 is incredbily satisfying and has tons of charm. The soundtrack is an amazing orchestral score, and the way it changes between Eras help to keep it enjoyable to listen to for a game that might last 300 turns. The changes to Espionage and Religion are also really fun, they're much more interactive than what was offered in Gods & Kings and Brave New World for Civilization 5. One of my biggest complaints it the AI seems to get confused and doesn't know what to do with itself most of the time past the Medieval Era, granted I've only played on Prince and King so, the AI might get smarter at higher difficulties. Overall, I'd say it's definantly worth picking up if you enjoyed Civilization 5."

141,109.2,Not Recommended," October 22, 2016",2,"i think it goes without saying that this is a pretty good game, and they've introduced some cool new features to it. firaxis isn't known for taking comments on their games, though, so i'll just put all the flaws here, maybe someone will enjoy them.-no regenerate map button when starting a single-player game. you have to exit to main menu and wait for it to load again. this is a ♥♥♥♥ing HUGE deal, if that wasn't entirely clear. a smaller, but still relevant nuance of this is that there doesn't appear to be any starting bias (naval civilizations don't necessarily start on a coastal tile.) this was a feature (a setting, togglable on/off) in civ V. they appear to have just forgotten how. enjoy resetting.-the strategic view is far from strategic. it's actually harder to see relevant information (tile yields, improvements, units) than on the default view. the edges of tiles are not clean lines, they are strange, wildly jagged shapes.-while the 'music develops over time' aspect is pretty cool, it gets crazy repetitive in the early game.-few hotkeys and they are barely customizable. where is 'center on current unit'? why can't 'fortify' and 'sleep' be on the same button?-rather hard to figure out new concepts, for example what the heck does a delegation do? why does it cost money? is it like an embassy? can they see my capital? none of these questions are answered in-game.-barb spawn rate is obnoxiously high for Prince difficulty-no option to turn down the amount of time spent hovering on a tile before it shows you detailed information on it. you will always wait about 1.25 seconds to learn whether or not a tile has hills.-hills and flat land look ♥♥♥♥ing identical-this one is just a very basic oversight: autosaves are not ordered by date, they're ordered alphabetically. so autosave 09 is above your more recent autosave 13. how nice.-you have to go to the civilopedia to see what bonuses districts get from adjacent tiles. in general, these bonuses are pretty well-hidden and you'll probably need at least one full playthrough to understand it, meaning the information is simply presented in an unintuitive and poor way.-there are 3 menus on the 'government' foldout screen. ""My Government,"" ""Change Policies,"" and ""View Governments."" there is literally no purpose to ""my government,"" and it gives you no information that the 'change policies' screen doesn't already show. but the useless panel is the default.-The coding on 'Escorted units' could use work. My escorted Great Generals sometimes insist that they have to move first. Speaking of units trying to move when they shouldn't, after using up a unit's movement, sometimes another unit is selected, and before I can make a choice (within about a second or so), a third and different unit is selected. Really jarring for my sense of space and direction.-Pretty much nothing gives you info 'at-a-glance;' you have to dig through menus to find whether a city has enough housing or amenities or whatnot. Again, unintuitive design is inherently bad design.-Long freezes after changing a policy setup, and some animation skips in diplomacy menu (namely in dealing with Kongo.)-Automation is poorly done (automated exploration units don't just walk AROUND barbarians) and inconsistent (you can't automate builders or archaeologists or great people that do stuff to tiles.) Did someone lose their thumb drive with those lines of code on it?-I nuked someone in peacetime. No diplomatic repercussions. What?I look forward to the non-alpha builds of this game.

21,208.6,Not Recommended," October 26, 2017",2,"Running a 2.4 Ghz Win 10, 64 bit, 12 Gig Ram, dedicated video Nvidia Geforce w/ 4 Gig Video memory, a solid mid grade machine. I've never given a Sid Meier game a poor review, until today. It's a good thing I used a Steam Coupon or I'd really be annoyed. First the good: There are elements of the “District” system I really like but that system is over-relied upon making it difficult to exploit resources and districts. This makes the districts game killers on smaller maps, or if you find yourself situated on an archipelago. I like the new policy system where policies are researched and you can customize your form of government. The Envoy system for City States is pretty interesting. And the game seems pretty stable with a variety of mods. I've checked out vanilla as well as mixing it up and game runs pretty smooth. That's the positive. Basic game-play is less intuitive, as are the controls. The actual game mechanics are typical of over-engineering, in later iterations, of a franchise on decline. This game's basics have devolved rather than progressed. The pathing for units is ridiculous. I have two possible paths for a unit which knows my capital is blocked by a another fortified unit and instead of going around, it back-tracks once finding the road blocked, until the capitol and the unit blocking it are out of the line of sight. Then it does it all again bouncing back and forth. A navel unit inexplicable reverses course, on its own in the next turn, upon sighting a land based barbarian and runs the other way without instructions. Its 100a.d. And I have yet to see a single barbarian navel unit so my ships are getting no basic training. The turns take too long to process. The graphics are shoddy at best. The new fog of war is a distraction more than an improvement. I was enjoying the sound track, playing as Japan, until I met Australia. Now all I get is Waltzing Matilda followed by Didgeridoo over and over and over. I've tried lowering my casus belli with Australia hoping to get the music to switch back but nooooo, just Waltzing Matilda. Nothing against the song. If I were playing Australia it would be great. As is, its ruining any sense of immersion playing as Japan. The interface for controlling the details and micro management of cities is now decentralized with several different screens making informed adjustments more clunky than Civ V. The general graphics quality is better on the surface if you don't look to close. But, these improvements seem to me to be more tricks of glints and glossing and richness of color, while in actuality they appear lower res than the older game. This gives the units a poorly executed bland skinning. The actual city graphics seem to be an improvement and I enjoy the changes from day to night but the reliance on having to build districts before improving them really slows down production of other early game necessities. Even with the coupon, I wish I hadn't wasted the money. Also a waste of 7 hours playing as I doubt I'll return to the save game. RUN AWAY AND DONT SPEND THE MONEY UNLESS YOU HAVE IT TO BURN and keep you expectations low."

I've had some incredible wars I completely remember in the past games, but I barely ever fought in Civ VI. Where Civ V added to the military strategy with one unit per tile (compared to the infamous stack of doom of Civ IV) Civ VI just takes it away by removing the incentive for warmongering.This in only one example. You will probably find others when you play it... if you play it. If it's your first experience with Civilization, just pick another one...maybe..."
20,126.7,Not Recommended," June 3, 2017",2,"No matter how hard I tried, I still find myself missing civ 5. It was a much better game. I loved the world congress and the international politics of banning resources, voting on a world religion, the world fair.. etc. WHY DID THEY TAKE THAT OUT? If it's removal was done so that the developers can sell it back to us in an expansion i'd be pretty annoyed. They better not charge money for that.Still haven't completed a game. I kinda get bored in the mid game.Also, I don't feel as impressive and grand when I build my glorious civ because of the terrible choice of leaders. The developers chose quirky leaders instead of iconic ones to bring about more nuanced diplomacy. For example, I never pick Egypt because Cleopatra is so exoticized and sexualized and shallow. It's so disrespectful. Whatever happened to Hatshepsut?I liked the idea of districts. But to be honest, it hasn't revolutionized the game as the developers said it would. It has not made war more nuanced. War is still a grab for cities.I also understand that the developers wanted to make diplomacy more nuanced with agendas.. but it feels like a more cosmetic change than a revolutionizing change. AI interaction is still boring..I liked the addition of the religious victory. However, pursuing it is so boring and feels like you wasted all your years of building your civilization just to buy apostles and meticulously and boringly convert cities.As a takeaway, I'm mostly soooo disappointed from the removal of the world congress and UN. And also the politics of your government type. I really liked how civ v made civs following freedom unhappy if they were surrounded by autocratic civs. i miss how you could use the world congress to ban a civ's access to a luxury resource to make their population so unhappy they staged a revolution in favour of your choice of government. Where did that go??"
50,141.9,Not Recommended," January 16, 2017",2,"I have put many many hours into the Civ franchise, over 100 on Civ VI alone, and while the game isn't terrible I cannot recommend it.There's a lot of small changes to get used to, not a big issue, however a lot of important functionality has been lost in the process. One of the biggest peeves I have is the chaining of road building to merchants. No reason to send a merchant to any one of your many cities? Well most likely there will never be a road leading to that city. It's a terrible way to manage roads and serves no purpose except to make the incredibly stupid idea of disposable builders hurt a little bit less.Two, disposable builders: this is the worst change in the game. You get a few ""charges"" to construct improvements and then they're gone. Whomever thought this was a good idea needs to skip the planning meetings going forward. It's an awful idea that leaves a player spending loads of turns wasting away making builders. There's no longer any strategy to protecting them, simply churn out a new unit and build your improvements. There's no improvement upgrades as far as I have noticed, so once their wad is blown that's that. It's insipid at best. Also no roads get built by builders, as mentioned previously, it's impossible to connect your cities if you don't waste 20 turns of your trader's time. Considering 20 turns can be in-game equivalent to 200 years you can see how mental of a system this is (seriously 20 turns to establish a road to a city 6 hexes away in the early game is just stupid).Three, it's boring. The game very quickly becomes dull and lifeless with no real point. You pretty much have to play aggressively which means you pretty much only ever get conquest wins unless you purposefully retard your army and hold back. Not fun. There's no real sense of accomplishment, just this repetitive cycle of tech, war, and building that doesn't really matter. Just build a big army of archers in the first 50 turns and kill everyone, game over. Dull.I wanted to like this game, maybe they're saving a nice update that will make the game fun for a future $60 expansion pack, either way I'm done with it. This is a sad and unenjoyable chapter in the civ franchise, lacking basic common sense functions like road building and generally taking way too long to get anywhere in the game if you want to play other than Ghengis Khan style. Mid-game is a dull slog up the tech tree to the atomic era where you're still bored, but now have nukes. I appreciate all of the work that went into the game, but can't recommend this game at all. I have no idea why the Civ team seems to think they need to reinvent the wheel with every iteration of the game but this reinvented wheel is mostly square and doesn't roll along very well."

That is just plain unethical and emulative of the beast EA.Many things are changed from how they were in Civ V, often these changes appear to be made just so they can justifiably say this game is different which somehow is understood as better. It isn't better. The unpacking of cities is a fun idea but it is not executed superbly. It is just so so. Leaders are more cartoony (the whole game is) which seems to follow in CIv Rev's footsteps not Civ V's. Things take too long to build for some reason. You have to build the district and then the buildings. Wonders look cooler but are way too big on the map.Game had obvious bugs on launch. Yes, they were patched soon enough, but still.Biggest annoyance though was buying the digital deluxe edition and finding it only included some of firaxis's cheap DLC's like, oh, here, we added one measly new leader. Yaay!

Deciding where to build your districts and improving them adds a layer to the game that I thought was a nice touch from a city building perspective. Mods do not disable achievements, which is one of the few gripes I had about Civ5.Diplomacy is terrible in this game. If you don't care about diplomacy and you're like me, knowing you're going to wipe out every faction including city states anyway, then that might now bother you. But I got to say it is annoying it takes so little to get denounced in the game, and happens often. I've tried actively building relations with another faction in this game, and it isn't easy and when I have managed to do it, it doesn't last long before you're going back down hill. Then there's the cartoony artstyle. Which feels like a step backwards when you compare it to Civ5. That being said, I've played some games with more cartoony visuals that I liked a great deal. So that in and of itself isn't totally a bad thing. But it does turn some people off. I was more open to it given previous games I've played that had similar approaches to that aspect, but coming directly from Civ5 to Civ6 was an adjustment.I'm recommending it because despite the things that bother me about the game, I can still have a good time with it. Some things can be offset by the talented people making mods for the game. A game shouldn't have to depend on it's modding community to make up for its faults, however. But at least it's there."

There is ofcourse a lot of ""Un-Learning"" and also with the new districts the game will seem to take one out of their comfort zone and familiarity of the mechanics we have grown used to playing prior versions of the game. Its this very uncomfort that can either be viewed as positive or a negative by players and probably the reason some have stated that its a step down from Civ. 5. Toi me these un familiar aspects makes the game challenging and also rewarding. I like the sort of integration of civics and science and also how one needs to grow the cities to grow the empire, which means this game involves planning never seen before in civilization series.I must admit I cannot understand why we are not allowed to rename cities (or maybe I have not figured it out as yet) and I also am grapling with finding out some reports I would like to see such as list of all units in ones army, or maybe they dont exist, maybe its time for me to open that tutorial :) Overall this game is a big thumbs up."

Thus what is the point of even caring about global relations? I would like ot add I have played all other civ games from CIV III on up and this one does not add up.

OK so far, but missing a few elements that I've come to expect from a Civ game (e.g. diplomacy) that I hope will be added on in subsequent expansion packs. Biggest downside is AI that doesn't seem to understand how the combat system in its own game works, but the artwork is beautiful and the game is easy to understand but has enough underlying complexity to satisfy those that want to drill down deeper. A few bugs and technical things that mistify me, like a lack of space to view your relationship stateus with another civilization and confusing move system where you end up wasting a lot of move points. Overall this game has the potential to be great, but is missing too many pieces at this point. Civ has done a great job in the past filling in the gaps, however (see Brave New World with Civ V), so I'm optimistic that they'll get it right in a couple expansions. Hold off on paying the huge price tag and see what happens as the expansions roll out."
415,18.4,Recommended, February 4,2,"Contrary to what you might hear, this game is an improvement on Civ 5. The gameplay is more varied, there's more to do during a game, there are better incentives, more paths to take, more difficult choices and so on. I do believe it's genuinely more exciting than it was before. There is definitely a lot of work to be done, but as it stands, it's about on par with Civ 5 complete on the gameplay side of things.With Rise and Fall coming soon, and looking to be a huge step forward, with many gameplay complexities that layer nicely on top of what we already have, it should make for a much more advanced, yet enjoyable Civ.The problems I have with the game, are the frequent crashes and the poor performance. I run an Nvidia gtx 1080 and an AMD Ryzen 1700x and it struggles on max settings in the late game. It's a nice looking map, but reasonably low poly and the background processes should only benefit from an 8 core 3.4ghz processor. It dips to 40fps and you can see the game struggle as you pan across the map.More pressing are the crashes. Playing a single game on prince and standard speed with 6 AI, it has crashed 3 times already and I'm about 70% along the science tree. The crashes can happen at any time, for whatever reason. Just started a map? No problem, here's a crash. Released a nuke, certian that victory is yours? Nope, here's a crash. Funnily enough, the IOS version hasn't crashed on me once and development for that has been outsourced. Firaxis, up your game just a bit please.I feel like I have to address the AI, because it is the most talked about thing when it comes to this game. Yes, the AI is temperamental, yes they are hard to please, but no, they aren't (completely) broken. Having watched a fair bit of gameplay on Youtube to properly understand the game before I dived in, you can see the amount of hoop jumping you may have to do to please a neighbouring nation. The game is intricate and the rules of the game are hefty. You can't just throw money at an AI and think that's enough. You need to understand what they're after first, their leaders needs and how they function, where their placement is on the map, why they would need a certian luxury, what research they may or may not have, sending a scout to see their buildings, etc.Fair enough to that time where that AI was outrageously aggressive towards you, but an overhaul risks a complete dumb down of an intricate system that should be worth it in the end. If you can trust that Firxis will get this right eventually (and there is every chance they can, considering their track record of releasing bug ridden games that become masterpieces) then there is no need to panic, claim sacrilege, cry and everything else I've seen grown adults do over this game.I recommend this game now, if money doesn't mean much to you right now, you like 4X strategies and you don't mind some crashes and gameplay inaccuracies for the time being.Otherwise, wait until everyone changes their tone and for their sake, try to act surprised."

I thought I was going to be bothered by the new art style, but it looks great. Like anything else, the menues and interface take a few minutes to get used to, but thats not necessarily a bad thing.

Civ 5 had workshop but also in-game access to mods. Civ 6 doesn't. You have to go to a different website and manually install.A lot of things are cool - I rather like districts.

111,147.8,Not Recommended," November 16, 2016",2,"Do not buy this game until some of the fundamental issues with it are corrected. I've played every Civilization game since Civilization I and this game is just awful.They have introduced complexity for no reason other than complexity. Just about every subsystem, and especially the civics, religion and city state subsystems, is significantly worse than Civ V and simply don't work. The one exception is the distict subsystem. That's actually good.The graphics are awful as well. You get tiny, tiny icons of cows and sheep that make it impossible to tell what they are. Hills look almost the same as flat land. Even the movement of units has been made annoying as hell. In previous Civ games as long as you had a movement point left you could move into a hex. Now the unit stalls until the next turn if you don't have enough movement.The decisions of the AI make absolutely no sense. AI players declare war on you randomly, denounce you for ridiculous reasons such as you have more Great People than them and generate gobs of units which just clog up the map. City states also generate tons of units which clog things up more and barbarians generate in what seems like every hidden space on the map.The game has so many fundamental issues they should just toss it and start all over again."

The issue is the AIs, and their total irrationality. There is not rhyme or reason to their like or dislikes, and they act like someone who total psychotic as well as bipolar. No matter what AI I play with they start off disliking me and never leave that. I've had AI that I've only met their scouts once show across half the world to declare war on me. There is no deplomacy at all when dealing with them and their total irrationality drives ME crazy.While I like other portions the game besides the AIs, due to my graveyard work schedule I really can only play AI games.

130,168.7,Not Recommended," January 4, 2017",2,"Not recommended. No matter what you do, you get denounced. The stupidest thing is that when you attacked, you fight back and end up taking one of their cities, then you suddenly become a warmonger and no matter how many turns passes, you are still a warmonger. Oh, and even if you are an ally and you have pleased the other nation in every way, you still can get surprised attacked. The alliance system doesn't work. I'm sure these problems will get fixed eventually about a year or two later, but not recommended as of current state."
54,27.1,Not Recommended," January 5, 2017",2,"I found Civ VI to be disappointing. The user interface is clumsy compared to the prior versions. The game requires too much micro-management of individual units, and the game at is slighted against conquest victories. Visually appealing, but for some reason the other leaders are shown as cartoon-like rather than .Ore realistically drawn. Very disappointed with the game play. Maybe after they issue a few DLCs it will improve, but for now I find myself playing Civ V most of the time."
74,210.4,Recommended," October 22, 2016",2,"It's got a great early to mid game. You actually have much more leeway to decide how to build a civilization.Examples: You don't really need to get useless technologies like previous games. I didn't learn how to build the most basic boats until the industrial era, just because the techs I actually need weren't entirely dependent on previous techs in the tree. Like you can get several science techs before getting any military or economic techs.Districts also help a lot. You can't build every district early because there are population limits to how many you can build, but where you build them first also really matters. Like if I care about science I'll put my science district near my capital, but also with a few flat tiles nearby to put universities or wonders on, since they all require their own tiles. Later I'll make an economic district, but I won't have a place to build a couple buildings so I will never be making as much money as I would if I built it first.Also, the government is more complex. You can build different into 10 different governments, each with there own advantages and policies that all have a serious impact on how you do things.Lastly, the city states are cooler. The straight benefits are greater, and no real 'random benefits', which was a major reason to use them in the last game. In particular, if you're an ally of a city state you can pay them a reasonable fee to take control of their entire army for 15 turns, which is huge as they usually have about 5 units. So if you have one nearby, you don't have to worry about suprise attacks as much since you can have a decent army at your disposal within the turn.Those changes make a major impact early to mid game, but if you get to the final stages they tend to matter less overall.My biggest gripe, by far, is that the AI is idiotic. It tends to be annoying with stupid demands, they may constantly declare war on you, but they tend to be terrible at actually waging war. They may ask to trade my 'open borders and luxery resource' for 3 gold total, but then i'll ask to make it even, and they'll demand all my luxery resources, open borders, and 180 gold. But not offer anything. Like they'll interupt my playing to send me that stupid a trade."
164,84.1,Recommended," October 22, 2016",2,"I've been a Civ fan since the first one--on Super Nintendo. Overall, I'd say the game is good; I don't drop 25 hours over 2 days if I'm not enjoying myself!There are a few things I really enjoyed, and a few things that I find frustrating. These may or may not matter to you:Graphics: Mixed bag here. The cartoon style for the main map and structures is dreadful--the trees look absolutely ridiculous, and the mountains aren't much better. It really does look like a mobile game in many respects, and there's nothing positive about that. However, the fog of war styling is GREAT! It looks like an old parchment map, with decorative features; it's nice to look at. And the leader animations/backgrounds are definitely eye candy. The detail on the leader backgrounds stands in stark contrast to the unpleasantly simplistic main map graphics.Research and civics: I LOVE the changes here. The things you do in the game can affect your research speed--killing enemies with a sling unit can increase the speed of archery development, for example. They've also returned to having forms of government, and this affects which kind and how many bonuses you can stack. It's more freeform, allowing a lot of flexibility in getting the bonuses to fit your play style. I think this is easily the best advancement in the Civ series.Workers: This is one part where I think they failed miserably. Workers were replaced with a builder unit. It can only construct 3 tile improvements, and then it disappears for no real reason. (Kind of like a state disbanding its road crew every few years and paying to start from scratch again each time.) While they build improvements instantly, you'll need to waste more city build time creating them. And they no longer build roads--that was split out into a military engineer unit, and happens automatically with trade units. If you like forcing the world to be shaped to your whims, you'll find this to be very obnoxious.Great People: There's been a very positive revamp here. There are more categories of great people, and they actually do a variety of useful things. Some create great works which bring in tourists, others help you speed up wonder construction, or claim new tiles. They also feel more unique than they did in Civ V.Religion: This feature has been greatly expanded over past titles. You can found the usual religions, or create a custom religion with custom bonuses. You also create special units that engage in theological warfare--""combat"" without being at war, in addition to spreading your religion and stamping out competing religions. It's an interesting mechanic, but it also gets tedius when Ghandi sends constant wave after wave of these units in to deal with, lest he convert your cities...Soundtrack: I haven't really noticed it during my games. Nothing too exciting here. Might be a disappointment for some. I even checked a few times to make sure that music volume was up. I have to say that they also included the absolute worst rendition I've ever heard of Tourdion--the French medieval music. The music stands out as the least polished feature of the game. I recommend having a decent Spotify playlist going while you play."

All in all, I have a lot to learn but im catching on.PROS:-Good cartoony style graphics, looks great.-Smart AI who WILL take advantage of your weaknesses and mistakes.-Diverse leaders and bonuses for each.-Revamped religion with an interesting twist to stradegy.-Fresh concepts with the districts and wonders.-Great people earned in different ways offering a challenge/race to aquire them.-Movement overhaul enhancing combat and the way you get around the map.CONS:-Districts take a lot of space and leave less hammers, food, science, etc. to be had on tiles.-Building wonders is a secondary goal with steep requirements and space they take on tiles.-Cities are constantly unhappy because of lack of entertainment districts, entertainment district almost required in every city.To sum it all up, there are a lot of new concepts to the game, like, amenitites, religious combat, and districts. All of these things can be a bit confusing at first and frustrate you. Also, CIV V strategies will almost always NOT work in this CIV. The AI are smarter and the gameplay is way different.Once patches and more DLC come out, this game will rival all previous CIV games, and definitely surpass the likes of CIV V.Final Rate:9/10"

The new districts and culture tech tree are great ideas but I don't understand anything else about this game. I'm still shocked that in the SIXTH iteration of this game they for some reason threw any idea of ""balance"" out the window. It's not even worth ranting about the balance issues because you can't even play multiplayer anyway! I take that back, you can play a multiplayer game of Civ 6 with friends after spending 60$+ on the game for about 1 - 50 turns. After that you will need to resync... or reload the entire game EVERY.

The new combat system as idea is great (no more 100 units in 1 slot) howeverAI is not able to make any good logic how to use army. A small outdated unit in passage can stop whole army because if not killed right away other units cannot attack. Computer sometimes will move untis in random direction without clear target.Removing transport units for sea and allowing ay unit to swim is another bad move.The whole game lost balance because of that.

72,186.5,Not Recommended," June 27, 2017",2,"This is a great game. On launch, I feel like Civ VI is much more complete than Civ V was. There is religious victories and the leaders have many interesting new abilities not seen in Civ V. The developers changed the movement mechanics in a way I feel makes much more sense than in Civ V. The districts are a wonderful addition to the game, making city placement even more important than in Civ V. This mechanic promotes more awareness for future city development and victory conditions.The only thing I was disappointed with at launch was the AI relationship with the player. The diplomacy is not as fleshed out as it should be. However, the cultural, religous, and military interactions with the AI is not really inhibited by this, so I was not very put out. When the DLC began to be released however, I was angry. In what world is $5 for a civilization fair? There are no real gameplay additions with these DLC packs. If the customers of Civ V were charge $5 for every civilization the developers added to the game, no one would have bought Civ VI.Maybe they are not planning on Civ VII because at $5 per DLC civ, I will not be buying."

358,14.4,Not Recommended," May 8, 2017",2,"While the phrase ""dumbed down"" has been somewhat watered down over the years, I feel it applies for me to Civ VI. I have happily sunk hundreds and hundreds of hours into earlier Civ games, but this... I just can't.Everything from the art style, to the UI, to the game mechanics, to the presentation... everything seems to cater to a younger demographic.My main gripes (and their descriptions) with the game are (in no particular order):Art styleAnimations (look at the leaders, how they move and gesture while talking, as a fantastic example) and colors (the world isn't pastel) are exaggerated, buildings and units look like caricatures of themselves.Tile system and city buildingWhile it may seem like an interesting idea to have districts take up a tile space, deciding what tiles to use for what districts QUICKLY becomes an absolute chore. Optimizing is an extreme pain in the behind, and, in addition, building variety has dropped A LOT. Going from a plethora of buildings available in earlier games (with less restrictions on where and when to build them), there are only a very small number available, and they're limited to specific districts. Probably my largest problem with the game, by far.Worker and tile developmentClosely related to the above, tile development is almost an equal pain - that workers have limited amounts of actions before getting destroyed is such a ridiculous mechanical decision (artificial ""depth"" by introducing an arbitrary limit, yay), and their use is more limited than in earlier games as well - that they can't build roads is such an immensely stupid decision. Lack of automation and improvement options to me is a huge drawback.Not an awful game, but it's certainly not good. Roughly a 5/10, buy if it drops under $/€/£10."

Why on the standard difficulty would a nation in the modern era build an entire army of spearmen?! WHY?! Come on.This game is painful to play and I can't bring myself to continue playing. It's depressingly thin. No more maps included, so expect to play ♥♥♥♥♥♥ random maps forever until a third party fills the gaps for a company that screwed you.

While I applaud the developers for their innovative attempt with the AI character traits to define their dispositions, the idea has not been executed well. Often other countries are upset with you for things you cannot know and will hate you forever if you declare war. In most games, all AI have denounced all other AI and the player. Thus what is the point of even caring about global relations? I would like ot add I have played all other civ games from CIV III on up and this one does not add up. I would advise waiting to buy until the developers crawl out of the hole they work in, sober up, and read the community feedback. Bring in modding support now, not later so the community can get this game back on track."

The unfinished AI, Diplomacy and other features, clearly left open to be finished in DLC, are begging you to waste your money.And it is a waste. So far the DLC is basic stuff that should have been in the base game. The game is nowhere near ready for DLC, but hey This is Civ, the business model is sell 1/3rd the game for over full price, then drip feed the rest of the game and charge for it.It really has gone too far this time though, the base game doesn't hold any interest, and the DLC is just boring."

OK so far, but missing a few elements that I've come to expect from a Civ game (e.g. diplomacy) that I hope will be added on in subsequent expansion packs. Biggest downside is AI that doesn't seem to understand how the combat system in its own game works, but the artwork is beautiful and the game is easy to understand but has enough underlying complexity to satisfy those that want to drill down deeper. A few bugs and technical things that mistify me, like a lack of space to view your relationship stateus with another civilization and confusing move system where you end up wasting a lot of move points. Overall this game has the potential to be great, but is missing too many pieces at this point. Civ has done a great job in the past filling in the gaps, however (see Brave New World with Civ V), so I'm optimistic that they'll get it right in a couple expansions. Hold off on paying the huge price tag and see what happens as the expansions roll out."

263,546.5,Recommended," November 25, 2017",2,"I've liked previous entries into the series and I do like this one too. While it doesn't shine like it's predecessor, it does have some good points. Deciding where to build your districts and improving them adds a layer to the game that I thought was a nice touch from a city building perspective. Mods do not disable achievements, which is one of the few gripes I had about Civ5.Diplomacy is terrible in this game. If you don't care about diplomacy and you're like me, knowing you're going to wipe out every faction including city states anyway, then that might now bother you. But I got to say it is annoying it takes so little to get denounced in the game, and happens often. I've tried actively building relations with another faction in this game, and it isn't easy and when I have managed to do it, it doesn't last long before you're going back down hill. Then there's the cartoony artstyle. Which feels like a step backwards when you compare it to Civ5. That being said, I've played some games with more cartoony visuals that I liked a great deal. So that in and of itself isn't totally a bad thing. But it does turn some people off. I was more open to it given previous games I've played that had similar approaches to that aspect, but coming directly from Civ5 to Civ6 was an adjustment.I'm recommending it because despite the things that bother me about the game, I can still have a good time with it. Some things can be offset by the talented people making mods for the game. A game shouldn't have to depend on it's modding community to make up for its faults, however. But at least it's there."
63,394.6,Recommended," October 21, 2016",2,"As an fan of the Civilization series, in fact one who still thinks Civ II was the greatest for its time and era, Civilization VI is a very well done game, at least from what I see for the limited amount of hours I have put into this game. There is ofcourse a lot of ""Un-Learning"" and also with the new districts the game will seem to take one out of their comfort zone and familiarity of the mechanics we have grown used to playing prior versions of the game. Its this very uncomfort that can either be viewed as positive or a negative by players and probably the reason some have stated that its a step down from Civ. 5. Toi me these un familiar aspects makes the game challenging and also rewarding. I like the sort of integration of civics and science and also how one needs to grow the cities to grow the empire, which means this game involves planning never seen before in civilization series.I must admit I cannot understand why we are not allowed to rename cities (or maybe I have not figured it out as yet) and I also am grapling with finding out some reports I would like to see such as list of all units in ones army, or maybe they dont exist, maybe its time for me to open that tutorial :) Overall this game is a big thumbs up."

I have created vast empires across the years, but now with Civ6, I have been able to strategize to my victory in greater depth than previously imaginable. Now with unstacked cities, and a much more intensive focus on the map, each city can be more specialized. Civ6 feels more natural in gameplay compared to its predecessors. For example, the new road mechanics are more historically-realistic; roads are made acoording to where trade happens.

I gave them until now to fix the issues with the game before I wrote a review and this is all I have ever had to say about this game:It has completely broken AI and a crapload of dlc.Everything I have read about the terrible AI in other reviews is true. If they do not fix the AI in this game there is no way I will buy the next one.This game is not even worth the cheapest of sales...I mean, if you find it on the street you should just throw it in the garbage. Buy Civ 5 and thank me later."
297,13.6,Recommended, January 22,2,"This is an incredible strategy game. But it lacks in living up to the incredible standards set by Civ V and Civ IV.Lots of people seem to complain about the AI being horrible, but the AI is basically the same as in every other civ game, but they just have these things called Agendas now. Agendas are policies that each specific civ leader will follow. An example is Trajan, Trajan likes civs that have a larger amount of land than he does, but he dislikes ones that are smaller. Every leader has their own specific one, and you need to learn to play around them. Lots of leaders will have agendas that contradict with other leaders agendas. So unlike in Civ 5 you can't just be friendly with everyone. You have to pick out a set few civs you wish to be your allies, and stick with them and follow their agendas. This can be seen as a good or a bad thing depending on your playstyle.Another large difference in this game than in Civ 5 is the unit movement. The new way the movement system works is that you have a set amount of movement points for each unit. In civ 5 if you used 1 movement point to go onto a flat tile, you could still use the leftover movement point to move onto any other adjacent tile. But if your first move was into any other rough terrain than you would be out of movement points. In Civ 6, you can't use the 1 extra movement point in the same way as in civ 5. Flat terrain takes 1 point, and rough takes 2. If you use one movement point to move onto a flat tile near a hill, you cannot move onto the hill tile adjacent because you only have 1 movement point left. Most people don't like this new system as it makes unit movement horribly slow. And the roads were changed so they don't help as much either. This basically constricts you to using cavalry units so you can actually move around the landscape in a reasonable amount of time.One other huge difference is cities. There are 2 ways to build your empire, tall and wide. Tall is when you have only 3-5 cities with a very high population, while wide is to have tons of cities with little population. Civ 5 heavily favored tall empires, while civ 6 heavily favors wide. This is mainly due to the science and culture change. There are no more ""policies"" but instead there are 2 tech trees. One running off culture and the other running off science. In Civ 5 you didnt want a lot of cities because it slowed your science and culture production due to cost of policies and techs increasing the more cities you have, it was also beneficial to have a lot of population in your cities because of how the science buildings worked (Library, National College, etc.). In Civ 6, there is no penalty. You have to make as many cities as possible, and just put down tons of campuses and theater districts to generate science and culture. This will be a huge change to those going from Civ 5 to Civ 6. I personally like building wide empires more as it gives more land control and actually feels like you are trying to control and expand your empire.TL;DR: This game is incredibly different in playstyle from Civ 5 and will take getting used too, but is fun nonetheless.If the movement system is changed and if they add some more non DLC civs, then this game might rival civ 5. But as of now Civ 5 is clearly superior."
38,47.2,Not Recommended, January 20,2,"Civilization VI is off to a solid start, however as is expected there is much to improve and a few things that simply feel wrong. While some may not like comparisons to CIV V given it's had allot of time to be refined, that game is also not perfect and could be improved. However I'm surprised some of the things it did right, did not come over to civ VI.At first the art style was ""in your face"" different, in a bad way but over time it's kind of grown on me. However some may struggle with the yield icons as they're small and hard to make out for me. A harsher dark outline would make seeing them far easier for both me and others who have trouble seeing them.The different lenses are absolutely fantastic. Being able to see the appeal of my tiles, my religious spread and where it's coming from/going to as well as the settler lense are all welcome additions. However for AI games I feel a ""wanted territory"" lense is despeartely needed so players can avoid expanding on a different continent, in the opposite direction only for the civ they promised not to expand towards get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off and declare war in the near future. This would also reveal AI flaws (EG if every single hex was off limits)The districts system is new and interesting. I've enjoyed trying to figure out which districts should take priority and it adds some satisfaction to city management. I feel there's too stark a difference between the good and not so good districts. A faith district is there purely for making a religion and I feel is shoved to the side when the 2 trading districts or the science/culture/hammer districts come into play. Still allot to figure out, just hoping there can be multiple viable pathways as currently there is a cookie cut way to do things as there was in civ V.From the civics, the ease with which military tech units are obtained, the need for walls to be able to shoot barbs, the sheer strength of barbs and the fact that there're more military civs than passive ones screams of the devs trying to force conflict to occur.While there're only 2 more military civs than passive ones it may not seem so bad, but when taking into account how bleh so many of the passive civ abilites feel in stark contrast to civilization V's civs, it's pretty god dam awful for those who preffered a pacifist approach.The civic system is an addition I didn't enjoy as much as I thought I would. It looked like a flexible, more customisable option but is hindered by its tech tree structure and narrow range of card abilities.In civ V, you start your tradition/liberty tree with a little boost, then gain something more upon it's completion rocketing you civ forward. Complete the piety, patronage, aesthetics or rationalism had the same effect depending on what you were up to. Add in it's contribution to encouraging war with an abundance of combat based cards.I feel no such impact or satisfaction here, and far less flexibility in getting to what I want (which there is an extreme lack of) given it now functions as a tech tree. This may be a ""love it or hate it"" thing, and unfortunately I'm in the hate it boat. The civ V policy trees were simply better.The science tree feels narrower and is unecesarily stretched out with overly large lines. It looks bad and feels bad to navigate, as you can't see what leads to where.While the micro management of civs it fun and all, the housing/amenities system absolutely crushes any hope of building a tall civilization. While I don't mind wonders taking up hexes, as they look sweet, like a trophy on my land, this addition only emphasises how poor a choice building tall is in civ VI, further cutting down on the avaliable options and making your civilization more optimiased to mass producing units for war.Religion also took a hit in civ VI. Many of the pantheon beliefs seem, to be quite frank,♥♥♥♥♥♥ Very few are linked to a luxury resource as in civ V and many revolve around certain terrain, most of which can be removed by an enemy or providing boosts to your military.An extremely prominent annoyance are the constant requests from AI's. Every time they send you a delegation, which is very gawd dam common you get a pretty, little cinematic. Add in multiple AI and you'll be spending more time spamming the ESC key than playing the game. I simply don't care about maming AI happy anymore, because it's so tedious and infuriating to do. Am quite shocked there's no option to disable the cinematic menus.Movement in civ VI is an extreme downfall compared to its predecessor. Instead of spending w/e movement u have left to move onto a hill, you simply won't move onto a woods/forest/hill. I found it extremely irritating being constantly told to move my units when they can't complete a turn without moving in the opposite direction due terrain being in the way and this really slows down the pace of the game, makes retrieving workers/settlers from barbs nigh impossible without going to their camp and simply feels awful in practice.Civilization VI will undoubtedly be improved in the future in many ways, but unless the issues I have with it are not only fixed but improved drastically, it will be very very difficult to justify the pay wall these fixes will be locked behind. And given their emphasis in forcing you to go to war, and my hate for the tediousness by which combat functions I'm likely to stick to civiliation V with my pacifistic science/cultural victories.. I reccomend similar players do the same as there's simply more fun to be had with civilization V for now."

228,40.7,Recommended," October 30, 2016",2,"I really like this game. I like the Artwork and Atmosphere and I think the changes with the districts was a great Idea. Sadly the ""intelligent"" AI is as I actually kind of expected not really that smart. I would really like to vote for ""needs some rework"", but as that doesn't exist I will vote for recommend, as all in all it's fine. I mean I always like the civ series, but the AI is kind of always bothering me. Also I'm not that happy with some of the fighting mechanics.So, what bothers me about the AI (I played twice on emporer)?Trading with the AI can be horrible. I mean sometimes you can try to give them 2 luxury ressources for 1 and even then they're not happy. Then again you can get your spies back for 1 gold over 25 turns, despite you just ignored them when they asked you not to spy in their territory.They're lack of overall strategy. I was at war with an AI, they attacked the city state I was allied with and killed all units there. After that they just continued without even pillaging something (including my trade routes). Other situation, I declared war and tried to attack a city. I saw that he was coming with quite some units and retreated a bit. He just keept attacking me for some time with single units and after that I took the city without problems. Another situation I had a completly defensless city (I got it from a peace treaty earlier) and declared war because I wanted his capitol and did expect to loose my city, but I didn't care. Well he didn't even attack my city -.- It's totally oblivious to the hole Situation and I actually wouldn't even mind if the AI would cheat here a bit more in sense of information.The agendas of the different AI's have sometimes really weird triggers and I have the feeling that it hinders them sometimes to work together because they have each other as much as me. It really needs some mechanics that they're working together also if they hate themself. I mean in my second game I was warmongering the whole time, but noone really cared. One declared war on me, but never attacked... I mean the only reason I made peace sometimes was because the unhapiness of my towns would skyrocket with warweariness. I personally think a city shouldn't have warweariness if it's not really close to the battles and there is no counter war propaganda (new options for spies?).Now something about the combat system. I really don't like it how it is now. This adding of stats is absolutely stupid. I had the situation where I didn't want to attack a catapult with my legion, because it would just have been a minor victory or so. His unit had defender of the belief (+10 melee strengh) makes with basic stats 33 melee vs 40 melee + he gets his +2 from the difficulty so it's already on 35, a standard swordsman. Meaning also the catapult does probably more damge when defending against an attack then when doing a ranged attack... This is just ridiculous. Stuff like this happens when you try to make stuff to simple. It makes sense to have stats, but I would strictly divide stats and bonus damage. Stats are used to compute a basic damage and afterwards you get some boni lets say for AT against tanks (in percent of the base damage). The stats would be only the main stats + unit upgrades"

What really excites me, though, is that there is even more to come in terms of content. However, In spite of all its upsides, there are still a few glaring issues.Pros:Many interesting and unique playable characters - Most Civs/Leaders have enough going to make themselves stand outImportant decisions - From placing districts to choosing policies to managing era score, there's always something new to considerGood performance - Somehow, this game loads faster and runs better than Civ V on my PCLiving world - Civ VI really makes its maps feel alive, with empires ebbing and flowing as the centuries passFulfilling Experience - Civ VI R&F has done something uncommon in its series; creating rounds that are interesting from turn oneall the way to victoryIt's Civ - The franchise is so solid that its basic precepts remain fun, no matter how flawed the individual entry isModding - Civ's amazing community pulls through again. Combined with Firaxis' modding tools, the Steam Workshop flourishes once againNeutral:""Unique"" visual style - Love it or hate it, Civ VI looks very different from Civ V, being cartoony and exaggeratedVarious design quirks - There are too many to detail, but it's up to you to decide whether you like being able to wipe out other Civs 10 turns into the game, or pouring dozens of turns into underwhelming wondersPassable AI - The computer foes are generally sensible, and know how to manage themselves, but are certainly no genuisesCons:Broken user interface - Wonky edge scrolling, obfuscated information, text being covered up, and a useless minimapModerate glitchiness - From small visual errors, to wonky starting positions to random crashing, it's not uncommon to play a game of Civ VI and experience some kind of issuePrice point - Yes, it's a modern AAA title.

It is a better game, the dlc is cheaper now, and overall a better game. Still, if you were into Civ 5, chances are you will enjoy this game."
45,126.4,Recommended, February 1,2,"The more I play Civ VI, the more I am liking it.If you're looking for an upgraded, new, polished version of Civ V, then this is not what you're getting and you're going to be disappointed if that's what you're looking for.On the other hand, if you're willing to give it a shot, the new mechanics and the new ways to do certain things become more and more fun. So to sum things up, here's a pros and cons list after a few games:Pros:- Graphically beautiful game- New ways to manage the tiles in your city, takes some getting used to (+ City Management)- New battle animations- The tiles on which wonders can be built are restricted depending on the wonder- Tons of new resourcesCons:- Weak A.I., especially in the lower difficulties- Some playthroughs can be ruined due to intensive barbarian spawning early on- Not Civ V (if that's what you're looking for)- Feels relatively easier than past Civs, noob friendlyOverall,I find Civ VI is a nice, refreshing addition to the series that suceeded with many of the new implementations. You just have to go at it with an open mind and give things a try. New mechanics like traders building your roads are pretty good too. One thing however, is that enemy A.I. will engage in such silly battles. Like you'll have a unit with full health and a general on top of it, and the ai will still attack you with a lower tier unit that has like 10 health, killing themselves in the process. Other than a few small things here and there, the pros shine bright enough to make for a very good Civ, with lots of potential to improve it even more.8.5/10"
67,76.2,Recommended, February 3,2,"Civilization VI follows the traditional Civilization gameplay style. I don't think that needs any further introductions at this point so let's move on to the differences between this and its predecessor.As of course can be expected, the game got a graphical update. What I really enjoyed is the feature of building districts and you deciding where to place them. It actually makes a strategic difference where you decide to place them. Another improvement I enjoyed is that the AI became more unique personalities. Every faction has a 'personality'. For example some will be more inclined to attack you while you grow in power, while others will like you more as you grow in power. A last point I want to adress is how roads are build, roads are build by creating trade routes. This makes routes more of a strategic decision as well. Will I trade with my enemy to create routes so I can attack them faster when I'm ready? Or is the risk too great they will do it to me?However the game is far from ready from being polished. The AI's unique personalities sometimes manage to turn into an unpredictable teenager: Declaring war on you one turn and offering peace quite soon after again. The game is more limited than it's predecessor too, due to expansions and many DLC's the previous ones has.The game however is heading the right direction. As expansions continue and DLC's will get added Civilization VI will be ready to rival it predecessor. Assuming they don't forget to polish the AI and balances."
266,16.9,Recommended," November 28, 2016",2,"Civ VI still holds true to the Civ formula and this iteration does not disappoint. The new art style is enjoyable (and more friendly to weaker machines). Simple changes to movement have made movement more tactical and makes exploration a longer term project then in Civ 5. Overall, this is a worthy entry to the series and I feel it is well worth the asking price."
400,54.6,Not Recommended," October 23, 2016",2,"Between scouts not starting with the ability to move freely through rough terrain, rough terrain not enterable if you only have one move point left, and not being able to build roads wherever you want, my scouts are only moving like one tile per turn. What's the point? Might as well have a horse do their job.Also the fog of war map, while a cool concept, is really visually indistinct. The unexplored parts are the same color as the explored-but-unseen parts and it's really irritating.Workers can only build three things. Then you have to build another worker! Between this and the scouts, the early game is much slower than civ 4 and 5.All that being said, as far as I can tell the developers appear to be listening to a few of the complaints (they eventually put the ability to name your cities back in, which wasn't in from the start for some reason), so it'll likely eventually be worth buying. Maybe wait until after the expansions are released."
214,80.6,Not Recommended," October 26, 2016",2,"At this point, Civilization VI is a watered down version of V that fixed one flaw of the previous game, but enhanced the endless endgame and the terrible diplomacy.Just so you know where I'm coming from--I loved Civilization Revolution and that got me started on Civ V. It was a beautiful game and a nice step up from the simplicity of Revolution while maintaining the same feel. However, after playing a round or two the problems became clear. That being said, I still enjoyed it enough to play hundreds of hours. I can't say the same for VI.Civilization VI moves the happiness system back into the background so it's no longer an issue, but the diplomacy is worse than V was. No matter how you treat your allies, the moment the alliance ends they will join the denouncing circle of poo that always seems to form. Every turn you will be denounced by the people you just fought off for being a warmonger--until they declare war on you, only to loose--and then everyone else declares war as well.In short, while I enjoy aspects of this game, I won't even bother to play it again except as a guilty pleasure for the short fun periods of initially arranging your empire before you have to deal with the endless slog of stupid AIs and the ten hours it takes to actually finish things. /End Rant."

Why pay full price to line their pockets for a half baked game... It will also drop in price with time, so just as an added bonus! Now with that out of the way. About the game: I can sum it up in one word. Pointless. I have always enjoyed the Civ series, but this version really doesn't offer much value. I'm not a fan of the sprawl effect. I really didn't find the micromanagement that came with selection city tiles enjoyable. And I hated the fact that the tech tree only went so far. There was so much room for more that could have been designed into it. At least some near future tech would have been fun to build and play with. Civ 5 went farther and was by far the more interesting. But if your a fan, by all means try it. Just wait until a more stable release and the eventual price drop!"
143,228.0,Not Recommended," October 23, 2016",2,"I'm a huge fan of the Civ series so I'm really sorry to not be able to recommend this game.The AI is what makes Civ a great strategy game series; whether it's the backstabbing Montezuma, the calculating Queen Elizabeth or the reliable old friend Ghandhi -- they're your opponents. The very artificial intelligence in Civ 6 cannot win battles, accept (or offer) good deals for both parties, and is schizophrenically erratic where it comes to decisions of war and peace.On my very first and only game (on prince -- where the AI and I are on equal footing), I managed to have war declared on me twice and I built fewer than ten military units the whole game. The first time I easily conquered France (who declared war on me for some reason), while the second time Greece accused me of sending missionaries into their territory -- which I didn't even do. After conquering them both without losing a single unit, I decided to focus on technology. At the point I reached the atomic age, I realized that culture was like tech for civics. Ooops. And then I got a message that my largest rival Civ (who had a greater population) had just entered the Renaissance.The AI can't even beat me in my first game -- how is this a challenge? People gave Mafia 3 terrible reviews despite the solid graphics, great voice acting, and fun basic mechanics mostly becausse of a terminally moronic AI. That's very much the case here as the sound track, leader animinations, voiceovers, and possibly good mechanics (we'll never know without a worthy opponent). However, at least in Mafia 3 the AI had discovered gunpowder before I finished the game."

They have almost zero bearing on how you play the game.This is especially insulting, considering the Community has spent years detailing feedback on what the main game's issues are.Here's a brief overview of what has not been fixed:- The AI is still batshit insane.- The Tech-Tree is still wonky and allows for startling beelining. You'll still see Caravels around before the AI even researches basic ironworking.- The production costs are still too high. Building anything takes forever.- The AI still can't hold its own in a fight."

(combining up to three of the same units together)- The faith and diplomacy are great and will be better once the few bugs have been fixed with it and when they expand on it- Love the new map layout/design as well as the character models.- All the difficulties are harder than in previous games which is a nice addition- Game feels like CIV 5 with a major upgrade in a very good way-Love that you dont get as bad effects of having multiple cities, you can make as many cities to your hearts content without any major debuffs affecting you- A downside would be that the AI need adjusting, they sometimes get angry for no reason or make very very unfair trade offers, for example AI: Give me all your resources and 30 gold per turn for 90 turns and i will give you 1 gold, and while your at it you might as well give me 4 of your cities. With saying that you can still alter the deals to make them more fair and they will generally accept the deal- Another downside is that the Teams option isnt implamented in the game yet in multiplayer and singleplayer modes, but you can alter a game file to activate the Teams option on bothOverall i think the game is amazing and cant wait for DLC to come out to expand the game even further"
571,41.2,Recommended," October 21, 2016",2,"Still in the early stages of playing the game, but the majority of the gameplay complaints the few negative reviews levels against this game are wholey false.-The graphics are improved over Civ 5. There's just no actual arguement to be made here they are simply objectively better. You might not like the continued use of the cartoony art style that Civ has been using lately, but the quality of the graphics themselves are improved. Period. You can argue not liking the aesthetic choices but STYLE is not GRAPHIC QUALITY.-The game is not ""dumbed down"". To say that is just bordering on the absurd. With the inclusion of districts, housing, amenities and the removal of global happiness (bringing it to the city level) city building is far more complicated then ever, and since old ""plop down city, automate it, done."" mechanic that's been around since 3 or 4 has been done away with builders have become more important. They now require attention as every improvement they do (or don't do in lieu of a district) matters as builders can only produce limited improvements before expiring.-The game is not ""lacking content"". To be perfectly honest this is about as close as I've seen of any video game released that manages to shove in as much of the previous game's DLC as it could into the base package at launch.There are, however, a few actual problems with the game.-No city renaming. I just...can't fathom why this isn't in the game. Who the hell wants to lead the German empire and NOT have the capital be Berlin? When I play multiplayer with friends how am I supposed to rename cities for comical or taunting effect? Really now, was this THAT hard to program in?-AI is quirky. The AI in EVERY 4x sucks in my opinion so I can't really put to much weight on this.-UI scaling is locked. I don't know, maybe I'm getting old but I really can't stand playing a game with tiny text that makes me squint to read it. As it is the UI doesn't take up much room, I would of been thrilled if I could make it larger so I could actually read all the information infront of me.-Not thrilled with the leader choices. I mean sure seeing the same people over and over again gets boring, but really I'd rather have an Otto Von Bismark for Germany and I kinda miss Stalin leading Russia. This is pretty nitpicky I realize but yeah, just not pleased with the mostly c-list historic leaders. *EDIT* After playing a bit more the leaders I previously didn't really care for on paper have grown on me. They are often animated in ways that actually make them pretty damn endearing, especially Cleopatra and Catherine de Medici.-Religious spread is now much more of a mystery. I have no idea how it spreads, how far it spreads and frankly being CONSTANTLY harassed by eight Christian apostles from my neighbors running through my land screaming ""HAVE YOU HEARD THE GOOD NEWS?!"" gets really annoying really fast. Religious combat is a nice addition though I'll admit.Overall I see no reason to ever go back to Civ 5, it's that good and I'm excited to see where they go with future DLC."

28,482.2,Recommended," November 11, 2016",2,"Civ VI will take me a long time to assess properly, but here are some early observations:Positive observations:-Sean Bean.-The district minigame puzzle has got potential.-The wonders are pretty.-Gold is easier to get, and plays a bigger role (cities are not always quite as dependent on hammers).-The AI agendas (visible and hidden) is a good idea.-Standard game speed seems a lot slower now, I no longer have to play on epic or marathon.Neutral observations:-There is a lot of early aggression. Barbs and AI make it very risky indeed to prioritize early expansion over building a strong military. In some games I get crushed in 50 turns by 20-30 units large AI armies. Sometimes barb camps start massive invasions pre turn 10. It is hard to imagine any way to defend properly against that.-The AI prioritize founding a religion. In order to get one of your own, you usually need to build holy site very early, even if your capital is not suited for one.-It is profitable to sell builders once they have got only one charge left, and just buy a new one. I'm not sure if this expliot is intentional or not, but it seems odd.-The randomness in the early game has got huge variation. Sometimes you can steal two settlers and build a huge empire unchallenged, other times you get overrun by five barb camps from turn 3.Negative observations:-There is a lot of info missing. I can't tell when my borders are going to expand. The wiki explains what stuff IS, not how it works (like it explains what envoys are, but not how you generate them).-There is too much to do in the early game, and next to nothing for your cities to do from mid game and onwards (other than building armies).-AI starts complaining about my civ being weak or lacking culture and whatnot pre turn ten. Give me a break, will you? I'm still building my first slinger.-Gameplay is too one dimentional. You need to build large armies and crush everyone.

377,22.5,Not Recommended, February 11,2,"Let me start off by saying that I bought the Deluxe Edition because I am a huge fan of the Civilization series and I was really excited for a new release. My first match was a great disappointment, mostly because a lot of mechanics had changed. But those you can definitely get used to as I did. Afterall, they're not bad, just unusually different coming from the previous titles. The fact that workers are getting used up now was an interesting move to prevent your civ from ending up with a bunch of them towards the late game with nothing to do.What I couldn't get used to is the annoying cartoony style that felt like a downgrade from Civ5, frequent multiplayer desyncs which apparently are normal enough for the devs to announce on the forums that all you have to do is save and rehost (seriously? what's next? just meet up in person and play the game on a board?) - and last but not least the AI which STILL blatantly cheats instead of applying any strategy at all.All the AI does is brainless subsidized mass-production of units (Gilgamesh: ""A sale on War-Carts you say? *eyeswiden"") and random attacking everything that moves. Spreading religion has also never been easier for the AI because they appear out of nowhere with 10 prophets who are scrambling to all get into THE SAME CITY; now two I could still understand, heck, maybe even three for good measure if you're currently at war with that particular civilization, but THIS?Have they fixed any of this since the release 1 1/2 years ago? Of course not, that would be insane. Makes MUCH more sense charging 5-9 euro for yet another leader with a few scenarios that I will never play. Not sure if they're actually oblivious to their player base or are outright insulting us.I regret purchasing this game, especially as a deluxe edition; for which I was hoping to receive proper expansion packs, as opposed to a few extra civilizations that I could not care any less about because they don't really add anything to the game. All in all, Civ VI is a grave disappointment and from the looks of it will remain to be just that.They should have just given Civ5 a slight UI facelift, worked on its performance and on making the AI a little more believable (Really just for the case of you protecting a small civilization throughout history, them having maybe 5% of your size tops and yet declare war on you? Please, I'd love to understand their suicidal reasoning.) - Anyway, that I would have gladly paid for.I'm also still waiting for the trivial option to have the game show the actual event probabilities! The devs may think they are doing players a favor showing us 33% when it's really 50% or 90% when it really is 100% and provide an artificially even distribution of events, but that initial feeling of ""nice, I still made it"" lasts exactly a few battles before you realize that the game thinks you're stupid."

155,70.7,Not Recommended," February 2, 2017",2,"jan. 2nd - 17this is a game very close to a full reccommendation. in the beginning hours you are glued to your computer, the ""just one more turn"" philosophy in these games are as present as ever. smart changes such as the road system has been inplemented and builders now create tile improvements instantly while now having limitided uses instead. this creates new options for optimizations of your empire. one major thing holds this title back though. its the AI. both in terms of combat and diplomacy. the ai will declare random wars and denounce you galore, but unless you are really far behind it it doesnt even try to mount attacks, and if you yourself takes one of their cities, everyone will think you are a warmonger aand denounces you, even though you were the defenderthis leads to later games where everyone hates you, but it takes nothing to defeat them since you can sit back and declare a ceasefire after x amount of turns without the enemy even having touched your borders. making allies in this is tough and not even usefull since they are so inactive anyways.your first impressions are gonna be great, but this shortcoming is propably gonna ruin it for you after 20 or so hourse, when you start to seee these things.that being said. everything else just works and it feels like, in terms of features that this game has already had the content from the civ 5 expansions packed into it. so the foundation is good and i would dare say that when firaxis finally decides to get the AI to work this will be one, if not THE finest vanilla civ game to date. untill then though, go play civ 5 with the expansions and you have a better product there, purely because the AI works there. then check back later and you can propalby grab this for a lot less by then for a product you can enjoy not just in the beginning, but to turn 5000 aswell.would really have liked to reccommend this. is odd how a game can be so close to perfection and yet so broken because of one thng."

At full price Civ 6 is no where near worth it and I can get bored of games quickly. You can still have fun, don't get me wrong (seeing as how I still managed to get 128 hrs). However, Firaxis is as greedy and inept as big studios come, charging a fraudulent $30 for DLC that does not contain anywhere near $30 of content. If you must buy this at full price really take a long think about it first. I would suggest getting the full Civ 5 bundle (all the DLC) when it's on sale for a few bucks, it's totally worth it.Summary: I do NOT recommend this game at full price. If the price comes down, yeah you can probably get plenty of hours out of it. Choice between 5 and 6? Get 5 bundle on sale.Good:-New concepts (districts)-Policy card system is not a new idea but the implementation of the separate culture tree is interesting-SMOOTH gameplay that is less buggy than Civ 5-Multiplayer works MUCH better than in 5-Graphics - if you like ths style.Bad:-Feels like a lot of content is missing (hello world congress?)-AI is still utter garbage (lazy devs not wanting to fix it)-Gameplay sometimes feels restrictive, feels like I have less options than in Civ 5 where there were more unusual but possible strategies-No proper modding tools for more specialized mods like Civ 5's IGE-Base UI is bad-Firaxis is slow and unresponsive to issues (as a full release title do not expect frequent patches or bug fixes)"
415,18.4,Recommended, February 4,2,"Contrary to what you might hear, this game is an improvement on Civ 5. The gameplay is more varied, there's more to do during a game, there are better incentives, more paths to take, more difficult choices and so on. I do believe it's genuinely more exciting than it was before. There is definitely a lot of work to be done, but as it stands, it's about on par with Civ 5 complete on the gameplay side of things.With Rise and Fall coming soon, and looking to be a huge step forward, with many gameplay complexities that layer nicely on top of what we already have, it should make for a much more advanced, yet enjoyable Civ.The problems I have with the game, are the frequent crashes and the poor performance. I run an Nvidia gtx 1080 and an AMD Ryzen 1700x and it struggles on max settings in the late game. It's a nice looking map, but reasonably low poly and the background processes should only benefit from an 8 core 3.4ghz processor. It dips to 40fps and you can see the game struggle as you pan across the map.More pressing are the crashes. Playing a single game on prince and standard speed with 6 AI, it has crashed 3 times already and I'm about 70% along the science tree. The crashes can happen at any time, for whatever reason. Just started a map? No problem, here's a crash. Released a nuke, certian that victory is yours? Nope, here's a crash. Funnily enough, the IOS version hasn't crashed on me once and development for that has been outsourced. Firaxis, up your game just a bit please.I feel like I have to address the AI, because it is the most talked about thing when it comes to this game. Yes, the AI is temperamental, yes they are hard to please, but no, they aren't (completely) broken. Having watched a fair bit of gameplay on Youtube to properly understand the game before I dived in, you can see the amount of hoop jumping you may have to do to please a neighbouring nation. The game is intricate and the rules of the game are hefty. You can't just throw money at an AI and think that's enough. You need to understand what they're after first, their leaders needs and how they function, where their placement is on the map, why they would need a certian luxury, what research they may or may not have, sending a scout to see their buildings, etc.Fair enough to that time where that AI was outrageously aggressive towards you, but an overhaul risks a complete dumb down of an intricate system that should be worth it in the end. If you can trust that Firxis will get this right eventually (and there is every chance they can, considering their track record of releasing bug ridden games that become masterpieces) then there is no need to panic, claim sacrilege, cry and everything else I've seen grown adults do over this game.I recommend this game now, if money doesn't mean much to you right now, you like 4X strategies and you don't mind some crashes and gameplay inaccuracies for the time being.Otherwise, wait until everyone changes their tone and for their sake, try to act surprised."

So far, the diplomacy and AI is the biggest improvement to me. Highly recomended, I predict I will log hundreds of hours."

I hope they'll realize quickly that Civ fans are far more discerning than the usual sports game crowd and stop trying to sap us for every penny they can. It's insulting. If I buy the season pass, I want Gods and Kings and Brave New World.If the game turns into a series of microtransactions, and I have to shell out hundreds of dollars for the game and all its DLC, I will abandon it in a heartbeat. Which will make me sad because it's easily my favorite game.July 21, 2017:I've given it the better part of a year now and still no sign of it getting better. There's still no World Congress. Which means the game still isn't even up to par with Civ 5. If it doesn't get it's act together, I'm poised to declare it the biggest let-down in gaming history. Worst disappointment for me so far.

Building an army or a simple spy takes ages, no matter how many production cogs you have. The progression feels like walking in a swamp, mostly at the game start and the late game.The addition of districts helps focusing cities in production, science, religion, culture, money or military, but feels unfinished and impractical. Adjacency bonuses are ridiculously low.The new fog-of-war system is annoying at best, and the required system specs to run the game is an insult. Come on! it's a turn based game! Somebody at the developement team didn't realize that yet.The only good thing I find about the game is the impossibility to have a wonder grabbing player, although benefits from each wonder are very reduced compared to previous iterations of the game.My overall opinion is that they could have invested the time and money making another Civ V extension instead this blushingly shameful ""Endless Legend"" copycat."

This game continues the trend of the popular Civilization series to coast on popularity and good looks, pouring a large budget into game assets while ignoring the AI. Despite its importance in a single player strategy game, the AI continues to get stupider with Civilization VI. Not only is the AI essentially broken, the game design is fundamentally flawed as it turns the playing experience into an exercise in micromanagement that is difficult to balance and is a nightmare to write AI for. This micromanagement serves to distract the player from the game's shortcomings: it is a single player strategy game with a hopelessly incompetent AI and poor game balance.

I was a little on edge about the graphics style, but it eventually grew on me. When I bought the game I started it up, then played about 20 minutes before getting bored. I would say this is because I have a short attention span for games like this, but this is not the case, as you can see I played around 115 Hours in Civ 5 and have played around 330 hours in HOI4 and around 400 In EU4. This game to me is just boring, it doesn't have the same smoothness and charm Civ 5 had in it's interface, and I quickly found out that diplomacy is useless. Civ 5 had a very simple diplomacy system, but at least it worked. The Devs pushed the ""Secret Agendas"" as neat things, and in theory they are, but in practice? Not so much. If you aren't fufiling a nation's secret agenda, they are never going to ally you, and they will most likely denounce you then go to war. The AI is very fickle so even if you make an ally, there's no telling how long it will last. Lastly, Trade deals will never go in your favor, so don't even bother. Other than that, the Districts mechanic is great, and can make more spread out cities, unlike the rather condensed feeling cities of Civ 5.Pros and ConsPros:-Districts are a nice edition-City State interactions work well-Religious victory has been reintroduced, and isn't overpowered like it was in Civ 4-Other More Minor ThingsCons-Diplomacy is for the most part useless-Gets boring (Might just be me, but It's worth noting.)-Continents can be weird (Especially when dealing with Britain)-Secret AgendasTLDR; I got bored of it, tried playing it again, was still bored.

Alliances as we knew them in previous Civ Rev games are gone. The diplomatic options in this game are difficult to understand or they simply do not work and the AI is way too unpredictable. The game is also boring! I loved the scenario game modes in past civ rev games (like WWII in Europe in Civ Rev 4) but the scenarios in this game are... non-existent? How long do we have to wait (and how much do we have to pay) before this game becomes good? It has been over a year!!Religion is a waste of time and space in the game. I have 4-6 missionaries surrounding my cities and it is extremely annoying.It is also incredibly frustrating to learn that they are making many fixes to the game but... it will cost $30. Why do this to loyal players like me? (I have bought the last 3 Civ Rev games upon their release) Do they not want us to buy the game until they offer DLC fixes?
34,155.7,Not Recommended," December 3, 2016",2,"All around ok game, But gunna give this thing a negative as the game specifically screws you out of building wonders. I noticed that every time I was 1 turn from completing a midevil or classic wonder, some other turd civ would just then complete it. It became a regular thing as I have played this game, so I decided to run an exeriment.For example. I selected the french to get the initial wonders build bonus. then I left and created games until I got an ideal location for lots of production and food. I ran this experiment 3 times to get my production as high as possible, while having enough food to grow quick. each time i got within 1 turn of finishing and the computer would beat me.Then i made a 1v1 map, and found the civ quick with the same set up. It didnt take long to find him building a district as I built the stonehenge wonder. somehow this turd, whom was not even building stonehenge, completed it the turn before I did yet again.I dont know if Sid does this to make the game harder or just to annoy its fans. Maybe there is a bet to see how much annoying crap they can put into the games before people quit.I for one have simple switch to the ""let the others build your wonders then murder those fools and take it"" approach. I suppose this is the more realistic method. Maybe that is the leason Sid is aiming for."

Initially, it seemed great and after waiting so long for an actual successor to Civ 5 I was delighted, however the longer you play the game the more and more obvious issues got.Big negatives for me are:- AI - every game seems to choose to annoy you rather than play tactically. every trade deal was only a deal to the other nation, you could never get a favourable deal, or even a like for like swap in most instances like in Civ 5. If you are doing better than another nation, they will denounce you. Everytime. Without fail. Not only that but nations will go way out of their way, nearly half the map in one instance, to settle a new land beside you to box you in. This, coupled with not being able to ask nations to not settle near you until after they already had, meant that to expand you had one choice. war. Which leads to the next problem...- War- this probably annoyed me most of all. There are now lots of different types of wars, each which add a little more diversity to how you conduct yourself around other nations. Surprise wars will gain you large warmongering penalties, but really these don't matter. If you have any warmongering penalty, everyone will treat you like an insane war lover. Even the nations that declared war on you and that you only fought back. If you are lucky enough to not have to fight them, rare but happened to me a few times, they will ask for peace, and throw resources and gold at you to accept. This happened to me quite alot, with nations going to war with me and after not even seeing one of their units, they would ask for peace and give me all their gold. While this was nice, it did end uip making the game very easy for a while, until everyone denounced me for warmongering.- Barbarians - unlike Civ 5, it appears raging barbarians (were barbarian units and camps will spawn alot quicker) is always on. ths means that early game, especially on larger maps, you have to spend alot more of your time, building up an army to tackle the problem, as they will not relent in attempting to attack your cities and units. also, they will be more technologically advanced than you. making it very annoying trying to combat a couple of freshly spawned barbarian units that are oikemen while you only have warriors. If this was intentional, then fair enough, however the large amount of troops you need has another consequence. Nations will fear you, and then denounce you. meaning that any attempt to brefriend them is gone before you even had a chance to make it work.Other than the above, I have had a few issues withcrashes changing civics policies later in the game, but I imagine these will be addressed sooner rather than later.Hopefully, after another patch or this will become the game it has the potential to be, but at the moment, that looks a long way off..."

Other Civs denounce you if: you build more wonders than them or build fewer, succeed against them in war or fail, have fewer spies than them or more, expand too much or too little. There seems to be no way to earn or keep allies in this game. Hopefully in expansions to this game, the programmers will realize that warmongering is not a zero sum game and focus more on the declaration of war vs. who actually wins that war as a penalty on the player."

The unstacking of the cities and the split of the science tree (incl. the Inspireation/Heureka moments) are great concepts that have increased the amount of decision making and thus the immersion into the game for me.On the downside I have to admit I do not find the AI overly challenging and plus the tech speed in relation to the production output requires IMHO a re-balance, but this is not impacting my fun with the game.Again really happy with the new Civ and looking forward now to the first patches and DLCs."
49,499.3,Recommended," October 20, 2017",2,One step forward two steps back. Graphics and new content are great. No Scrolling makes it harder to navigate the map. Does not tell where Barbarians are anymore and Barbarian Notification is iffy at best. Spies but nothing for them to do. Advisor will make you look bug eyed after a while. units that need assignments will really make you curse. Many times I was working on a war when a builder on the other side of the map got my attention. Funny thing is that the unit I had originally selected was still needing orders. Jumping from one unit to the next would be fine if first you would let me give the unit I have selected orders before you jump. Second Jumping real fast from one to another without giving me a chance to order one around is stupid.
121,6.9,Not Recommended, January 17,2,"I received a copy of version five for Christmas and have logged an insane number of very enjoyable hours playing it. When version six came out on humble bundle I couldn’t resist signing up for it. From the first time I loaded it I was unimpressed. The cartoon like animations were cute and the visuals are admittedly better the version five but there are some glaring problems and uncanny bugs that will have stopped me from even trying to go any further.1. First and foremost in my mind is the ridiculous user interface. The color combinations and text size seem to have been designed to make reading anything as difficult as possible. The box that pulls up when you click on a city or a character uses brown text on a brown background and green text on a green background as well as text that is so small that it requires me to put on my reading glasses and get right next to the screen. Compared to the crisp and legible interface on version five this is a huge disappointment.2. Along the same line both the character screen and the city screen switch sizes after a couple on moves and the bottom part is no longer visible on the screen. I thought it was an over scan problem with my monitor but it does the same thing in windowed mode so it’s a software bug.3. There is something very wrong with the AI running the barbarians, on my second try I had three horse mounted units show up and the stuck around for over thirty moves crippling any chance for a good start.4. The AI for the German group was allowed to spawn eight cities by move 100. He started on the far left on the map and spawned cities the minimum distance apart in a straight line towards my initial city.At this point I gave up, I was playing as Roosevelt with the difficulty set to prince."
90,86.4,Recommended," October 22, 2016",2,"I had many concerns about this game before release, starting with the change in art style, getting rid of global hapiness all the way through ridiculously low level of AI as seen on the pre-release streams. Most of these concerns were gone around one hour into the gameplay and I absolutely love it. It's a brand new take on civilization games and with each era progression I'm more amazed and curious how much more things did the developers add to the gameplay.Sure, AI feels a bit clunky and either is 'too aggresive' early on or very passive and just not up-to-date when it comes to maintaining a army. It's not THAT BAD though as I thought it'd be. Barbarians have been improved upon as they can be a real threat if you are not careful with your surroundings.There are many smaller bugs but it's something that can be easily fixed in a patch, if you played civ5 vanilla you should remember how bad it was. Civ6 is way better in that area, plus it has more content and features than civ5 with all DLCs which is a good sign.TL;DR:Overall: 9/10.+ No more tech beelining and doing tradition->rationalism in civics tree+ Nice split of science tech and cultural developments into separate trees+ Government system!+ Each game feels truly different because so much depends on the area you are in and the environment around you+ Loads of new and old-but-improved features that make the gameplay just awesome+ Playing wide is more than viable baby+ Super addictive (#OneMoreTurn)+ Pretty smooth UI+ Looks great (Getting used to the art style takes some minutes)+ Music, Sean Bean quotes and tons of other stuff- AI needs definitely some work- Lack of city rename feature :D- Less number of units in a unit upgrade line. Roman Legion -> Musketman, wtf?- Minimap looks terrible and is very hard to read. It's practically useless- Small UI and gameplay bugs that popup from time to time- Playing on a high end PC, time between turns can take quite a while on bigger maps."
16,603.1,Recommended," October 22, 2016",2,"Normally, I would wait to pen a review, but this game is simply that good. Virtually every system is improved on its own and now most are more interconnected than ever. Ever stage of the game feels like a competition - a very good thing. The two most impressive changes are to the cities and the tech trees: namely splitting them all up into more distinct parts. The tech tree has been streamlined by moving many important innovations into one culture-based civics tree, and the cities now have specielized districts which house most of the most important buildings. Gone are the days of almost entirely neglecting science or culture for the other.Gone, too, are the military slogs of Civ V. Now, the decision to get rid of Civ IV's ""stacks of doom"" in Civ V really makes sense. Instead, to ease congestion and add strategic and tactical depth, units can stack in various formations which become more useful as the game progresses. With this ability and a wider array of units overall, wars feel much more realistic. Unless your goal is to utterly crush an even matched foe 300-year-long wars are rare. The combat is entertaining in every era.If I had one criticism, it may be reserved for the victories, namely the Religious Victory. In the one game played to completion so far, Norway managed to sneak a religious victory past my American culture without even clearly meeting the express conditions because only one other civ of six even tried to hold out. Did Scythia have an extra city I didn't know about or is the majority status based on population? This I do not know and could not have known - very annoying when intentionally playing for a true late game victory. My new rule until a change is made is to immediately destroy any civ which overwhelms another civ's religion with its own. Otherwise, it's a great game which already has my vote for the best in the series.....And for those who complain about the art style - Why so serious? ;)"

41,50.4,Not Recommended," December 6, 2016",2,"This game is put together very well, has very few bugs, and has a nice appearance. It's an armchair game that you can play with just the mouse.After playing this game for awhile there really is very little challenge to the single player game because the computer opponents won't attack you unless you go out of your way to make them mad and if they do they don't use tactics and are easily defeated. It ends up just being an economic game (which is just clicking and clicking the mouse for hours on end. More importantly, and the biggest failure, (researching technologies is a big part of the game) and you really don't feel like your research decisions make a difference.Overall, it's plain to see that the optimization towards multiplayer and tablet play has sucked the life out of what could be an amazing game. Just too much clicking and not enough challenge due to a 'dumb' AI."
198,727.4,Not Recommended," February 9, 2017",2,"With most PC games pre-publication development is divided into an Alpha and a Beta stage. When it comes to the Civilization series, there is a third gestation period; the Gamma stage if you will. This covers the period between the official game launch and the inevitable release of the two expansions that will properly flesh out and re-balance a good game and make it great and add enough new content to come within a couple of miles of justifying the added cost.If you are a big fan of turned-based strategy games and money is no object or you like being in on this third larval stage, then Civilization VI is a smart purchase right now. Otherwise, exercise some restraint and wait for the total package. If you have and still enjoy any of the older Civilization titles, keep playing them. If you don't have them, buy now and discover the many pleasures of this wonderful series.In a year or so, Civ VI will be genuinely complete and available at a reasonable price and the Gamma version of Civ VII will be on the horizon."

I am old enough to have been playing Civilization since the first incarnation and can say that Civ VI is by far the worst. It is the only Civ game that I actively dislike. Many reviewers have gone into great detail on the issues with the game; I would agree with most of these negative reviews. The biggest problem is the completely schizophrenic AI. Other leaders love/hate you for indiscernable reasons and often in back-to-back turns. Defending yourself gets you labeled a warmonger. In general the diplomacy function is not ""deep"" but rather just random. Disappointing."

It`s missing something magical like Civ V had it. Of course its ""style"" has been updated quite well, but is this really the way to go? In my opinion not. But you have a couple of more opportunities than back in five. And you have the DLC section as well which is mostly disliked by the community of its game. So I would say this game is a step further than five but definitely needs to improve and I`m not sure if the price is worth it. If you`re not sure if you should buy this game, go ahead ask your friends what they like at this game and get some impressions by reviews and videos.For me this game is not worth paying the full price and especially not playing it for more than 100hrs. Go buy Civ V for a cheaper price and be happy :)."
30,98.9,Not Recommended," November 10, 2016",2,"This is a very disappointing game. It's a huge leap backwards from civilization 5, if you have and enjoy Civ 5 don't bother with this, if you don't have Civ 5 then get that instead.I'm just frustrated with the simple things that are missing or broken in this game.For a premium priced game, it just doesn't deliver. Lots of people will tell you things will be added and fixed and modded in time, and that may be so but for £50 i expected an improvement.There are some real game breaking bugs too, once you get the game to start (after figuring our which of the many ways it might fail to start affects you) you can be all the way to the late game before realizing a short war has left your cities crippled because war weariness doesn't go away when it should, it increases.

203,201.4,Not Recommended," October 24, 2016",9,"v.1.1Before we begin, I would like to make a note that this review is not a standing stone - it might change in both depth and final grade because of patches, updates, dlc, etc.I play this game since Civilization 1, and had certain expectations from this game, which unfortunately have not been met... yet. But this is a different story, because for now you want to know why this review goes against a mainstream - why cannot I recommend it?1. Unfinished / unpolished product. I was afraid of this most, ""for this has never happened before, and here we go again..."" The game is not only half-finished - in fact, it also misses some key and significant things which ALL previous civilizations had always been proud of, such as:- NO STEAMWORK- 0 scenarios (all previous games contained some scenarios in vanilla games),- 0 maps other than computer generated ones, it does not even have a simple Earth map to start with (even Civilization 1 had it).- can rename a religion - which is a bad thing in mp- though cannot rename your country or cities (which is very strange)- no auto work function for builders- no alert button for units- the game makes it clear from the start what future DLC will contain (which in my opinion is an insult to players considering the $ 80 price tag for vanilla game)Of course, many of those things will be fixed by modders sooner or later - but that would be a different game, why should Firaxis get a credit for the things they were lazy to implement on their own in vanilla game?2. AI. Lots of advertisements pointed out to the improved AI. I have not seen it, for I only see some scripted personalities which predictably react in certain way. In other words, there have been no significant improvement here:- AI still makes similar stupid mistakes as in Civilization 5 - for example, exploring with its own settlers, building cities in illogical places, having no tactics against a player other than sending waves of enemies until being defeated.- Adding to all that, AI does not know how upgrade its own troops, so you may end up in situations where you see chariots, archers, etc. accompanied by submarines... This might look funny but when it happens over and over the game not only loses immersion but also some logic.- Like in previous games, AI still spams player with useless offers, praises and denounces3. Multiplayer. I must admit that there is a big improvement here compared to civilization 5; however, it is far from being ideal. Desyncs, crashes happen very often, mp games are still very slow, especially at late game (wait times before player turns are unusually long). Also I do not understand why the game ""does not officially support"" more than 8 players in multiplayer (you need to manually unlock it) - even though we managed to play with 10 players, the fact that game says it is a bad sign as it only adds to what I said in point 1 about unfinished product.4. Although the district / Wonders placement is interesting in theory - it has many issues in practice which only make life harder for players (which is especially the case in mp). Thus, when the game starts, you can only guess which tiles might later be useful (where is oil, iron, etc.) - so you start building districts, Wonders, and then in late game you realize that (1) you have no room for new more districts or Wonders (if you play on small islands map, this is a big problem), (2) the above mentioned tiles contained some useful resources which now lost forever.- This would be not a big problem - (a) If the AI was in same circumstances - but unfortunately AI always know where to build due to scripts, (b) If the resources could be obtained by having Wonders on it, or (c) If the districts or Wonders could be transferred to other tiles. Now, keep in mind that you cannot remove your districts or Wonders, even if try to build it once but in few turns decide to build something else - you will be stuck with cosntruction on this tile forever.- Unfortunately, all this makes Wonders a bit useless, especially if you play an island game - where every tile might make a difference. So, I think the game will improve if players would be allowed to build Wonders in districts (for example, 1 Wonder per corresponding district) - this would greatly conserve the space on the map and simply make the map look better.- Another problem with Wonders is that sometimes they look weird - I understand some Wonders like Pyramids or Colossus must be built outside of the city but why cannot Eifel Tower, Big Ben, etc. be built in the City Centers, which is the case in real life? Also, why do they need to look bigger than an actual city on the map?There are also some bugs and mp glitches which I do not want to talk about for now - I will give developers an opportunity to fix them, for we know that they know about it - they did test a game after all, am I right?So, at its current stage the game deserves 6.0 out of 10."

And i have been playing since Civ 1. Ofcourse earlier Civs are seen in the context of the year they were made.Unhappiness is not a thing anymore. Cover the entire map with cities. No problem.Steamrolling the map is easy now. No more massive unhapiness penalties or need to create puppet states. You can just keep every single city you conquer. No penalties.Developing science and civics is incredible easy with the boost system. Also no penalties for number of cities.All in all you can have 100 cities and there is no penalties or difficulty of running such a huge empire.Information menus are gone or poorly made. List of military units? The list of your cities can't be sorted by production, science, or whatever. So when you hit 20+ cities get ready to micromanage for 10 minutes every turn. Also no more auto-production.Overall information on anything is bad or non existant.Districts are a gimmick. They dont make the game harder or immersive. They just make you trade off a resource tile to put buildings on. Improving and exploiting resources is still important. Builders (workers) that disapear after they have done their number of upgrades is dumb.Everything is streamlined, science, civics, city states, so there are no major trade-offs to consider anymore. Everything has their separate resource and function to make it easy (and boring). Government cards is the worse idea ever. Havent dozens of cards and being able to use 4 or 5...AI is the typical launch garbage. Diplomacy is bad as usual. Combat AI is terrible. AI civ management and victory pursuit is really bad.

69,121.5,Not Recommended," March 31, 2017",2,"As a fan of Civ V (2077 hours played), I was really looking forward to the release of Civ VI. Unfortunately I can't recommend this game in its current state.Firstly, this version should get credit for having many of the major game systems in the game upon release (trade, espionage and religion). Visually the game also looks quite good (although I would have prefered less cartoonish graphics, but that is just personal preference). The new district system also bring some interesting gameplay and I like that you can no longer have a single city that build all of the world wonders.The developers clearly had many good ideas, but some of them are poorly executed. The agenda system is one example of this. Meant to give each leader personality and flavor in diplomacy, it has not turned out well. One turn they will praise you, but just a few turns later they will hate you, even though nothing has changed. The religious victory is also quite mediocre. You just spam the same religious units over and over again. I don't find it to be much fun.My biggest issue is with the AI. As many others have pointed out, it is really bad. The AI does some really strange things, both in times of peace and during war. Here are some examples. Their units walks all over the place, for seemingly no good reason. They send unprotected settlers to the front lines during war. They build districts in odd locations and even though they build aeorodromes, I have never seen them use any planes. All in all the AI is great at making bad decisions. I'm also disappointed to see that difficulty levels still is all about how big of a head start the AI is given. I know this is the same as in Civ V, but i guess I had hoped for some sort of improvement, going from V to VI.Civ VI is also troubled with various UI that could have been more informative, some bugs and waiting time between turns can be very long.Lastly, I bought the game on release and I have waited until now to write a review, hoping that some of the major flaws would get fixed. I gave the game a new chance recently and unfortunately I can't see many improvements. I don't really see why I should play this version over Civ V. Actually I find Civ V to be more entertaining."

47,17.4,Not Recommended," October 23, 2016",2,"Okay, I get that they were trying to add a lot of new mechanics, but I think maybe they went overboard. Having to designate a specific tile for wonders and for districts while adhering to the myriad rules about which wonder/district can go where gets ridiculously difficult, especially if you also want to be able to feed and house your citizens when only certain kinds of tiles can be farms, etc. And it's many times worse if you're unlucky enough to be on a small island. Once you're well into the game and your cities stop gaining new tiles at any reasonable rate and are large enough that you can no longer purchase new tiles yourself, you're pretty much stuck as you can't do anything to remove districts/wonders if you discover later that you have a more pressing need for something else. Once not even focusing your city on food is enough, you may get into a situation where your city is shrinking and you can't build anything and even if you can research something that will give you more access to food, it may only be able to be built in a district you don't have and have no place to put. I'm finding it very frustrating even on settler level.

I gave it a year expecting bugfixes and while there has been some work put into fixing issues, a game that was a promising true sequel to Civ V is just not getting the support it requires to be a proper successor. Patches are not properly vetted and always introduce new issues. Do not buy Civ VI expecting proper post-launch support)AI spams users with war and/or peace offers every single turn (bug). Invisible rivers on Inland Sea map were never fixed. Barbarian scout notification warnings permanently appear on your own and random game units. Random unknown ""player defeated"" notifications spam you for the first third of a game, even when it's just a city-state being captured. The AI returning your own captured city when negotiating for peace results in your own city having a zero growth penalty, because for some reason it counts as a captured ""foreign"" city (bug). The game exe still randomly crashes for a large number of people when exiting. Default AI will give away all great works for a single luxury resource (Similar issue to the launch day balance issues, but this one is a straight up bug. All AI will trade away great works as if they have no value). These are all bugs that could've been fixed in one patch, however game updates have been minimal and will introduce new bugs as much as fix existing ones. Unlike with Civ V which enjoyed multi-page patch notes, in VI patches are focused on adding more DLC to buy.If at war the AI will move religious units into your military forces which auto-kills them for no reason. Even if you do not found ANY religion, third party AI will denounce and go to war with you because you were ""converting"" one of their cities. Logically this is impossible, but because killing the religious units incurs a penalty against that specific religion, all nearby uninvolved AI will pretend it was your nonexistent religion that was converting them.The AI is still relatively useless and poorly implemented. It will plant a city in the middle of four of your own despite a lack of resources, then take offense when you are forced to path units around it. You will receive a severe diplomatic penalty as a warmonger despite never starting a single war, which makes relations with other AI practically impossible if you are forced into playing defensive wars. AI will still not improve tiles with resources inside its borders, instead electing to trade more gold for them than it would to buy the workers outright to improve the tile next to its own capital.Despite the numerous upgrades in capabilities (such as unit stacking to build armies) Civ V's AI was more capable at warfare, both defense and on offense. Seige and artillery units will attempt to attack move even though its not allowed, so the AI just throws seige units at your combat troops. Even outside of war the AI will waste a hundred missionaries to convert a city that can only be converted by a prophet, which makes the AI useless at most religious victories.I could paste three more paragraphs of bugs from my previous review, but I am too lazy to verify which of those issues still exist. Maybe Civ VI will be in good shape in three years, or after the first two major expansion DLCs get released. Issues such as the great works trading make multiplayer pointless due to AI abuse, and the AI itself isn't programmed on how to defend itself even on Diety making single player equally frustrating. Give it a few more years or wait till it's 80% off, otherwise expect new bugs to be introduced with each quarterly patch."

Earth maps stimulate me!-the pacing REALLY needs to slow the ♥♥♥♥ down, I want to enjoy the renaissance and industrial age without going through it in 5 turns. Civ is to be savoured and the ages to be indicative of the period and not felt like it's gone in 60 sconds. By the time I have built a couple of improvments from the medeval era and settled across the map on the back of a donkey I have already found myself going into the industrial age and beyond. FGS let me FEEL the transitory vangelis conquest of paradise man! as like most of the previous games it feels brief and sometimes uneventful. As a player I really wanted to see more techs and eras everlasting, but as usual the tech tree seems to be getting shorter with every new game that gets knocked out!. NOW you've now got a 2 horse race going on, techs and cultural progression FLYING by and I am desperately trying to slow both of them down by NOT building science and cultural quarters.- the A.I. Really needs to improve and give me a game, become more competitve and develop some character (NO! ramping up the difficulty to emperor and beyond is NOT the solution as all that does is give it more resources and advantages and the ability to play faster but still acts like a buffed up superfast dumn♥♥♥♥♥br>-A.I building cities within 3 tiles of each other WHYWHYWHY WHY oh WHY does every civ game do this?? stop making the AI do this STAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP!...when is the AI ever going to stop this obsessive behaviour? it makes me want to overdoes on my selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors! it drives me crazy!-Eureka moments! I hate them! (MY personal opinion, I gather this replaces a golden age?) all eureka moments do is make the game go faster! NOOO! FFS I get a eureka moment for building a friggin wall? i'm sure I will get one for picking my nose, just tone this madness down ! I am eureking myself into an early grave FFS!- Also wish the game had events, phenomenons and disasters to keep your experience buzzing and occupied, maybe like a massive barabarian invasion (civ1 actually had this), revolutions which spread across the map, maybe have eureka momments that 'instead' kick starts a player onto some global military dominance and becomes a danger to the rest of the world? or earth quakes etc one game that kind of does this well for example is stellaris-why do the map sizes STILL make me feel crowded? I keep bumping into other civs within 5 turns!-Lastly I think this game is WAY too pricey! For the price on offer I would expect a civ game created on a massive proportion, something legendary! something to capture the imagination! everything that was great from the last five and MORE! but no... same old weak AI, same old dumbed down tech progression, everything flying past a 100mph :("

It ends up just being an economic game (which is just clicking and clicking the mouse for hours on end. More importantly, and the biggest failure, (researching technologies is a big part of the game) and you really don't feel like your research decisions make a difference.Overall, it's plain to see that the optimization towards multiplayer and tablet play has sucked the life out of what could be an amazing game.

This covers the period between the official game launch and the inevitable release of the two expansions that will properly flesh out and re-balance a good game and make it great and add enough new content to come within a couple of miles of justifying the added cost.If you are a big fan of turned-based strategy games and money is no object or you like being in on this third larval stage, then Civilization VI is a smart purchase right now. Otherwise, exercise some restraint and wait for the total package. If you have and still enjoy any of the older Civilization titles, keep playing them. If you don't have them, buy now and discover the many pleasures of this wonderful series.In a year or so, Civ VI will be genuinely complete and available at a reasonable price and the Gamma version of Civ VII will be on the horizon."

I am old enough to have been playing Civilization since the first incarnation and can say that Civ VI is by far the worst. It is the only Civ game that I actively dislike. Many reviewers have gone into great detail on the issues with the game; I would agree with most of these negative reviews. The biggest problem is the completely schizophrenic AI. Other leaders love/hate you for indiscernable reasons and often in back-to-back turns. Defending yourself gets you labeled a warmonger. In general the diplomacy function is not ""deep"" but rather just random. Disappointing."

It`s missing something magical like Civ V had it. Of course its ""style"" has been updated quite well, but is this really the way to go? In my opinion not. But you have a couple of more opportunities than back in five. And you have the DLC section as well which is mostly disliked by the community of its game. So I would say this game is a step further than five but definitely needs to improve and I`m not sure if the price is worth it. If you`re not sure if you should buy this game, go ahead ask your friends what they like at this game and get some impressions by reviews and videos.For me this game is not worth paying the full price and especially not playing it for more than 100hrs.

15,11.6,Not Recommended," November 28, 2017",9,"Short note, I will make this review as detailed as I can, but since I got bored very quickly, I can't go too in depth.Overall Experience: I came into this super exited with all the new features it was going to have, I liked the new District system, and I was looking forward to it. I was a little on edge about the graphics style, but it eventually grew on me. When I bought the game I started it up, then played about 20 minutes before getting bored. I would say this is because I have a short attention span for games like this, but this is not the case, as you can see I played around 115 Hours in Civ 5 and have played around 330 hours in HOI4 and around 400 In EU4. This game to me is just boring, it doesn't have the same smoothness and charm Civ 5 had in it's interface, and I quickly found out that diplomacy is useless. Civ 5 had a very simple diplomacy system, but at least it worked. The Devs pushed the ""Secret Agendas"" as neat things, and in theory they are, but in practice? Not so much. If you aren't fufiling a nation's secret agenda, they are never going to ally you, and they will most likely denounce you then go to war. The AI is very fickle so even if you make an ally, there's no telling how long it will last. Lastly, Trade deals will never go in your favor, so don't even bother. Other than that, the Districts mechanic is great, and can make more spread out cities, unlike the rather condensed feeling cities of Civ 5.Pros and ConsPros:-Districts are a nice edition-City State interactions work well-Religious victory has been reintroduced, and isn't overpowered like it was in Civ 4-Other More Minor ThingsCons-Diplomacy is for the most part useless-Gets boring (Might just be me, but It's worth noting.)-Continents can be weird (Especially when dealing with Britain)-Secret AgendasTLDR; I got bored of it, tried playing it again, was still bored.

74,210.4,Recommended," October 22, 2016",2,"It's got a great early to mid game. You actually have much more leeway to decide how to build a civilization.Examples: You don't really need to get useless technologies like previous games. I didn't learn how to build the most basic boats until the industrial era, just because the techs I actually need weren't entirely dependent on previous techs in the tree. Like you can get several science techs before getting any military or economic techs.Districts also help a lot. You can't build every district early because there are population limits to how many you can build, but where you build them first also really matters. Like if I care about science I'll put my science district near my capital, but also with a few flat tiles nearby to put universities or wonders on, since they all require their own tiles. Later I'll make an economic district, but I won't have a place to build a couple buildings so I will never be making as much money as I would if I built it first.Also, the government is more complex. You can build different into 10 different governments, each with there own advantages and policies that all have a serious impact on how you do things.Lastly, the city states are cooler. The straight benefits are greater, and no real 'random benefits', which was a major reason to use them in the last game. In particular, if you're an ally of a city state you can pay them a reasonable fee to take control of their entire army for 15 turns, which is huge as they usually have about 5 units. So if you have one nearby, you don't have to worry about suprise attacks as much since you can have a decent army at your disposal within the turn.Those changes make a major impact early to mid game, but if you get to the final stages they tend to matter less overall.My biggest gripe, by far, is that the AI is idiotic. It tends to be annoying with stupid demands, they may constantly declare war on you, but they tend to be terrible at actually waging war. They may ask to trade my 'open borders and luxery resource' for 3 gold total, but then i'll ask to make it even, and they'll demand all my luxery resources, open borders, and 180 gold. But not offer anything. Like they'll interupt my playing to send me that stupid a trade."
41,272.1,Not Recommended," July 9, 2017",2,"Imagine playing a game of chess on the computer and every time you up the difficulty, the computer gets an extra rook or even an extra queen. Suddenly all it needs to do to get a pawn promotion is to get to the middle of the board instead of the end. That's what playing Civ VI is like. That's ultimately why I can't just blindly recommend this game.There is a LOT I really enjoy about this game especially compared to Civ V. I really like that physical space matters when building districts and composing your city. That you can't just build any and every wonder because you need not only space fo wonders, but the appropriate land types and location. I love that you can stack units, link units, and even name them at some point to better keep track of them. I like that city-states give unique bonuses if you're suzerain of them and they actually can make a difference. City-states will actually go after barbarians, attack you if you're at war or help you if they are on your side.I've never felt like I was ""doing the same old thing"" each game I played. Focusing on science feels different than focusing on production and that feels different than focusing on culture. There is strategy in building up your cities and deciding on districts. That's fun. I like that.The huge issue I have which completely ruins the fun for me is how the difficulty level works. Instead of playing smarter with maybe giving itself a few advantages, rules just stop applying to them. Or I should say, it becomes even more obvious how the rules don't apply to them. They don't need to research, they don't need production or science, they just ""get"" things. And when you up the difficulty they just get them ""faster"" and at a rate that you yourself definitely cannot do. Which then makes the game more of a gamble in that you better hope for a starting position where you have the right resources close enough and no way of having four barbarian encampments surrounding you or you can just assume that you've lost the game.What ends up happening is then when you lose a game, you can't stop and think about ""What could I have done better?"" because it doesn't matter. If you lose a game of chess, you can think about your mistakes, where you were surprised, and what your opponent was doing and improve your own strategy. In this game, you can't do that. Because the computer isn't playing the game. . .it's only creating an environment that you exist in.Yes, Civ isn't chess. But you have to recognize that playing a game where you have to strategize in order to beat your opponents who are playing the same game as you is completely different than playing a game where it's just you in an increasingly difficult puzzle with everything stacked up against you."
637,100.8,Not Recommended, March 10,2,"Doesn't substantially improve on Civ V, and feels less polished and less user-friendly than its predecessor.The lack of automation features, opaque diplomatic interface (and insane AI), and generally magnified amount of micromanagement and busywork are the reason I'm giving this installment a thumbs down. The religion system is clunky and adds to the intense micromanagement. If missionaries, workers, scouts, etc. could be automated (as they were in previous editions...) then this wouldn't be so bad. The music and sound are boring at best and annoying at worst. There are severe balance issues between the different victory types and civilizations, with some being barely viable at all on higher difficulties.It's not all bad, though. The new Civic tree is an excellent addition and I hope it returns for future installments, and the way great people work is a welcome change as well. The civs all feel different (not all of them are interesting or balanced, but they're all unique.) The barbarians have teeth this time around and feel like a genuine part of the game instead of a stepping stone. The new fog-of-war map looks great.I'm neutral on the district system. I don't really like it, but I don't hate it, either. It's new and different, and it was worth trying. I do like that wonders take up hexes the same way a district would. It heavily incentivizes rapid expansion - which is fine, because there is literally no reason not to expand as fast as possible with the new happiness / amenities system. Sure, there are diplomatic penalties, but the crazy AI will do whatever it wants regardless of your expansion penalties.Avoid at full price. Worth picking up on sale for fans of the series just to see all the ways things can go wrong while a few other things go right."

Civ 5 had a very simple diplomacy system, but at least it worked. The Devs pushed the ""Secret Agendas"" as neat things, and in theory they are, but in practice? Not so much. If you aren't fufiling a nation's secret agenda, they are never going to ally you, and they will most likely denounce you then go to war. The AI is very fickle so even if you make an ally, there's no telling how long it will last. Lastly, Trade deals will never go in your favor, so don't even bother. Other than that, the Districts mechanic is great, and can make more spread out cities, unlike the rather condensed feeling cities of Civ 5.Pros and ConsPros:-Districts are a nice edition-City State interactions work well-Religious victory has been reintroduced, and isn't overpowered like it was in Civ 4-Other More Minor ThingsCons-Diplomacy is for the most part useless-Gets boring (Might just be me, but It's worth noting.)-Continents can be weird (Especially when dealing with Britain)-Secret AgendasTLDR; I got bored of it, tried playing it again, was still bored. Diplomacy is useless"

If you wish to get a game better than civ 5, wait for the final edition, or, u can just grab it now, its your wallet :p"
8,648.4,Recommended, February 25,2,"I've played Civilization since the original back in the day... and each iteration has something new to offer. Civiziation VI: Rise and Fall is outstanding! It provides much more depth than the base Civ VI and adds to the ""every game is different"" style of play. This game provides several different strategies to try and due the custimization options setting up your game, there is an almost unlimited style to play each new game.I recommend this game to everyone."

The unstacking of the cities and the split of the science tree (incl. the Inspireation/Heureka moments) are great concepts that have increased the amount of decision making and thus the immersion into the game for me.On the downside I have to admit I do not find the AI overly challenging and plus the tech speed in relation to the production output requires IMHO a re-balance, but this is not impacting my fun with the game.Again really happy with the new Civ and looking forward now to the first patches and DLCs."
121,6.9,Not Recommended, January 17,2,"I received a copy of version five for Christmas and have logged an insane number of very enjoyable hours playing it. When version six came out on humble bundle I couldn’t resist signing up for it. From the first time I loaded it I was unimpressed. The cartoon like animations were cute and the visuals are admittedly better the version five but there are some glaring problems and uncanny bugs that will have stopped me from even trying to go any further.1. First and foremost in my mind is the ridiculous user interface. The color combinations and text size seem to have been designed to make reading anything as difficult as possible. The box that pulls up when you click on a city or a character uses brown text on a brown background and green text on a green background as well as text that is so small that it requires me to put on my reading glasses and get right next to the screen. Compared to the crisp and legible interface on version five this is a huge disappointment.2. Along the same line both the character screen and the city screen switch sizes after a couple on moves and the bottom part is no longer visible on the screen. I thought it was an over scan problem with my monitor but it does the same thing in windowed mode so it’s a software bug.3. There is something very wrong with the AI running the barbarians, on my second try I had three horse mounted units show up and the stuck around for over thirty moves crippling any chance for a good start.4. The AI for the German group was allowed to spawn eight cities by move 100. He started on the far left on the map and spawned cities the minimum distance apart in a straight line towards my initial city.At this point I gave up, I was playing as Roosevelt with the difficulty set to prince."
27,91.1,Recommended," October 22, 2016",2,"Overal i think it is best and most engaging civ i have played (i played Civ since Civ1, but have not played Civ5 much).Pros:- Runs smooth on average specs- Districts and wonders add whole new dimension to city planning and city placement.- Tech boosts and division of techs to 2 separate trees add some interesting considerations too.- Non-infinite workers remove ""railroads everywhere"" thingie that started back at Civ 1. Also turns are now much shorter because of this.- I like how great people are acquired in this iteration and how they are unique.- Barbarians are bigger threat and not just little nuisance- City states are much more intuitive and logical.Cons:- AI at prince is as stupid as usual. I don't like having to enable cheats (harder difficulties) for computer to help him alleviate this stupidness.- City UI is bad and by default show literally nothing.- Important information (like adjustment bonuses) that is present in building tooltips when you research this buildings is missing from tooltip when you want to build this buildings. And no tooltips about what building does at all if it is already built.- Civilopedia is either not intuitive or don't have some important gameplay information (I.e. not all civilization bonuses listed)- Generally tile yields should overlay resource icon and not vice versa - currently it is too tricky to see yields (press this button, press that button, zoom in).Gameplay wise i feel like i'm playing refined and finally well-though implementation of old features with most interesting (at least for me) addition at all history of series (districts).Only complaints are about UI (but i don't play UI, i play gameplay and math) and AI (it was always stupid in Civilization, so nothing new and unexpected here)"
221,318.0,Recommended," October 22, 2016",2,"This is, in my opinion, a fantastic game and a definite improvement on Civilization V. The graphics are an enourmous improvement, as can be expected. The art style is highly debatable but I'm personally a fan of it. The district system works well and isn't hard to learn, and the victory types are an improvement from Civilization V - the religious victory in particular is a nice touch.The civic system is also very good, although I can see the system having one or two perfect routes in the future. I'm also a fan of the civilizations themselves, but I would like more of them in the future.There are a few problems though. The AI isn't perfect - they don't always make use of the escort system very well when it comes to Builders and Settlers and Barbarians are very strong early game; I've considered turning them off more than once. Diplomacy still needs a little work, and the envoy system took more than a few glances at to understand.As someone whose used the Enhanced UI mod for Civilization V, I also found the UI a little difficult to understand for the first few hour, but I've gotten used to it by now.T̶h̶e̶r̶e̶ ̶i̶s̶ ̶a̶l̶s̶o̶ ̶a̶ ̶r̶a̶t̶h̶e̶r̶ ̶s̶t̶r̶a̶n̶g̶e̶ ̶b̶u̶g̶ ̶w̶h̶e̶r̶e̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶g̶a̶m̶e̶ ̶r̶a̶n̶d̶o̶m̶l̶y̶ ̶h̶a̶n̶g̶s̶ ̶o̶n̶ ̶e̶x̶i̶t̶ ̶a̶n̶d̶ ̶r̶e̶f̶u̶s̶e̶s̶ ̶t̶o̶ ̶c̶l̶o̶s̶e̶,̶ ̶c̶r̶e̶a̶t̶i̶n̶g̶ ̶i̶s̶s̶u̶e̶s̶.̶ ̶M̶o̶r̶e̶ ̶t̶h̶a̶n̶ ̶o̶n̶c̶e̶ ̶I̶'̶v̶e̶ ̶h̶a̶d̶ ̶t̶o̶ ̶u̶s̶e̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶R̶e̶s̶t̶a̶r̶t̶-̶>̶C̶T̶R̶L̶+̶A̶L̶T̶+̶D̶e̶l̶e̶t̶e̶-̶>̶L̶o̶c̶k̶ ̶t̶r̶i̶c̶k̶ ̶t̶o̶ ̶g̶e̶t̶ ̶i̶t̶ ̶t̶o̶ ̶c̶l̶o̶s̶e̶.̶ ̶D̶o̶e̶s̶n̶'̶t̶ ̶e̶f̶f̶e̶c̶t̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶g̶a̶m̶e̶p̶l̶a̶y̶ ̶b̶u̶t̶ ̶i̶t̶ ̶i̶s̶ ̶i̶r̶r̶i̶t̶a̶t̶i̶n̶g̶ ̶-̶ ̶N̶e̶v̶e̶r̶ ̶e̶v̶e̶r̶ ̶E̶x̶i̶t̶ ̶T̶o̶ ̶D̶e̶s̶k̶t̶o̶p̶ ̶w̶h̶i̶l̶s̶t̶ ̶i̶n̶-̶g̶a̶m̶e̶.̶ ̶ -> This bug appears to have been patched out; I haven't had it in months.However, for me, personally, these problems were more things I noticed and made note of than problems that ruined or negatively effected my gameplay (except perhaps the Barbarians - it was a shock initally). For others, these issues might be more irritating so, despite the fact I'm enjoying Civilization VI immensely, they are worth noting.I also know people who dislike the artstyle. As I've stated earlier, I'm personally a fan of it. The music is pretty cool too.Overall, Civilization VI is a game that, as of my first impressions, I recommend both as an improvement to Civilization V and as a game in its own right. I wouldn't say that it was a monumental improvement over Civ V Brave New World, but it certaintly is comparatively to Vanilla Civ V, and of course through expansions it has the potential to be even better."
412,25.1,Recommended," October 31, 2016",2,"Civ is a series that's long in the tooth and short in titles worth playing for many hours. Five games in a row where all civilizations play more or less the same, and everyone needs to go for conquest victory. As someone who's played every single Civ game (yes, even the one where you had to select which audio/video drivers you wanted to use every time you booted it), I'm pretty used to how it works. I expected a game or two of conquest, then maybe a half-hearted try at science or religious victory, before ""getting"" the game's mechanics and feeling like i'd already experienced everything it had to offer.But while I truly expected that, I bought the game so close to release because it promised to be more. Specifically, it promised to be a realization of what civ5 was trying, and failing, to do.Civ5 shook things up in a lot of ways. Hex grids, forbidding unit stacking, etc. But it landed awkwardly, and didn't fuse the new elements together well. Plus, it forsook a lot of good features from the past (religions, anyone?). Civ6, as the direct successor, did what 5 wanted to do - and more. It polished the awkward innovations, brought back the old features that were sorely missing, and wrapping it all up with the best execution of any civ game yet.Look, I could go into the specifics of these things, like unit ""corps"" instead of stacks, the viability of different victory conditions, an actual espionage system, a much-improved diplomacy experience, the absolutely brilliant way that civics are separated from technology, and the game-changing nature of ""boosts"" in research based on things you do in the actual game itself. I could laundry-list all the good things - but I don't think I need to. The gameplay is the most polished of any Civ since the first one.But I'll just pick one important thing that all these changes make: Not everyone plots the exact same course to victory. Given how boosts work, and the bifurcaton of civics/technologies, your actual plan and experience is different based on who you're playing and what the map looks like.Civ6 is a great game that doesn't need expansion packs to become that way. It didn't ship prematurely, and its core gameplay is much more engaging than any other in the series."

755,34.6,Not Recommended," October 31, 2016",2,"I cannot recommend this game at this time. it feels like a polished Early-Access game instead of a full release, which is all the more a shame considering who it is coming from.The bones of a fantastic game are there, and I have no reason to believe that Fraxis won't flesh them out in the months to come. The unstacking of cities, combining military units together, researching civics like techs, boosting techs and civics. There is a lot to like here in what they have changed. Hell, you can build more than 4 cities with no noticiable penalty, which really is nice if you want to make a huge civilization.However, there are problems. Other reviewers do a great job but I just want to echo ones that stand out to me as the worst. Bugs and the AI.For a complete game, the amount of technical issues is sad. None are game breaking, but I would expect better. Sure, in two months they will probably be fixed, but I am pretty sick of how many games are being released in this sad state. The audio for the people talking in the intro video and all in game voices are too quiet and impossible to hear. I didn't even know Sean Bean was involved because he was impossible to hear, until randomly the victory screen you can hear him fine. I put a support ticket into 2k one the day the game was released and they only wrote me back today, although none of their suggestions fixed the issue. The game also randomly hangs when I go to exit it and annoying other things. Again, this will probably all be fixed, but pretty sad for basic things like this to be messed up.The AI is also awful. Sure, Civ games are way more complex then just about any other game and I cannot imagine the nightmare of making a compotent AI oppent, but the AI in Civ 6 is laughably bad. Worse than Civ 5. I would hope asking for AI that is at least as much of a challenge as it was in Civ 5 would be the base line. Instead, diplomacy is all over the place and the AI has yet to take a single city from me, even when I purposely left one undefended with no walls to see if they would take it while we were at war and they had units next to the city. Instead, the units danced around. Hell, they barely even pillaged. This problem goes away in MP, but I primarily play Civ against the AI, so this is a sad development.TL;DR: Great potential of a game with too many issues in its current state to recommend, but will probably be fixed in the future."
72,13.7,Not Recommended," November 2, 2016",2,"This game showed so much promise but ultimately I really regret paying for this. The AI is completely and utterly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, the ""diplomacy"" could be replaced by a visual display of rolling dice which would dictate what the AI players do that round.There's absolutely no causality between your actions and the reactions from the AI. The one neighbor that has continuously denounced you since the first century of the game might never declare a war on you no matter what you do. Another one, with whom you've been friends since the beginning might suddenly declare a war while declaration of friendship is still active, then after 10 or so rounds, come back with a peace offer backed by a substantial gift. After accepting they're your friend again and offer a declaration of friendship if it happened to expire during the war.A random AI player might offer you a trade where you give them a solid lump of money, another sum each year for many rounds and even throw in a handful of various luxury resources. Oh yeah, and you get nothing in return. But trade's a trade, right?And of course AI loves to build new cities right against your borders, then complain about your military near their border. Eventually they'll declare a war and utterly crush your puny army of tanks and artillery with their indomitable war machine of two spearmans and a crossbowman.More major annoyances and countless of minor ones, but the AI issues are so gigantic that I can't even.tl;drIf you like Civilization, don't buy this. They might eventually fix it but for the love of gaming, don't let them get away with releasing crap like this."

I'm only made aware of the issue after the purchase. Quite frankly I feel like I got scammed.The game itself is also full of inconveniences. Mouse scrolling doesn't always work is the one that really got my nerves. AI is still bad. Not really a fan of the new artwork either. You'll have a difficult time differentiating between unxplored territory and fog of war because they are all in the same color. Some features are indeed interesting, such as districts, but if you are trying to decide whether to buy Civilization V or VI, I definitely suggest you to stick with the former.Overall, I honestly don't feel like I got my money's worth"

36,707.5,Not Recommended," January 2, 2017",2,"Personally, I've enjoyed this latest addition to the Civilization series, the focus on each civ's abilities and unique bonuses give the game a greater variety and emphasis on which civ the player chooses. At the same time, the bonuses of each civ are spread out so a certain civ isn't limited to a single victory type. Compared to previous civ games, the biggest changes are in the districts/wonders and diplomacy. I like the new requirements for wonders and the fact that they take a tile, as it prevents one civ from building all the wonders in a single city, although sometimes the requirements might be a little too picky (ie The Great Zimbabwe needing to be adjacent to a cattle resource and commercial hub) and often prevent wonders from being built until much later in the game. In terms of the diplomatic game changes, I'm surprised and slightly disappointed by the removal of diplomatic victory and world congress. I enjoyed the world congress in civ 5 and it needed some work, but it definately added to the gameplay. I enjoy the new casus belli system, and I think it could be developed further to add more reasons. An additional casus belli for claimed land and forward settling (if a couple requests to stop settling near a player in the future are ignored/denied or a promise is broken, a small casus belli could be added for any cities within 6 tiles of one your own cities) could be added to deter overly expansive ai/players.Biggest Complaints:The art style of the civs is chaotic ranging from decent to garbage- leaders such as gandhi recieved rediculous cartooned features, while victoria recieves atleast a somewhat realistic image, but still cartoon. I'd prefer a return to the attempts at realism in civ 4.Diplomatic relations are next to impossible, to be friendly with a civ, you must appeal to both of their agendas and even then any little thing can set them off, and a friendship doesn't really grant you anything-in civ 5 your friends might denounce those you denounce or even declare war with you, not so in civ 6, everyone denounces eachother and declare meaningless wars.Civ 6 is a decent game, but its not worth $50+, the price needs to be atleast halved to be worth it."
420,47.9,Recommended," October 26, 2016",2,"A great installment into the Civilization series Civ6 changes a few things up in a major way. With a full game and a half under my belt in 22 hours I'm definitely enjoying the game. However, nothing is without some flaws, so while I wholeheartedly recommend getting Civ6, these are the things that bother me, and may bother you.Movement:The change to movement that requires your unit to have enough MV to move into a hex is definitely a huge impact to combat and moving around in general. In case you are unaware of the change, now a unit needs to actually have the 2mv points in order to move into a hill or forest area, as opposed to in Civ5 where you only needed 'some' amount of mv points, and if you didn't have enough to move into the hex it would bring you to 0 and stop your unit from going forward.The reason this hurts is because it costs you extra turns to just move units around. For example getting to a river with 1 of 2 mv points you have to end your turn get the 2mv points, cross the river (which takes 2mv points) and then end your turn in order to continue forward. Previously you would have gotten to the river with 1mv point, crossed it which brings you to 0 and end your turn. On the next turn you'd have 2mv points and continue your march into the distance.I was hoping that the new system would make for slightly smarter / better AI now that they had agendas. But that still didn't stop my strongest friend (Japan) from surprise war declaring on me, even though I had a very strong military, and 2nd highest religion (behind him) and culture (behind Russia) which are all part of his Bushido agenda, and was very financially stable which was his secret agenda (Money Grubber). This was after he pulled me into a war with Russia, who he then made peace with 10-15 turns later, and left me alone to fight them for around 50+. (Still not sure how that happened, Russia just would NOT let me negotiate peace with them)The few other things, that have been awkward getting used to is amenities, and how unclear it is at first glance why / how to increase them (until you get the recreation district). The Barbarian raiding parties when you fail to catch a scout before it gets back to it's base. One of my playthroughs almost ended short because I had three raids hit my capital at once.Again, I still totally recommend the game, and plan on dumping many more hours into it, but it definitely isn't a ""perfect"" game either... but anyone expecting that is foolish to start with."

224,27.0,Not Recommended, March 11,2,"I've been playing Civilization since the beginning and can honestly say this is the most disappointing version yet. Even on sale I feel like I wasted my money.Pros:1) National Parks2) The eureka system3) Traders creating roads as they go4) Maybe the corp/army/fleet...Cons:1) The balance between the player and the AI is completely broken. I checked and even at chieftain difficulty the AI is ridiculously over powered. This isn't Dark Souls!!2) The UI is complicated and hard to navigate.3) Production queues - where are they? Having to micromanage because it seems to be a glorified tablet game is beyond annoying.4) The AI constantly issues denouncement proclamations that you are unable to skip.5) The limit on the amount of times a builder can be used is far too small compared to the financial or production cost of creating one. Along with the inability for them to simply lay down road improvements between cities and in an automated manner.6) I can see the districts show some signs that they had potential to work, but essentially the implementation is flawed to the point of being unable to genuinely have the sense you are advancing your civilization. The initial first stage ancient era buildings should not require their specific districts to be present before they can be constructed. It is extremely frustrating to be waiting for the population to increase another few levels when in the industrial age so that you are allowed to build a library because you urgently needed to build a military district and cultural districts first.7) Lack of ability to rush a construction when not all items can be directly purchased does not work. One or the other being removed is fine, but not being able to do either results in a painful slow death if you were not able to start the game with an effective early land grab (especially combined with the districts issue).8) The various civilizations are not equally balanced against each other, instead a few are distinctly OP compared with the rest.9) Espionage technology theft should just obtain the whole technology if it is the immediately next one above the player's current level. Having to wait 12 turns to complete only half the research after waiting for the spy to deploy in the target city is just too long a wait for not enough return. At that stage of the game the chances are the player has a massive amount of science anyway or at the other end of the spectrum is hopelessly being crushed by the sh%tty AI bias that it just doesn't really work.10..) There's honestly more but at this point it seems like kicking a dead horse....Honestly what I would love to see the developers do is produce a new version of Civilization that feels like it is a worthy sequel, not just a more flawed version of the last game.Instead of having the game finish on Earth in 2050, how about instead adding in a new level of gameplay involving expansion onto the Moon, Mars and into the solar system using additional ""regions"". Not doing another clone of the same game set on another world as they have in 'Alpha Centauri'/'Beyond Earth', but actually adding to the existing gameplay."

I write few reviews. I figure that i have better things to do than complain. In this case I am making the effort because I don't want ANYONE that has bought Civ prior to this to get stuck with such an awful game. I understand the need to make changes in such a long running series. My personal feeling is that you shouldn't change more than 20% from version to version. This is a total departure from Civ 5. Even worse it just doesn't work. It is such a disappointment that I won't buy another Sid Meier game with anything but a spotless review.

AI is moronic, denounces for no reason, goes to war but rarely attacks, etc.Glad I got it as a gift because I would not pay money for this game right now."
38,165.1,Not Recommended," January 23, 2017",2,"Unfortunately in this games current state, this game would not be something that I would be willing to recommend.Firstly, the games performance is fantastic, coming from early Civ V's consistent crashing and disconnecting in multiplayer, you will find Civ VI's loading screens and multiplayer performance a pleasant surprise after coming from Civ V. I have experienced absolutely no issues while playing this game.I feel that this game visually appears a bit crowded and difficult to decipher, the colours aren't very distinct from each other in some environments and when zoomed out the map kind of appears just like a big blob of very dull colours, when in environments like the desert however the game feels bright and visually appealing.There is something about it that I can't quite place my finger on, but with the current look of the game I struggle to get the same immersive feel that I can get in Civ V, possibly as a result of the new cartoonish art style that takes the game away from feeling like you're controlling an expansive empire and closer to the experience of a casual mobile game.Similar to a casual mobile game, the DLC are uninspiring, boring and honestly a complete waste of money. A single civilization and 'scenario' are hardly worth the $5 USD, especially if you intend on just having the DLC civilizations as an AI nation in your single player games.The AI are awful. There is simply no other way to put it. Diplomacy feels completely void of any real effect to the game, upon meeting an AI it is not whether they will be a vital ally or mortal enemy, but rather how long until you inevitably anger them to the point where they will hate you for the rest of the game? I have failed to have at least one successful alliance with any AIs in the game. Inviting their delegations appears to have no effect, and if it does, I would not know what it is, a feeling you will commonly have in this game where tool tips are either unhelpful or non-existant. Casus Belli system while welcome seems useless because worrying about your warmonger status is pointless due to the fact that everyone already hates you.In addition to the terrible diplomacy regarding other AI nations, the city-state system, while I actually appreciate the envoys that have been added to the game, losing the ability to pledge protection to a city state, be called into their wars and gift units to a city state makes it utterly useless to have any real alliance with them as you would be able to acheive in Civ V. You will now find yourself making the decision of declaring a war upon the AI invading the city-state itself and having a full scale war, or allowing them to destroy your faithful city-state ally, losing the ability to fight a form of proxy-war where you are providing units but not formally at war again allows Firaxis to continue to completely destroy any immersive feeling that may have existed in Civ VI.The UI is minimalist, and disappointing, things such as your GPT and science per turn are now presented as tiny little numbers in the top left corner. While this in itself is a bit annoying, as it really doesn't draw your attention like the previous Civ V top bar did, the real thing that disappoints me is the fact that when you are in negative GPT, it doesn't even change colour or warn you. You now have to keep up with the job of pulling out your magnifying glass every turn to see whether or not you are even making money. A similar experience with the new minimalist notifications, which again are completely unable to grab your attention with the crowded visuals of the game and you will frequently miss events.I thoroughly enjoy the new districts, religion and wonder changes, seeing your wonders stand tall next to your cities is fantastic and a great addition to the game, religion is similar to Civ V and works like a treat, the only fault that I would give it is the waves of missionaries that infect your land as you get further in the game as well as the poor AI 'agendas' which will leave you as an enemy forever despite any other diplomatic events that had occured if you do not match another nations religion.Overall, the words that I would use to describe this game is; disappointing and boring."
40,66.2,Not Recommended," August 29, 2017",2,"Sit comfy, i’m going to tell you a story.A story about me. A story from a simple worker. First, let me explain something. My life began in 250 Anno Domini, and yes, began is the right word. Taking aside the scientifical explanation ( and plethora of methaphysical contemplation of my own ) would be suitable for now, as I – Perun Of Kraków came to life on a very odd land. It always seemed eerie to me that people here can walk only in 6 directions, even when reminded that world exists as an unlimited space in which particles should be able to travel in any direction possible. Still, the people did not understand that. My only purpose seemed to be a worker and any sort of conversation with authorities seemed pointless, as proved in any occasion.The story begins in 966 Anno Domini. I was sent to build a mine, they said we needed the resource to create more powerful infantry that would finally destroy our enemy – the Civilization which was just next to Łódź. Feared by everyone, the mighty Romanians never seemed to give up, their constant pressure just outside our borders always threatened our stability.There we were, minding our business digging the dirt when suddenly – “PRRRRTTTT, PRRRRTTTT, PRRR, PRTTTTTTT” – I swear it was a dragon farting in our direction closer and closer. I never seen anything like this. A gigantic metal behemoth powered fully by farts and leaving a black trail behind it with every move it took. My co-workers stood fearlessly while I, seeing a thing almost as godly as the sun was mesmerized. It came really close. Then it opened its mouth… and from that mouth exits a man – Fredderick Barbarossa – a friend of our King. “ AGAIN – he says proudly – WIR EXTEND UNSERE HAND, BUT ZIS TIME IN FREUNDSCHAFT. WILL DU ACCEPT IT!? “.What the ♥♥♥♥ is happening. He looks at me without a slightest movement. “ WIR OFFER TRADE, EIN APFEL FOR IHRE OIL, COAL, MARBLE, IHRE SCHAUFEL UND DAS PAITING BY QIU YING. WIR ALSO WANT THE SANDALS OF HAJI HUUD”. No reaction so far from my co-workers. I chose to communicate. “Excuse me sir. I’m just a worker, though it seems this trade is a bit unfair, don’t you think?”. He looks at me and shouts magnificently – “PERHAPS ANOTHER ZEIT THEN”. He turns around in his behemoth on the adjacent tile and after a moment shouts at us – “ LET DAS BE KNOWN. DU IST EINEN ENEMY OF GERMONEY. PREPAER FUR A BLITZKRIEG”. Another minute passes and I still can’t process what happened.And then the Winged hussars came.“ KUUUUUUUUURRRRRRWAAAAAAAAA” – the mighty horsemen charging at the behemoth were surely a mesmerizing view. The destruction of them not so much. The Roman emperor looks at us from his Eiffel tower with disdain. Dwight Eisenhower, the great Polish general grabbed my arm, looked into my eyes and said the words I will never forget – “It is the rule in war, if ten times the enemy's strength, surround them; if five times, attack them; if double, be able to divide them; if equal, engage them; if fewer, defend against them; if weaker, be able to avoid them ”.I never was a historian but something seemed odd.Surrounded by chaos, destruction and pain I was surprised by our King – Jadwiga the Deformed ( Perhaps the uranium deposit right under the palace is not great for health, by what could I know, she is alive since 4000 BC ). She says – “ witam Fredderick. I offer peace. You will give me everything you have for my guarantee of non aggression pact for 10 minutes?”. “ DAS IS FAIR, HERR JADWIGA THE WISE. LET IT BE KNOWN DAS GERMONEY IS A FRIEND OF POLAN.”Have you ever had a feeling something is not right? Dwight Eisenhower ordered the archers to shoot at enemy dog and his owner and German archers were shooting at our stealth bombers. But it’s not that.Something was out of place.“ WSHHHSHHHSHHHHHHHHHHH” – A gigantic fallus was going straight to space.From the middle of Warszawa.And a single voice could be heard from our renowned scientist – Abu Al- Qasim Al- Zahrawi –“POLAN CAN INTO SPACE”."

If you're okay with schizophrenic and terminally easymode AI, or only plan to play the game with humans, go for it."
36,707.5,Not Recommended," January 2, 2017",2,"Personally, I've enjoyed this latest addition to the Civilization series, the focus on each civ's abilities and unique bonuses give the game a greater variety and emphasis on which civ the player chooses. At the same time, the bonuses of each civ are spread out so a certain civ isn't limited to a single victory type. Compared to previous civ games, the biggest changes are in the districts/wonders and diplomacy. I like the new requirements for wonders and the fact that they take a tile, as it prevents one civ from building all the wonders in a single city, although sometimes the requirements might be a little too picky (ie The Great Zimbabwe needing to be adjacent to a cattle resource and commercial hub) and often prevent wonders from being built until much later in the game. In terms of the diplomatic game changes, I'm surprised and slightly disappointed by the removal of diplomatic victory and world congress. I enjoyed the world congress in civ 5 and it needed some work, but it definately added to the gameplay. I enjoy the new casus belli system, and I think it could be developed further to add more reasons. An additional casus belli for claimed land and forward settling (if a couple requests to stop settling near a player in the future are ignored/denied or a promise is broken, a small casus belli could be added for any cities within 6 tiles of one your own cities) could be added to deter overly expansive ai/players.Biggest Complaints:The art style of the civs is chaotic ranging from decent to garbage- leaders such as gandhi recieved rediculous cartooned features, while victoria recieves atleast a somewhat realistic image, but still cartoon. I'd prefer a return to the attempts at realism in civ 4.Diplomatic relations are next to impossible, to be friendly with a civ, you must appeal to both of their agendas and even then any little thing can set them off, and a friendship doesn't really grant you anything-in civ 5 your friends might denounce those you denounce or even declare war with you, not so in civ 6, everyone denounces eachother and declare meaningless wars.Civ 6 is a decent game, but its not worth $50+, the price needs to be atleast halved to be worth it."

Indeed, the game became more engaging, exciting and realistic.I would say Civ6 even in its current state is better than Civ5 with a full DLC bundle.The game looks very similar to Civ5, especially, if you disregard the new visual style.

40,416.6,Not Recommended, April 15,2,"Alright, this review is based on both the base game and the Rise & Fall expansion. And, ufortunately, I don't recommend them—yet.First, some positives: the art really is impressive. I was uncertain about the more cartoony style, especially after the epicness of the Civ V art, but having played a lot of games now I have to say that Firaxis really did a great job. The detail is impressive and WYSIWYG makes a triumphant return. The result is a more living world with lots of interesting tidbits to discover. I'm still trying to find all the hidden Firaxis logos...Okay, but what about the gameplay? Eh. The expansion improved a lot of the things that were most frustrating in the base game. However, diplomacy is still shallow and little hard to understand. Combining units into formations is... busywork? As are the governors. Ugh. And the bonuses both these features provide are hard to figure out and underwhelming.But they really haven't figured out how to fix what I felt was the biggest downside of the base game: the end game is boring and undynamic. What I mean is that, compared to the end game in Civ V Brave New World, pursuing victory is a bit of slog, and the conditions don't affect one another. Pursuing tourism, for example, gets you no benefit other than closer to the cultural victory, unlike in Civ V where improved tourism came with benefits for science, trade, conquest, etc.Will they get this figured out after a third expansion? Probably. But for now, if you can wait out Firaxis, do."
110,425.2,Recommended, February 17,2,"Civ 6 has many improvements from Civ 5. These improvements include:DistrictsThe greatest improvement and the one feature that makes it hard to go back to civ 5 is districts. Districts take up a tile in your city and give you a bonus. When looking at your city from a distance you can see all the districts and wonders you have built. It makes your city seem alive and it makes where you settle a city much more important.Civic TreeIn civ 6 there are now two trees to research through, the tech tree and the civic tree. It makes researching more interesting.Eurekas and InspirationsEach tech and civic now has a task you can do to make it 50% faster to research. An example is kill a unit with a slinger to boost archery by 50%. These new mechanics make researching more competitive.You can now win the game by converting everyone to your religion. This can sometimes get annoying when an AI player rushs for a victory this way.Builders build improvements instantly but only have 3 uses. This change fits in with the district system better than workers.There are many other small improvements but those are the 5 big changes.Most of the negative reviews complain about about:The DLCs have the same price as the DLCs that were released in civ 5 so nothing has changed. Most of the DLCs (besides the expansion) only add in 1 or 2 new civs so they aren't really game changing so unless you want to play as one of those civs don't buy them.The digital deluxe edition never said it would include a expansion. It only said the first 4 DLC packs. It was later updated to 6.This is the one complaint that makes sense and that I actually agree with. The AI is not perfect. I think this is mostly because of their agendas which make it almost impossible to make all of them happy. However the game is still fun even with how the AI is. Hopefully it will be improved in future patches and updatesAnother major complaint ive seen in other reviews is the art style. In my opinion the art style in 6 is less cluttered than 5. It is a bit more cartoony than 5. However anyone whos played any other civ game than civ 5 knows that the civilization series isnt about the graphics, and that civ 5 was the only game in the series that had realistic graphics."
227,41.6,Not Recommended, April 17,2,"The AI SUCKS. During the early stages of my first game (playing emporer difficulty), a neighboring nation declared war on me suddeny and for no apparent reason. I built up my defenses expecting a army to attack... they never came. A few turns later i decided to start attacking my opponent. I gathered a few units and was able to take a barely guarded city at the edge of my opponents empire.Since i really didn't want to deal with war further, I started peace negotiations with my opponent. Can you guess what my rival offered me in exchange for peace? 6 of their 7 cities, including their existing CAPITAL. This lead to me absolutely domminating the match with almost no challenge whatsoever. When i saw this, my heart sunk because i sensed that something was dreadfully wrong with this game. Yet i kept on playing in hopes that these events were just a fluke. They Weren't.Almost every match I played after the one described above was plagued with horrible AI decsisions and just a lack of chellenge or fun. Any challenge the game does provide is a product of the AI being given cheese bonuses rather than making smart or strategic decsisions. The whole thing just feels manufactured, fake, and cheap.I was hoping the DLC would correct these problems. From the reviews i've seen others give that appears to not be the case. Extremely dissapointed. A terrible addition to an otherwise great series. Firaxis should focus less on shoehorning femal leaders and more on making a game with functioning AI."

That's when it loads - for some reason after the first day I bought it it starts locking up on the load screens. As a matter of fact, 'slow' is the best way to describe everything in the game.

Just arbitrary delays before menu options appear.3. The AI is broken. No, I don't even know if its broken - I think its mainly an RNG with some slight modification due to leader traits. I've got guys telling me I'm a cultural backwater when I've got the highest culture rating and am a third of the way to a cultural victory and they're not even a blip. Another guy keeps telling me to be careful about debt - when I have a large income and a massive treasury. I get attacked by one guy, then when I don't agree to his piece treaty immediately everyone denounces me as a warmonger - the guy who hadn't fired a shot at anyone in 250 turns. None of it matters anyway - they're all going ot hate you if you start winning.4. The animated leaders are a marketing gimmick. They add nothing, you can't do anything until the animation is done playing and then wait for a long pause before the options menu comes up. Turn them off.5. Turns start off slow and get slower.

Ever. Never a reason to because the only agressive people in the game were the barbarians.I've had a guy tell me off for running a debt - with 5000 gold and a 500 gold/turn income *and* not not having bought anything at all for at least 10 turns.Guys thanking me for fighting off barbarians - when the last battle I had had with the barb was 30 turns earlier.Trading? Way screwed up. These guys are willing to give you 30 - 50 gold a turn for a luxury item. And its easy to game the system as it will tell you exactly what they will and will not accept. What they offer is so low-balled compared to what you can get them to go for its disgusting.This is just a bad game.Oh, and it has that ♥♥♥♥ing annoying 2k thing where you get the 'do you want to log on to your 2k account now?' popup.

Civ VI is less interesting, beautiful and attractive as previous titles. The whole look of the game is disgusting. Low resolution models on a maximum graphics, horrible cartoon unit animations with ""KABOOM"" effects and so on.The interface is cheap and icons are rude. Ah, too much pain writing this.The development of the city loss the handy interface from Civ V and becomes clunky. This can be appealed to all mechanics. I just can't understand, how this could happen.AI is just stupid. Barbarians captured the worker and leave it be. He was just standing few turns, I skip few more, nothing changes. Also, they don't like to pillage. Other Civilization start a war with just 1 catapult and warrior, that was standing still. Other Civ starts a war with tons of chariots, that need to overcome like 25 hexes. Only one can managed to do it.Unfortunately, it seems for me as a degradation of the series: graphics, gameplay and optimizations seems much poorer then in previous titles. So sad.

192,75.9,Not Recommended," February 23, 2017",6,"A straight downgrade from Civ 5. Maybe it will follow the civ tradition and have every expansion back be a great overhaul of the system, but as it currently stands this game simply isn't worth full price.Visuals: the most subjective category, but I find this game wholly unappealing artistically. The Civ leaders look like pixar rejects and the landscapes are bland and uninspired.UI: The UI is a mess, with often incredibly important information hidden or poorly represented. It also takes an egregious amount of clicks to accomplish simple tasks, like re-assigning spies to a location they are already at. Individually this wouldn't matter as much but the number and rapidity of it across a 300+ turn game is very aggravating.Music: Seems like it's mostly variations of the same track modified over the years. After my first game I was already muting in favor of a playlist in the background. Also the quotes are garbage.AI: Arguably the most incompetent released in the franchise, at least this decade. If you played civ 5 at X difficulty you can basically bump it up by 1-2 in Civ 6 because outside of early game rushes the AI is completely worthless at waging a war. Also, AI are pretty much insane, and establishing reliable relationships with one is all but impossible. Bonus points; even if you do succeed in this, they will still arbitrarily declare war on you just because. There is no late-game diplomacy akin to the U.N., so by industrial period most everyone dislikes you but it doesn't actually affect anything, turning the end of the game into a monotonous slog.Game mechanics: Aside from the fact that the game is still significantly unbalanced, there are many problems plaguing this title. The change to workers being charged base means you have to waste time spamming them into your build queues, but doesn't really add anything to the game in terms of enjoyment or skill, it's just micro-management for its own sake. Wonders take a ridiculous time to build (50-80 turns) and take up a tile, so they're often not worth it at all. Districts, what should have been the great new addition to the title, have mostly been relegated to a few essentials that are spammed forever due to the aforementioned imbalance. Lastly, the removal of any kind of happiness or corruption mechanic means that every empire will go wide every single game because there are no reasons not to. While going tall was a bit too reliable in Civ 5, swinging hard the other way isn't actually better.At the end of the day, I kick myself for buying this game so soon after launch. Take my advice and just tide yourself over with something else until they bother to fix this mess, because until then it's really not worth your time or money."

71,577.7,Recommended," July 15, 2017",6,"I've been playing religiously since Civ 3 with a collective 2500+ hours into the series and dabbled with Civ 1 (SNES) and Civ 2. I've put in 420+ hours into Civ 6 so far. I paid full price upon release for the digital deluxe edition. I am satisfied with its current direction and look forward to seeing this game improve with future expansions and as the selection of mods are refined and added upon.Many are quick to compare this newest installment to its fully fleshed out predecessor Civ 5 and complain that it's a step backwards. However, there's almost 7 years difference between both games. There's tons of expansions, DLCs, and mod development between them.Historically, every new release of Civ had an incubation period before it outdid its fully fleshed-out predecessor. I remember very well how much Civ 5 was lambasted by the community upon release - people were calling it the death of the series. After expansions, it's now hailed as the pinnacle of the series.Civ 6 has enough improvements (and yes, some regressions) for early adopters to enjoy and turn a blind eye to its drawbacks until it improves with the expansions. If you want to play a fully fleshed out and cheaper Civ, play 5. If you want to experiment with new features and can tolerate the drawbacks, play 6.I'm of the opinion that Civ 6 is a great entry into the series despite its initial flaws. I really enjoy the implementation of districts. I think each civ feels distinguishable in their play styles, and they feel relatively balanced - I feel you can use anyone and focus on a set of possible victory types that are best suited for that civ and make it work. Believe it or not, I'm actually a fan of the agendas too. The barbs are actually manageable despite what people say, albeit it takes way more micromanagement than in previous Civ games. The civ AI is really not that much different from Civ 5 in terms of challenge, I think. Warmongering penalties in my opinion make sense since they've last updated it, although I like using a mod that eliminates penalties in the Classical era in addition to the standard Ancient era - just my personal preference. I also use a mod that slows down science and civic progression by 2x while keeping building and unit production costs standard so I get to spend more time in each era. I do feel that they need to tweak the pace of production vs. culture vs. science. I think science and civics progress way too quickly to make use of newly trained units before they become obsolete - that said, the 2x ""Take Your Time"" mod does a good job of remedying that.Which brings me to my next point, a lot of the things people complain about are actually easily addressed with popular and well-maintained Steam Workshop mods (or outside of Workshop). Lack of a restart button to re-roll maps? There's a mod for that. Production queue? There's a mod for that. Crappy UI? There's mods for that. Better contrast for the fog of war? A mod for that. More challenging and 'smarter' AI? - Mod. For. That. - I could go on...Yes, absolutely there are some known bugs (even without mods). For one, you can immediately make peace with a hostile city-state after their suzerain declares war on you - this is to your advantage in single player anyway, so at least it's not frustrating, but it does break multiplayer a tiny bit if you intend to be competitive. Also, if you've conquered an AI civ's city, there's a bug that makes the negative ""occupying their city"" modifier stick, even if you trade that conquered city away to another civ. Finally, the game will crash on occasion, but for me its been pretty reliable thus far. It happens mostly when I alt-tab a lot.Besides bugs and crashes, there's some poorly planned out mechanics. My prime example is as follows: you can build a district on a tile, and later on if a strategic resource appears on the same tile, you'll still be able to use that resource without issues - great. However, should you want to build a district on a tile with a newly discovered resource that cannot be harvested (such as coal), then having discovered that new resource essentially blocks you from using what was previously a valid tile to build the district on. It just doesn't make a whole lot of sense.I'm confident that those above-mentioned issues will be addressed in due time. My one and only gripe about Civ 6 that can't really be fixed is the art direction and aesthetic of the 3D assets (units, tile sets, buildings, etc. - the civ leaders I think are actually really well done). I wish they had stuck with and expanded upon the more realistic look of Civ 5. I'm really not digging the cartoony look, and I admit, it makes me feel like they focus-grouped it to make the game more appealing to the mass market. That said, it's still objectively pretty to look at and relaxing.Reading some of the other comments on here, I feel that some of the grievances are misplaced. When I look at this 'vanilla' release compared to the disaster of Civ 5's initial release, this one is a much bigger improvement by that standard, and with time, I'm sure we're going to be revisiting the same cyclical narrative and hailing Civ 6 with expansions as the pinnacle of the series and bickering about how Civ 7 is a step backwards.Just make sure that when you buy Civ 6 that you are willing to take on the experience and with some expectation to get frustrated or underwhelmed with some of its aspects, but at least know that it's going to get better with age. I trust Firaxis enough at this point to have that much faith in them."

Most of your time is spent buidling beautiful, sprawling, unique cities with intricaltely crafted animations and gorgeously detailed landscapes.Since it's release, the game has been improved through updates and DLC. Sadly much of the AI interaction here feels pretty hackneyed and that's a missed opportunity. When you see the graphics you'll realize where most of your dollars were spent. The game looks and runs fantastically smooth on in 21.9. (brag) Everything about the game graphically, is top notch. The day/night cycle, the smoke, the fires, the characters, and the geography, it all looks amazing! The audio is excellent too. Every player action carries a sublimely satisfying sound cue. Sean Bean is also excellent as the narrator. His subtle and dramatic interpretations of popular quotes and phrases are often compelling. Rarely do I tire of his reading of Monty Python, but after many many plathroughs, I yearn for variety. I really liked the non-fictional/educational aspects of the game.Long Story Short: It's beautiful looking and it sounds great, but it can be dumb at times. I'm looking at you city-states.

108,204.6,Recommended," September 24, 2017",6,"So, starting out, I think Civ 5 is better (with all of its expansions). However, I've put many hours now into Civ 6 and I do think it is fun, and overall I would recommend. I think the game can be much better, and I do hope they fix stuff moving forward.Positives:- Graphics/art direction are really nice- Loooove Sean Bean in this- Gameplay is overall easy to learn and at its most fun when playing against other humans.- I like the idea of the religious war/victory- I really like the districts and the fact that you can't spam wonders (that they take a tile per each). I like the increased strategy that comes along with the district and wonder building and planning out your cities.- I like the different civilizations in the game so far, they each are pretty fun and each has a slightly different play style which has been fun to learn and try to do well with.- I think tile strategy has been improved with the amenity and appeal systems.Negatives- The religious victory and fighting is too simplistic.- The AI is the biggest drawback IMO. They are really stupid about diplomacy, will often give you their great works for pennies, are weird about trading, and dumb about war. The way the AI agendas are implemented by them seems to be poorly thought out. How the AI treats religion is one of the most annoying aspects of this game. As soon as they get religion, they will generate somehow like 3000 missionaries and spam your cities. The only way to deal with this is to either work to up your faith output so as to buy apostles (which may or may not even win trying to kill them before they die themselves), or you have to declare war on them to kill them with military units. If you are trying for a cultural or scientific victory, this is an incredibly annoying distraction.- The city/empire size balance is non-existent. Civ 5 allowed you to win with just one city. Civ 6 basically demands you build a ton of cities.- Cultural and scientific victories can take too long and be a little boring. They both need to be a little more special or have more nuance.- There is no production queue like there was in Civ 5. I would really love to see that make its way into this game.- Like Civ 5, team play is not well implemented.- The espionage system needs help - the spies rarely seem that useful."

392,20.8,Not Recommended," November 9, 2016",6,"I gave Civ VI another play through and I still don't recommend it because the game is too narrowly focused on starting location-- it just doesn't have enough balance. In Civ V, getting the best start location in multiplayer helped, but in Civ IV, you NEED certain tiles near your start location. Since chaining Eureka bonuses relies havily on certain resources being nearby, you need a good start to get tech boosts; without those, it will take you twice as long to research a tech as someone who might just have better access near their start location. Tech progression alone dramatically increases the effect of a good or bad start location compared to Civ V. Similarly, not having a certain strategic resource near your starting location could hamstring your ability to build an army (or even defend against barbarians) for an entire era since some eras have multiple units requiring the same resource (nitre, being key for a while). The new amenities feature replacing happiness seems under-developed, and success in amenities depends heavily on your starting location. If you get a bad start and it will be impossible to keep your people happy no matter what your play style, and you'll eventually get rebel barbarians spawning in your territory. War weariness then makes the game un-fun to play-- in the old games, when things weren't going your way, you could at least try to do some damage, maybe wrest a city or two from an adversary-- here, the war weariness will produce barb units in your territory faster than your best cities could produce similar units, and these will pillage every tile while your army is away fighting (or even winning) a war. The time scale is also off-- multiplayer quick games on small maps in Civ V could usually be finished in four hours if people kept the game moving. In Civ VI, it takes drastically more turns to produce anything, creating even slower gameplay; this extended production scale not only increases the effectiveness of units versus building a strong civ, but it also makes even quick games take longer, which means most multiplayer won't be able to be completed in a single afternoon. The formula for unit disbanding is much more unforgiving in this game, such that if your treasury ever dips even slightly below zero, you may lose several units a turn, instantly eliminating the effort of some twenty or thirty turns it took to produce those units. This is not at all fun-- especially because a single spy might steal from the treasury, destroying an army in one chain reaction of disbanding events. There are a number of things I would classify as bugs-- a heavy drone of mechanized units versus other background sounds or unit sounds not playing on some zoom levels-- both are jarring. Also, in single-player the AI will ask for peace nearly every trun, or to send you some emisarries, no matter how many times you say no; if there were an option to turn off the cutscenes, this might be tolerable, but the repetition quickly eats away any enjoyment of interacting with AI civs in general."

The graphics are derpy and cartoonish, the AI seems very sensitive and easily gets offended at minor things. They took a lot out of this game and replaced it with minimal shiny objects which are pleasent for two or three turns until you have a large landmass of pointless things.The biggest thing that bothers me is there is no exploration like the old civ games...at the start you fart to your left and meet another leader, grunt to your right and bump into another, the third walks into your borders on turn 4...and thats on a huge map. Huge map is now roughly half the size of the old ones by the looks of things, making it seem very quick and pushed. The city states are more independant on this one and not as ""please protect me"" which is good...but when you offer to work with one...2 or 3 other leaders sulk because they can't addapt to being civil with one another...Ghandy still loves nukes and being a C-U-N-T.Overall, this needs to be revised in a few areas, stop being an elementary school learning software and buff up the realism of leaders being selfish, self preservative a-holes democracy controlling the media...would like to see the visuals ammended to being more realistic and the AI being more human-like alongside some good old fashioned Civ and not the sims 5 which is cautious to offend anyone.4/10..."

236,153.1,Recommended," November 5, 2016",6,"When I saw that they had announced a new CIV game and I then saw that it wasn’t going to be some silly space or other type of strategy game I was ecstatic. Then when I got to some of the screenshots I was less so. Once I saw the new art style I was less excited and even considering ignoring the game completely, but that was a stupid idea as you shouldn’t judge a book by its cover, and to be fair it has grown on me.Now this game is great right now and works very well. There are some things that are missing that use to be in CIV 5, but mainly they’re not a problem for me. The only thing that I miss is the World Congress. There are some minor features that I never used, but were very popular and to be fair not hard to add into the game that should have been there, like being able to name cities. With that being said though there are many, many more things that have been added that make the game better. I now feel that all the different types of victory are much more achievable and interesting. Along with the improved victories there are also some change to the policies and civics that are amazing. They have now moved items that are less tech related and more civic related into their own tree, this makes everything a lot, lot better as it means that less time is being wasted on techs that aren’t really techs. The new policy system is great. Instead of choosing a tree to follow you instead choose a government style like democracy, fascism or communism and then you have a certain amount of policies you can assign and type of policies depends on the government style. So a fascist government will be able to have more military policies than the others. I also like the new way roads are built. And one of the last things that I love before I move onto the negatives is the new way that wonders are built. This new system is great and makes displaying and showing the wonders off amazing. Instead of it just saying that you’ve built a wonder it will now give you a short movie of its construction along with a quote. This is great. And the new levelling for units is great.Now for some of the negatives. There are some minor features that are missing that should be in, like the city naming, and other such things, but I never really used most of these so I haven’t noticed their disappearance. I do miss the world congress. And they still haven’t really fixed AI war. They’re more aggressive when they declare war on you, which I like, but when you ally with them they’re not much use. They’re defence is a lot better though. And the new builders are interesting, I like the way they work, but I also find that I am missing out on a lot of work tiles because I can’t find them. And this use to be fixable as you would just set a work to auto and they’d hook it up.So all in all I would recommend this to anyone. Whether they’ve played CIV 5 or never even played a CIV I would still recommend it to them. To be honest with all the recent games that have come out I’ve been disappointed, but this one of the only ones that I don’t regret it at all.Great game.Great new features and systems.Some minor issues.9/10"

174,500.3,Recommended," September 24, 2017",18,"TLDR: Civ 6 is a solid and fun addition to the civ series. Pro - Polished, features complement each other, civ gameplay that gives the ""one-more-turn-phenomenon."" Con - AI cannot handle features and 1 unit per tile. Diplomacy is still bad. Late game usually falls flat like previous Civ games. The UI is worse than Civ 5 UI.Civ 6 pros and cons, and mixed feelings...Pros:In my opinion, all of the games features work well together. It feels like a really complex, well-made board game. New mechanics/systems that I think work well include the new workers, civics, governments, the appeal mechanic, housing and aminities.Cons:Mixed feelings:Civ 6 is a solid civ game. I have been playing civilization series since civ 3, and I have enjoyed all of them. Its hard for me to pick a favorite, but if forced to I would have to pick civ 4. I have put hundreds of hours into each, and I think each of them had strengths and weaknesses.Civ 6 was probably the best launch of any civ game I played. It was a complete game from the start. People say it is missing features, but honestly it has a ton of features. It added a lot of new mechanics, kept most old mechanics/systems, has good graphics, and maintained the hex grid/1 unit per tile game play that made civ 5 unique and complex.With all this in mind, I want to address the complaint most people bring up with every civ game. The AI. From this point, I will mainly be discussing the Civ 6 AI, and it is more of a discussion rather than a review.The civ 6 AI sucks. I suspected it would suck. Every civ AI has sucked horribly since I started playing civ 3. However, in Civ 3-4, the horrible AI got to stack all their units and it was not quite as apparent how bad the AI was in those games because the game was ""simpler."" With 1 unit per tile and increasing # of features/mechanics that have been implemented in Civ over time, the flaws in AI become obvious.Civ 6 is by far the most complex civ game I have played in the series. This is not a complement. I think it is a bit too complex. AI cannot handle complexity, and it makes the game look silly sometimes. I don't think people realize how complex it is to make a game that is 1 unit per tile with all the features included in civ 6. Every new game the map is randomized. Each tile has random features. Now, you throw ~8 civs on this new random map, with some random city-states, random barbarian placements, and resources.Now the map is generated and the civs (with their unique special bonuses) are placed on a map relatively randomly. You will begin to move through a tech tree where the units/districts/resources available are always changing at a different pace for each civ on the map. New to civ 6, your research/progress is map-dependent. You have to find things/accomplish things to speed up your research. Also new to civ 6 you're placing districts and wonders on the map. The AI has to have some sort of programing to make decisions. The game is complex, and I am not sure that AI that can be run on computers that meet the min requirements is robust enough to handle it.So what happens? In order to make the AI competitive, high difficulty civ AI cheats. The AI cheats in every Civ title. In Civ 6 they spam districts and units, but they do it poorly. They throw units away in war. They cannot handle 1 unit per tile combat. This is a huge negative in my opinion. However, it does NOT ruin the game.The game is still fun, it still has the civ charm. You can still min/max your civ making super power economy, high-tech military, or a tourist culture. I played it day after day at launch and really did enjoy it. At launch, I was playing on diety and winning most games. However, after one of the first big patches I had trouble on immortal and always lost on diety. Considering I always played civ 5 on immortal, I feel like the developers already had a sense of how to start changing (or buffing?) the AI to properly challenge hardcore civ fanatics. I am assuming I would still struggle to win on diety now. This does not mean the AI got ""better"" it just means the developers made changes to higher difficulty AI to appropriately challenge the hardcore gamer. I typed up this review because I honestly felt the huge number of negative reviews does not really reflect the quality of this game.Civ 6, in spite of its flaws, is good. Worth buying on sale for sure. I bought it at launch, and I do not regret it."

267,82.2,Recommended," October 22, 2016",3,"Game of the year here gentlemen.From refined systems, to unstacked cities to beautiful animations, world map and my personal favorite the OST.Civ. 6 builds up on its predecessors and takes the best parts of them and further polishing them.Gameplay:My favourite change for the gameplay is the specialized districts which adds another layer of strategy as well as making it easier to manage your cities once your civilization gets huge. Next is the tech tree and Eureka moments which help you plan out which way you want to progress in terms of tech. THe new Great Person points and overview is a nice touch and can help you pick best Person which fit your playstyle.Stacking units is back but only to a limit of 3 and thats a good thing unless u were a fan of civ. 4 deck wars.My only dissapointment is lack of Civs. I wish there were more civs but i understand that 2K and Firaxis focus on getting the systems right and game working. I hope more civs will be added in future *looking at you Poland and winged Hussars*-Lack of sceneriosGraphics:First reveal, many people had complaints the graphics were too cartoon-ish. Personally I find it quite asthetically pleasing and units/cities show minor differences depending on civs you are playing for example Greek Swordsman have little Spartan helmets which other civs dont. Animations for combat are beautiful such as the last kill would be a unique animation for example plaing as legion the last unit that gets killed has an animation of legion knocking them to the ground with a shield then proceed to jump over them while stabbing them. The way fog of war works is superb and you can even tell which tiles in your city are being worked on as well as buildings/wonders/districts being constructed turn by turn.Sound.Sean Bean in my opinion is a good replacement for Leonard Nimroy to be the narrator. Firaxis game even got him to record a line for which his meme is famous for (that made me chuckle when I first heard it). Christopher Tin is back and has composed an amazing opening theme that rivals to Baba Yetu. Each civilization has its own theme that changes as game progresses through. For example if you are playing Russian Civ. or meet them you can hear snippets of Kalinka which is a well known Russian song and so forth.Final Thoughts.The game is on good track I am sure people who have put in over 20 hours or so can point out finer things that I didn't pick up yet. Let's hope the devs keep a pusle on the game and interact with community and hopefully improve the game as well as giving us more content to fiddle with"

120,27.9,Not Recommended, January 5,3,"I loved the civilization games in the past. However, with this game and attempting to play a full game I have been left angry and disappointed. A ""feature"" of the game where spy’s are able to steal gold has ruined the experience for me. I went from making over 250 gold per turn to being bankrupt in less than 10 turns. The negative gold is not shown and can be prepared for. You are not even able to defend against it as your spies get disbanded for having negative gold. I cannot refund this as it is a late game feature and the time is up. This has existed and is known for over a year now and has not been addressed at all. I am left disappointed and frustrated."
266,16.7,Recommended," October 25, 2016",3,"Civilization VI is a welcome addition to the series that fine tunes the gameplay of Civilization V in many ways. It is a much better launch title than Civilization V, containing virtually all the content of previous Civilization games and then some. However, some long standing issues in the franchise still remain, and may even be worse than before.First off, Civilization VI is not going to revolutionize how you play Civilization. It has many adjustments and additions, but the formula is fairly standard. The districts and the culture tree are the two biggest additions. The former adds a new layer to city building. Districts have better bonuses than standard buildings in previous games, but they take more production to build, and also use up an entire tile near your city. They are highly specialized, and locked by population count, so your cities can't possibly hope to acquire them all. In the end, you have to pick and choose which district is more viable for which city. The civics tree is also a very cool new way to handle the culture mechanics. Let's face it: culture in Civ V was dull. You open a screen, find your favored bonus, and press a button. The system has now been completely changed. You are given a civics tree, which can unlock buildings and governments, but primarily unlocks policies. Your government type restricts you to a certain number of policies of each type (there are 3 policy types and a wildcard policy). This creates a very dynamic way of managing culture.City-state interaction has also been vastly improved. Now, you gain influence in a city-state by sending envoys. These are primarily gained through diplomatic policies. The more envoys you send, the more bonuses you unlock from the city state. Militaristic city-states grant bonuses to unit production. Mercantile city-states grant additional gold. Religious city-states give you more faith, and cultural city-states give you, well, culture. If you have more than 6 envoys AND more envoys than other civilizations, the city-state becomes your vassal. They help you in war time and such, and also grant massive bonuses.Graphics aren't super important to Civilization, but my opinion on the graphics of Civ VI is mixed. On one hand, the animations are great and the environments are as gorgeous as ever, but I am not a fan of how the cities look. I liked the dynamically expanding cities of Civ V that grew with population count and actively incorporated wonders and buildings into the scenery. Everything is out of scale and cartoony now, but this will likely make older Civ players feel right at home. I also wasn't a fan of the music. The main theme is gorgeous, as always, but the in-game music is rather weak by comparison. Chances are, you will turn it off after 10 minutes and listen to a podcast instead.The only area the game really suffers is the AI, and by extension diplomacy. The AI is terrible. You are guaranteed to be at war with every other civ at some point in a match. They don't make alliances or friendships, not even for strategic gain. They wait until you are weak and declare war on you, all while berating you for being evil (I'm looking at you Saladin, you ♥♥♥♥ing hypocrite). There are almost no interactions that you can have with other civilizations besides trade deals (that they won't honor), requests to stop screwing with you (that they won't follow), and demands (that they won't cave to). The AI goes beyond stubborn and falls into outright psychotic territory at times.The game also lacks some features of Civ V, believe it or not. All of them relate to customization. You are far more limited on map types now. There are a grand total of THREE scenarios to chose from, which is pretty sad. There are not nearly as many toggleable options like Raging Barbarians (probably because it seems to be set to on by default, judging by how hard the barbarians in this game are). You can no longer name civilizations, leaders, or cities. All of these things will be missed, but they aren't bad enough losses to really hold the game down, and it adds so much in other areas that it becomes a worthy trade-off.All in all, Civilization VI is certainly a good game. It is a shame that flaws that are endemic to the series (like bad AI) have not been addressed, but none-the-less it is still a fantastic title and well worth it to long time Civilization fans."

They're really nice and cartoony, and the animation in the leader screens is flawless.Leader and civilization traits are so much more diverse and useful now, with the unique units and buildings really making each civ stand out.The Bad:The gap between turn times is very very long. It's not a huge problem, but having to turn on quick movement and combat to complete a game in a realistic timeframe just kinda ruins it.Oh look, the rise and fall expansion has come out. The price is even more extortianate now, and if I have to pay extra to make a game playable... no thanks. I understand you need to make a profit, but it's getting ridiculous.The price tag is also a bit... big.

Oh, by the way, everyone thinks I'm a warmonger now. (In fact, you get dubbed a warmonger just for defending yourself). Oh well, I've got infantry by this point, they're all renaissance and industrial plebs. Oh look, China declared war on me because I built a wonder, and their agenda doesn't like that. They throw a hissy fit.(5 musketmen from China turn up)(They die to a large amount of my infantry)I let China go with a peace deal, but the entire world thinks I'm a warmonger. However China's just doing fine, without anyone calling them a warmonger.You see, this is what ruins the game.

283,33.1,Recommended, February 15,3,"A good series has sequels that iterate on their successors and build on them. The Civ series isn't like that, yet each game ends up being good. Civ VI is good. Great, sometimes. It's just not the new hotness it should be, but it could be there in the future.As a disclaimer, my experience with Civ VI is almost entirely with the new Rise and Fall expansion. As is the case with all Civ games, the expansions are vital.There's a lot of new features here that work pretty well, and some old ones that are tweaked for convenience and are generally better. City management has gotten the biggest overhaul this time, and I like it. Instead of being able to just build anything available in your city centers, you have to build districts that physically occupy tiles. Build them in certain areas, you can get bonuses for their respective outputs (science, culture, production, etc.) Waging war have been overhauled, now with different types of wars with varying penalties. Religious victories are a more active experience than before, requiring religious combat and inquisitions. Roads are streamlined now, made by just sending your traders out to build them as they go. Where some games in Civ V had very few roads in them, Civ VI is littered with them by the halfway point. Spies are producible now.The Rise and Fall expansion, which, again, you should buy, adds governors, loyalty, and golden age overhauls. Civs can lose their cities to rebellions if loyalty is low, which makes them ripe for the taking. Or, liberate and return them for diplomacy. Establish governors to build loyalty and upgrade them with useful buffs for the city. Achieve enough 'era events' and enter golden ages. Don't achieve enough, and you'll enter a dark age.I mentioned this game wasn't quite 'there yet,' and it's mostly because of what's missing, not what's there being bad. Diplomatic victories and the World Congress didn't make a return, and they really should have. That's the big one.The art direction is wonderful, and the map is a lot more visually interesting than the previous games. Leaders are expressive in their diplomacy screens and have a lot of personality. Sean Bean is a great narrator.Civ VI is good. It could be, and I believe it will be, better."

The AI is irrational and nonsensical to the point where the game becomes an exercise in patience.The balance of most civilisations is poor and needs reworking.AI are completely incapable of any sort of strategic thinking during war and are often very easy to take out (especially naval warfare).Natural wonders in the game are almost entirely useless.In its current state, I would say that this game is simply not worth it unless you intend to play it online against friends or other real players. To summarise; The aethetics of the game are highly polished and is immediately brought down by the terrible and deeply flawed AI, for now, best avoid this game and look at other titles."

The units are only in groups of 4 instead of a squad of 12 like in civ 5 which makes the battles a lot less exciting, although the new finisher animations are kinda cool. I liked how the new builder will complete their task in one turn but can only be used a limited amount of times. The coolest new game mechanic is the districts, it is so much visulaly apealing to fill your land with differend districts than tons of farms and trading posts. The wonders are much biger now and you get to watch them slowly build over time which is a realy cool new mechanic. The AI for the civs has more depth and can be very confusing but that just takes time to get used to. over all in the mecanics this is a solid game other than the AI wich can get pretty buggy but still playable.

AI declare war on you without provocation, I had 5 different civs attack me at once (Within the first 5 turns of the game, mind you) for simply being peaceful. Naval units are the most useless things I've ever used in a civ game. AIs over-extend far too much, often having more than 10 cities in the first hundred or so turns. If you're looking for a good civ game, go play civ 5 or 4. They're MUCH better than this abomination.EDIT: Yes I realize i only have 20 hours in this game but my review will explain why.Having played 600+ hours on Civ V and hopping over to VI a few weeks after it came out, I am underwhelmed. The AI is poorly made, There is no build queue, You weren't even able to rename your cities when it first came out. They ALREADY HAVE DLC. What a horrible way to kick off a game.I can only honestly recommend this game if you play with friends and ONLY with friends. Unless of course you're sadistic and you play against the easy-as-pie Deity AI then go right ahead and do that.But in all seriousness I simply cannot recommend this game in its current state... at least not until it's fixed up and has an actual workshop. I know I have basically been repeating the same stuff as all the other reviews so let me add something of my own.A major problem (in my opinion) with this game is the fact that multiplayer is STILL broken. It was broken in Civ V and now it is broken again. Whenever there is a turn timer and someone disconnects, the game freezes up and does not let the turns progress. HUGE oversight with both games that I feel needs to be addressed.PROS:The district system is very well-done. It adds an extra depth to the game that the others didn't. Good job on that regard, Firaxis.The trade route system. The fact that roads are built as a result of having a trade caravan is a good addition in my opinion.Loading times. YES PLEASE. The loading times have been SIGNIFICANTLY reduced in this installment of the Civ franchise. Instead of waiting 20 minutes for the game to load and another 10 to load up a map like in Civ V, it now takes a minute or two to load the game AND the map combined. Well done.All in all, go buy Civ V with all the DLC if you want to have a good time. Don't play Civ VI unless you're a masochist or something. AI is garbage, multiplayer is broken, there is no build queue, there is already DLC. This is a sad excuse for a Civ game, to say the very least."
160,92.4,Not Recommended," June 26, 2017",3,"After 92 hours of gameplay already I am let say distraught on how the devs made this. Feels like a waste of time and a waste of a perfectly good game. Civ 5 I clocked over 500 hours into thanks to excellent AI and units. Civ 6 has numerous problems with its AI... constant suprise wars for no reason whatsoever and if you start a war all the more reason for more wars to be declared onto you, theres no leyway no halfway mark it will JUST HAPPEN even if you were friends with them.I understand the difficulty but this is ridiculous they wont start wars on themselves to start with through to the medival age (if you even get that far), you get double teammed on so you take attacks from both sides (im not saying thats a flaw thats a clever tactic), but to me this has happened every single game ive played no change when I change the options in players difficulty, random maps and resources, you will get hit straight away making starts on classic age and up all the more impossible.Other AI issues invovle that they lack the ability to level up their units. When I have helicopters and battleships the AI with have crossbows, spearmen etc etc. Almost as if they have no balance when to building cities and place themselves anywhere, this then ♥♥♥♥♥ on the challenge for late gameplay and you go around knocking out cities and units that I havnt used that unit for in at least 2000 years.For a game that was released back in late 2016 and civ 5 was released 2014 makes you wish beyond earth never existed (and lets be honest it might as well not have) so they would put their resources and time into making a better civ 6. I would love to recommend this as im a massive fan of the series I love their concept and idea and most of civ 6 new concepts are a massive improvement to civ 5 making everything simpler but for good reasons and spreading out your districts for a better producing city, but this has started to becoming a burden of simplistic AI and poor gameplay im going to have put this one down. Will possibly change review if devs start listening to the player base for once however at this moment in time nothing has changed and the patches released just keep polishing a turd. Shame."

332,51.3,Recommended," October 30, 2016",3,"Civilization VI is an interesting idea - flawed, but still hopeful. If you've played Civilization V, you know what you're getting yourself into. However this time around science has been split up into tech and culture trees, meaning you'll want a good balance of both. And really that's what Civ VI excels at this time around, balance. Just about every move you make will have positive and negative repercussions down the line and everything is equally important. So just what is the most important to focus on?Mercifully Civilzation VI plays well even without intense micromanagement, and overal is a fun experience. But as I said before it is still flawed. As of this review, diplomacy is a bit one-sided and the numbers could use some adjustment. On top of that Culture victories feel a bit wonky and not as well implemented as it was in the previous game. Religious victories are tedious as well and feel more like a different version of a Domination victory. A bunch of things that can and probably will be fixed in upcoming patches and DLC expansions.If you're a big Civ fan, you'll probably enjoy VI. If you want to jump in for the first time, I'd recommend playing V with all DLCs first to get a good understanding of what you're getting into as it still feels more like a complete experience. Again, after a few patches and expansions, VI will be able to shine fully, but until then, I wouldn't blame you if you wanted to wait."
181,396.9,Not Recommended," December 17, 2016",3,"PositivesThe general aesthetics of the game is fantastic and looks great.The UI of the game is easy to understand and use.Game is smooth and clearly optimised well, especially during the “late game” which often hampered previous iterations.Some of the victory conditions have been better fleshed out and now with the inclusion of the religious victory.The introduction of districts as containers for buildings is excellent and makes you forward think with city planning.NegativesThe AI is completely and utterly atrocious to the point where it fundamentally ruins the game and is the reason why I simply cannot recommend it. The AI is irrational and nonsensical to the point where the game becomes an exercise in patience.In its current state, I would say that this game is simply not worth it unless you intend to play it online against friends or other real players. To summarise; The aethetics of the game are highly polished and is immediately brought down by the terrible and deeply flawed AI, for now, best avoid this game and look at other titles."

Without them this game is bad. REAL BAD."
100,172.5,Not Recommended, January 17,3,"In a trend that seems more and more prevalent nowadays, Firaxis has taken everything good about the previous 5+ games, and tossed it all out the window in favor of building what amounts to an entirely new system.Gone is the ability to build what you want in your cities. Now you have to carefully manage the zones around your cities to make sure you can put in the things you want... in other words, study the lists of districts and plan what is going to go in every zone you can reach. Only three coastal spaces in this city? Better not place that required Harbor in the wrong spot if you want both a Great Lighthouse and the Colossus. Need to build the Forbidden Palace? Oh, sorry. If you do you'll have to wipe out your only iron mine because you already needed the other 5 spaces.Sorry, I don't want to have to sit here and make a 10,000 year plan for what is going where for each and every city. Civ games take long enough when you are actually playing. Forcing me to sit down and writing out a 3 page plan for each and every city is ridiculous. But if you don't, you will likely forget what you wanted where at some point during your 25 hour game and screw up the whole plan.Then we have religions. Oh religions. Such a critical part of historical understanding, and so massively flawed here.Previous games (that had a religion system) gave you a small bonus for founding it, and later maybe a slightly better one for doing more with it.Civ 6 turns this all into a whole sub section of the game where you now have to manage units and conflict just like you do with armies. You need offensive and defensive units for the inevitable holy wars, but your normal units aren't going to be terribly effective because shortly after finding another full Civ, they will flood you with their missionaries and apostles in a concentrated effort to wipe out yor beliefs. You know, that thing you founded to get you a still minor bonus.So unless you ignore your armies, you likely will not have enough of your own inquisitors to eliminate their religious invasions (and if you do ignore armies to do this, you invite actual invasion).And religion is a victory condition of the game. So it's sacrifice your cities to army invasions and lose the game to a Domination Victory or sacrifice your hard founded religion and losae the game to a Religious Victory.Turning off Religious Victory conditions don't help either. They still flood you with missionaries.Things they left in from the previous game?-- The ability of the AI to out produce you at every turn,-- The seeming clairvoyant ability of the AI to know exactly what Wonders you are building and beating you to them by 2 or 3 turns. Just close enough that you wasted 99% of the build time. Civ 5 was so notorious for this they made an achievement, so Civ 6 thinks this is a good thing.-- The fact the AI places their cities far too close to each other, so if you do conquer them, you have to raze every third city to prevent cities from arguing over valuable space, even more valuable given the level of zone planning you have to do now....OH! Yeah. razing cities leads to another new aspect. Warmongering.If you get too agressive, the AI gets mad and gangs up on you. Agressive, you know, taking a city state, or even declaring war on someone because they attacked an ally of yours. It's another case of the AI not having to follow the same rules as the player. They can declare war all they want (and they do) with no repercussions from the other AI, but YOU can't."

A ""feature"" of the game where spy’s are able to steal gold has ruined the experience for me. I went from making over 250 gold per turn to being bankrupt in less than 10 turns. The negative gold is not shown and can be prepared for. You are not even able to defend against it as your spies get disbanded for having negative gold.

The diplomacy has no depth to it, and often times the other civs hate you for no reason or for the dumbest reason imaginable. There are also a lot of bugs and the game crashes/desyncs alot. This game has a long way to go before it's any good. Do NOT spend 60 dollars on this. Wait for a game of the year edition that comes with the ridiculous amounts of DLC. Buy it for 10 dollars.

52,16.8,Recommended," June 28, 2017",3,"I have seen many people review this game as more of a negative experience to which I believe is irrationally unfair and uncanny.So here is my attempt at a fairly decent but unbiased review.Sid Meier's offers users to experience a simulation of the 'perfect' world they want to create, whether you're a warmonger or pacifist no one is to judge (apart from the computer telling you how 'wrong' your government is). Coming from a Civ background I have experienced change in the game which was needed to enhance its development. There are some games similar to Civ but none that really compete in similarity; Age of Empires, Cities: Skylines, Football Manager.Judging a game because it 'crashes all the time', or 'is to slow paced', have work arounds to these issues and the variety at which you can visually change your game is amazing, from a layout perspective I love to use Pangea or a water based Earth. That is just the beginning, there are hundreds if not thousands of randomly generated maps to which you can choose the pace of your game or duration, from slow to incredibly fast where you will research sciences quickly, this is entirely up to the player and their style of game.Admittedly at a certain point where the game might not have long left or if you're going for a particular style of victory, the game, sometimes can feel boring or prolonged which I understand for some, but knowing that this specific game requires dedication and can be time consuming, why would you even buy a game like this knowing its game duration? It's about perseverance and determination to finish what you started.Civilization VI is essentially a different category of game in its raw form, no it’s not an FPS shooter or Racing game, and is one of the more niche markets where it won’t sell millions and millions of copies which I think Firaxis understand.The game is fun and the negative reviews are just taking a dig at some really unnecessary points which is unfair. The game is fun in my opinion, I think purchasing it and playing for maybe an hour or two will really give the player an idea if it's a game for them."

117,66.1,Recommended," November 2, 2016",3,"I've been playing Civ games since Civ II.Each game in the series, despite the core elements, is a vastly different experience. For me, Civ V was extremely simple - effortless, really. This one is completely different. While some elements are greatly ""streamlined"" (and in turn, slightly more complicated for the established Civ player), they are designed well. The removal of Global Hapiness is welcome in my opinion. The districts and non-automated improvements make you put more thought into city placement and development. I'm not sure about the resource requirements for units - it's easier, maybe just too easy at some cases. Also, the sparsity of critical resourses, like iron, coal and such makes resource wars a more common occurance than in previous installments.The Graphics are great! Most games nowadays have a very... gritty aesthetic to them. Civilization VI, with it's nice, more artistic style, vibrant color scheme and, in my opinion, light-hearted visuals is a soothing escape from modern AAA titles with ZitVision 2k and ToenailWorks HD engines. This aesthetic brings a... wishful and optimistic look to a game about conquering the world. The soundtrack this time around was so on-point that I've actually kept it on for as long as I've played. Don't get me wrong - Baba Yetu was great, but I just wasn't enjoying the soundtrack as much as this one.My main and only complaint, is the AI. Regardless of the difficulty, you simply do not have luxury of slowly building your empire from the start. The AI is hyper-aggressive from the start, the negotion AI is pretty hard to please (but can be fooled with not much effort). Despite the aggression, you can exploit the AI's inability to fully utilize their military in a logical manner. It's just a lot harder if you're a player that wants to play a non-militant leader.There are bugs here and there that cause a slight bit of frustration, but that's to be expected in the initial release.Compared to vanila versions of previous Civ games, this one is very well packaged with features. More civilization options would have been a welcome addition, but that's probably coming later on.Speaking of which, I have high hopes and a complete uncertainty as to what to expect from upcoming expansions to Civ VI. The expansions to Civ V were excellent and made an already incredible game that much more better.In conclusion, I had my initial doubts about all these new changes to the game. However, they turned out alright. Civilization VI is a very good follow-up to it's previous itterations. Although there are issues with the AI, I hope that it will be adressed with either an update or an expansion. If you are a Civ fan, you will most likely enjoy it. So far I've completed two playthroughs with Gorgo and enjoyed every single minute of the >30 hours I've put into it. From learning from my initial mistakes, to understanding advanced planning tactics, it's a great experience for fans of Civilization!"

96,395.1,Recommended," July 5, 2017",3,"With 278 hours logged so far, its time to review.Lets first get this out of the way: Is Civ VI better than Civ V?--> No. Which is to say, the comparison is invalid in my opinion. Civ VI is -different- from Civ V in enough ways that, for me, it is a matter of ""Which Civ do I feel like playing today?"" (The answer to which is somehow never ""Beyond Earth"", but that is a different matter entirely.Now for my biggest issue with Civ games in general, the an account below is specific to Civ VI, but the core issue has carried over throughout the different installments:--> War mongering penalties (and AI behaviour in general).This is quite possibly down to my personal playstyle, but to me the AI always ends up a sulky child.My average game of civ progresses something like this:Found city --> Rapid expansion, ideally limiting the expansion capacity of 1 or more opponents. --> ""Boxed in"" opponent warns about settling too close; ignore. --> Boxed in opponent requests friendship once, twice, even three times perhaps. --> Meet other AI opponents who are happy to send delegations and act all friendly, until about 5 turns later they denounce me because I have selected a different government / I had a religious unit spread religion in their city a single time. As long as I maintain a different government / for the rest of the 6000 years spanning game just because I used a religious unit one time in their territory, these AI opponents denounce me whenever their denuciation has run out. Meanwhile --> Boxed in opponent, with declaration of friendship, declares a surprise war on me. --> Invariably, the agressor fails at every attempt to claim territory and is steadily forced out of my lands.At this point, the warmonger penalty I have incurred already exceeds that of the agressor who came to occupy my land, but, I am intent on showing this agressor the error of their ways and so I refuse their peace offerings, simply because paying me a bit of gold for 30 turns is not going to stop them from trying again later. So I push on (game progress continues)--> I pursue the agressor onto his territory and generally do not consider stopping my advance until I have claimed one of their cities (or razed it and rebuilt my own city in its place), and they are willing to cede that city and relinquish control of another city in exchange for peace. --> From this point forward all AI opponents, for the rest of the game, keep me in a continuous state of denuciation, save for the spare few turns during which they wish to make unreasonable trade offers or demands. --> Some further wars may be declared, I may or may not conquer further territory, I have not as yet sought a religious victory (mainly because a faith based economy is a tedious thing to manage in my opinion) --> Ultimately the game ends, usually with a victory for me, most commonly a science victory (although the above is also an exact representation of a cultural victory with Kongo against Russia, USA and Spain and also applies to domination victories, but the warmongering there is obvious).First issue with the above put briefly: It is a bit like the entire world holding a grudge against Greece because of Alexander the Great, or against Mongolia for Ghengis Khan. It is absolutely absurd that a war in the BC era is cause for agression in 1736 AD.Second issue: If they remember the ""attrocities I committed"" so well, why are they all so intent on antagonising me? Especially the AI that I so ""mercilessly"" defended myself against should know better than to give me attitude after what I did when they tried to invade me.So, the primary ""Con"" which overshadows overal gameplay for me, is one that has been an issue in Civ for several installments now: Warmongering / AI political tactics.PRO's:City building: Almost everyone mentions this, so read another review.Warfare: Combat strategy has always been vital in Civ, but since Civ V brought back the 1 unit per tile mechanics while swapping to hexagons, combat strategy has improved incredibly. The addition in Civ VI, support units, adds an interesting layer to this. Although I am not personally that big a fan of them, I do feel they provide a valuable contribution to the overal depth of warfare.Religious units: Tying in with support units mentioned above, Apostles are a very interesting unit, their capacity to assist military, cultural and religious efforts requires a little further distinction (such as the ability to choose rather than it being luck-based in terms of which promotion options you're offered) but all the components are there.Map view: Tying in with the way city building is organised in Civ V, you now get beautiful vistas of your cities, its builder-made improvements and the various wonders and districts (and district buildings) they contain. The ""exploration age"" design of unexplored areas of the map, and the cartographic look of the 'fog of war' keep the map view interesting.""Other"" Cons:Apart from my extensive rant about War Monger Penalties and AI behaviour in general, there are several interface issues I would really like to see resolvedThese mostly relate to User Interface issues:- City/Encampment attacks from garrisoned tiles: When I have a unit on a city the unit icon overlaps with the city attack icon, they shift apart when moving the map, problem with that is that clicking on the city attack icon centres the map back on the city, while it may not actually activate the city ranged attack, causing me to sometimes move the map 5 times to be able to click on the city attack icon, only to have the camera moved back without the city ranged attack being activated. It also regularly causes the wrong attack to hit an agressors (where the city attack can kill one unit but not another, and the garrisoned ranged unit can kill the other or overkill the first for example). My main issue however is with the map shifting to be able to click a button.- Auto unit cycle: For some reason, when I deactivate this and click on ""a unit needs orders"" it cycles through my units in a fairly sensible order, 'grouped' military units one after the other, to then move across the map. On auto cycle sadly it shifts between units completely randomly, so trying to quickly set 5 units to attack a city causes 2 to attack, the 3rd to receive an order to walk halfway across the map and the last 2 to ..do nothing until I've moved an apostle or builder that is absolutely irrelevent to ongoing events..!I'm out of text space, so I hope this is helpful. All in all Civ VI is still a great game and definitely in my top 2 favourites in the series. Don't think of it as replacing Civ V, think of it as a different way to play Civ with significant similarities to Civ V."
73,687.7,Recommended," June 28, 2017",3,"A lot of these reviews are being too hard on this game. They almost discouraged me from buying, but I'm happy I did anyway. I've played the whole Civilization legacy, and I think this is the same game I've always been playing but with tons of little tweaks and additions that will make you go ""oh wow, thats a really cool thing they added"".Quick list of pros:1 Combining units into corps. and armies. I think its a cool dynamic to building up your forces and making it possible for older era units to stand up to more advanced ones. Within reason. A single tank is still going to obliterate dozens of archers.2 Building districts which can specialize your cities building options and functions. Very nice addition.3 Culture and tech tree advancement is much better and dynamic, with goal oriented bonus advancements to every tech and policy.4 CITY STATES ARE FINALLY USEFUL You can buy them as a temp army and the bonus leverage they provide is competetive to aquire. Im happy they got this right.5 Workers having charges and more engaged use, rather than just automatically improving everything constantly.The AI isn't as bad as people make it sound. The personalities are determined by a public agenda, and one hidden that you only learn about if you become friendly. Its not hard to figure out how to make some happy, and its silly to think you can be on everyones good side. For instance, if a leader just really wants to build wonders, they will get mad and declare war when you build wonders. If a leader is warlike, they will like you if you have a big army and cause lots of wars. I will admit the AI is somewhat random at times, and you can consider the motivations to be a throwback to historical wars over stupid things. Yes they will sometimes declare war suddenly, but its usually because they were coerced by another leader. Sometimes they declare war and wont launch any attacks, or sometimes they will have an army ready to attack. Trading is a little more negotiable as sometimes they will lowball the hell out of you and you can barter for more. If you are unfriendly don't expect any good deal ever.Some minor complaints:1 Amenities. Which are points held by each city based off your luxury resources, but I dont understand how exactly they work or how they are distributed. They reduce production significant if you dont have enough. The game will remind you every damn turn when you dont have enough, and the debuff applies to random cities it seems.2 Still no ability to save game setup options, or a regenerate map if you are unhappy with the starting spot.3 Religion needs to be able to be turned off. Religious victory is pretty dumb, and when it matters to an AI you will just get bombarded by converters which can block your units. However, it is kind of cool they that these units can fight each other without formally declaring war. Too many leader perks rely on faith points and religious structures.4 Leaders are kinda lame imo and the perks are a little unbalanced. Recommend mods for new leaders. I need more Stalin in my life.Altogether I'm happy with this game. I think this stands up to 4 as the best civ."
67,110.3,Recommended," October 29, 2016",3,"After playing over a hundred hours of Civ 6, I am still going to leave my positive review up in hopes the Civ team gives their game more attention. Unfortunately, I have to retract my optimism that the game's AI mechanics will be balanced. Before I delve anymore into this review, I want to highlight everything Civ 6 does right:Districts are a wonderful idea and add a whole new layer of strategy to the game. City-building feels much more satisfying and wonderful than in Civ 5.Builders in replacement of workers is also a welcome change. Having 10 builders just sitting doing nothing but building roads in Civ 5 end game felt horribly wasteful and tedious to manage.Wonders are actually visible on your city now! In all my 100 hours of playing I have never--not once--skipped the little wonder movie that plays after you've completed one.I'm still a bit divided on the science/culture tree changes (can't tell if Eureka's add or retract strategy from the game) but I think it is an overall improvement from Civ 5's odd-to-manage culture system. I also have no complaints against the graphic changes in Civ 6. I've grown fond of the simpler, more exuberant art style.So why has the game received such negative reviews?Truthfully, if the AI was just as it were in Civ 5, then this game would surely be showered with all the praise that Civ 5 received. Unfortunately, the AI is broken down to its core. I no longer believe that it can be fixed with simple tweaking, and I don't think the Civ 6 team has the energy to fix it. Let me give you an example of what I mean:I begin a game as Russia. Gandhi and the Aztecs are nearby.The Aztecs and Gandhi aren't too happy with each other.I am on good terms with Gandhi.Gandhi offers to declare a joint war on the Aztecs.Hopeful to knock out the Aztecs early, I agree.The next turn Gandhi denounces me for warmongering.That right there is game breaking. Early game and late game strategies often get thrown out the window because the AI, no matter how much you strategize yourself to achieve favorable relations with them, will almost always turn their backs and denounce you for little to no reason.I was once denounced by Norway for not having a strong Navy on TURN 10!Buy when on sale if you are a Civ fan. There are enough new features that you can still enjoy the first few games before you are eventually fed up with the AI."
36,28.2,Not Recommended," February 10, 2017",3,"EDIT2: Yep, this game is confirmed a waste of money. AI declare war on you without provocation, I had 5 different civs attack me at once (Within the first 5 turns of the game, mind you) for simply being peaceful. Naval units are the most useless things I've ever used in a civ game. AIs over-extend far too much, often having more than 10 cities in the first hundred or so turns. If you're looking for a good civ game, go play civ 5 or 4. They're MUCH better than this abomination.EDIT: Yes I realize i only have 20 hours in this game but my review will explain why.Having played 600+ hours on Civ V and hopping over to VI a few weeks after it came out, I am underwhelmed. The AI is poorly made, There is no build queue, You weren't even able to rename your cities when it first came out. They ALREADY HAVE DLC. What a horrible way to kick off a game.I can only honestly recommend this game if you play with friends and ONLY with friends. Unless of course you're sadistic and you play against the easy-as-pie Deity AI then go right ahead and do that.But in all seriousness I simply cannot recommend this game in its current state... at least not until it's fixed up and has an actual workshop. I know I have basically been repeating the same stuff as all the other reviews so let me add something of my own.A major problem (in my opinion) with this game is the fact that multiplayer is STILL broken. It was broken in Civ V and now it is broken again. Whenever there is a turn timer and someone disconnects, the game freezes up and does not let the turns progress. HUGE oversight with both games that I feel needs to be addressed.PROS:The district system is very well-done. It adds an extra depth to the game that the others didn't. Good job on that regard, Firaxis.The trade route system. The fact that roads are built as a result of having a trade caravan is a good addition in my opinion.Loading times. YES PLEASE. The loading times have been SIGNIFICANTLY reduced in this installment of the Civ franchise. Instead of waiting 20 minutes for the game to load and another 10 to load up a map like in Civ V, it now takes a minute or two to load the game AND the map combined. Well done.All in all, go buy Civ V with all the DLC if you want to have a good time. Don't play Civ VI unless you're a masochist or something. AI is garbage, multiplayer is broken, there is no build queue, there is already DLC. This is a sad excuse for a Civ game, to say the very least."
160,92.4,Not Recommended," June 26, 2017",3,"After 92 hours of gameplay already I am let say distraught on how the devs made this. Feels like a waste of time and a waste of a perfectly good game. Civ 5 I clocked over 500 hours into thanks to excellent AI and units. Civ 6 has numerous problems with its AI... constant suprise wars for no reason whatsoever and if you start a war all the more reason for more wars to be declared onto you, theres no leyway no halfway mark it will JUST HAPPEN even if you were friends with them.I understand the difficulty but this is ridiculous they wont start wars on themselves to start with through to the medival age (if you even get that far), you get double teammed on so you take attacks from both sides (im not saying thats a flaw thats a clever tactic), but to me this has happened every single game ive played no change when I change the options in players difficulty, random maps and resources, you will get hit straight away making starts on classic age and up all the more impossible.Other AI issues invovle that they lack the ability to level up their units. When I have helicopters and battleships the AI with have crossbows, spearmen etc etc. Almost as if they have no balance when to building cities and place themselves anywhere, this then ♥♥♥♥♥ on the challenge for late gameplay and you go around knocking out cities and units that I havnt used that unit for in at least 2000 years.For a game that was released back in late 2016 and civ 5 was released 2014 makes you wish beyond earth never existed (and lets be honest it might as well not have) so they would put their resources and time into making a better civ 6. I would love to recommend this as im a massive fan of the series I love their concept and idea and most of civ 6 new concepts are a massive improvement to civ 5 making everything simpler but for good reasons and spreading out your districts for a better producing city, but this has started to becoming a burden of simplistic AI and poor gameplay im going to have put this one down. Will possibly change review if devs start listening to the player base for once however at this moment in time nothing has changed and the patches released just keep polishing a turd. Shame."

340,47.5,Recommended," October 24, 2016",3,"TL;DRIn a short summary, this is an excellent game crippled by AI, which will still be very enjoyable, especially with friends.Full review(pros and cons further down)SummaryThe game has the potential to be the best in the series, it has various new mechanics, the visuals are refreshing for the series, and replayability is amazing. Although probably the only ""major"" so to speak problem would be the AI and how it behaves.On the matters of A.I.In the current state of the game, playing against AI is somewhere between boring and annoying.The problems the AI seem to have are the following:Another problem that is more evident in higher and lower difficulties is the unbalanced tech tree.An AI on king difficultyIn addition, the tree seems like it has multiple weird spots, such as archery not leading to anything, meaning you avoid it, fearing a waste of turns. Worse even is the top line of the tech tree, starting with sailing, which leads to compters without any intervention from the other tech lines.The UI is largely find and polished, namely the main menu being one of my favorites in gaming history (gotta love some christopher tin music), although it has some shortcomings, such as very small X buttons to exit diplomacy screens, and the auto unit-rotate feature which has caused me to waste so many movements.Players of previous civ games will know that the mid game has been nutoriously stale.Fortunately, in civ 6 this is mostly not the case, if you can build your cities properly, production wise.The game is mostly fine, although some people seem to report crashes on load, loads hanging and such, but those being pretty rare, it's not a real worry.The music for the game, composed by Christopher Tin is absolutely stellar.Some people have compared it to Baba Yetu, which won a grammy. I am one of those.is in my opinion the best main theme civ had. ever.The music for each civilization also evolves through the eras, having a very basic tune in the ancient era, and all the way to the information era, where the core melody (such as a banjo for america) remains, but has many layers added to it.Civ 6 has a very strong lineup of features and is generally very enjoyable, but due to a very annoying fault with the AI, it is somewhat problematic."
130,62.5,Recommended," November 24, 2016",3,"The District Mechanic adds some strategic element when settling cities, although its impacts are a bit obscure and need people to read either in-game encyclopaedia (which does not contain all info at times and/or has faulty entries in some details) or read/watch tutorials on-line. This is important as your cities grow and you realize you waisted Builder action on a tile that now will be removed by the district. Also very important is that once you start a district you cant cancel it and worse you cant remove it, so make sure you hit the right tile. The planing ahead should also not be exclusive to existing bonuses, looking at tiles and plan what improvements go where and thus what districts go adjacent in future, to maximise city outputs.Combat is still pretty much the same as in Civ V, which is OK I guess, with the corps/armadas mechanic that I think is not really that great tbh. Coming from EU4, I feel combat could be improved quite a bit, for example allow the creation of armies, where you can add units of various types to it.The last bit I need to mention is this rather lengthy ramble, is diplomacy. Yes they added a few ticks that are nice, but diplomacy is just as moronic as ever. There is no sense to interaction for most part and it does not help that AI actions do not reflect diplomacy information AT ALL! For example, in a game with 6 other civs, the 2 civs that were FRIENDLY! Surprise DoWed me BOTH (in different times, maybe 20-30 turns apart). What gives?Great people system is pretty good, I like this approach, but the Writers, Musicians and Artists really need to be looked at, its silly that I cant keep up with building places to store stuff these people create and that they are otherwise just useless. There should be a way to activate the person and get a % boost to cultures or a one time boost to specific wonders, like with some engineers, or even just whatever amount of culture, like scientist. In one game I had to sell great works to make use of the writers, and even that capped as they only ever buy one and only if they dont have one yet (at least thats what I gathered)."
147,55.7,Recommended," January 23, 2017",3,"I love Civilzation games, but Civ 6 still needs more work. Work on A.I., mod support (PLEASE), and many other little things that make the game sometimes a drag and sort of grindy. Overall a good game though, just wished it had come out alittle later when all these little nuisances could of probably been worked out and made this game as great as Civ 5."
228,393.2,Recommended," November 28, 2016",3,"The latest version of Civilization is much like its predecessors - not perfect by any means, but still a great game, and a prime example of the 4X strategy genre. And I fully expect that it will only get better as more content is released, just like the previous versions. I fully recommend it for anyone looking for a good grand strategy game.Like most sequels, this one is at once familiar and different, so I'll focus on the changes from previous versions. On the whole, I find the game more enjoyable and there are more options to pursue tha in Civ V. I like the added strategic and thematic options that have been introduced, and generally consider the new features to be improvements. The big problem right now is that the AI struggles to provide a significant challenge for experienced players, perhaps because it hasn't learned how best to navigate the variety of significant new strategic options. Since Civ will always be primarily a single-player game, this is a significant issue, although the game remains entertaining nonetheless.The district system is probably the biggest and most obvious change, shifting the vast majority of buildings into specialized tiles and forcing a number of new strategic decisions on the player. The choice of which districts a city builds influences how the city develops, determining which buildings it can build and what types of Great People it will contribute towards, making long term planning more important since the number of districts a city can build is limited by population. Now each city will have its own unique mix of builidngs, as opposed to mostly being a copy of all your other cities. I've seen a number of opinions on the change, but personally, I like the added strategic layers the district system provides, from planning your own development in peace time to increasing the impact of raiding forces during war, since most buildings can be damaged and disabled by attacking or looting the district that houses them.Another major change is splitting the tech tree into two halves - a traditional tech tree with progress based on research and a separate civics tree where progress is instead based on culture. The tech tree unlocks buildings and units, while the civics tree unlocks diplomatic, trade, and governmental choices (mostly in the form of new policy options you can employ which let you boost specific abilities of your civ according to the needs of the moment), with Wonders split amongst the two. Additionally, both types of research can be sped significantly through achievements your civ reaches, such as building particular units or taking specific actions related to a tech or civic. Overall, I again feel the changes are positive, enabling an empire that struggles to keep up in one area to compensate by excelling in another. The boosts do tend to accelerate the speed of progress overall, since you can cut research time in half by meeting the boosting criteria, so usually the various eras are reached long before the time period they represented historically. But they do give the player another set of minigoals to focus their efforts on.The last major change is a dramatic increase in the importance of location to a wide variety of things. Districts gain boosts based on the terrain and development of tiles around them, making them more effective if properly placed. Each Wonder has a terrain-based unlock criteria in addition to the tech/civic based one, making it impossible to just build a single mega-city that racks up production and builds most of the world's Wonders based on its output alone. Again, this increases challenge and strategic options, since your plans are more closely tied to the details of the spaecific play-through. It also allows players to remain competitive for Wonders even if they aren't on the cutting edge of research, since opponents may not be able to start work on a project until long after they unlock the relevant tech.As in previous versions (and in most other 4X strategy games), the weak link is the AI. Harder difficulties are mostly just added starting resources and discounts on AI costs for all activities. The challenge of a new difficulty level is heavily front-loaded as a result - if you can survive an initial rush by AI civs fueled initial advantage in units, the game is only slightly harder at higher difficulties. The AI also seems less aggressive than in previous versions, and as long as you maintain a reasonable defensive force and aren't deliberately provocative, you can often go multiple eras without a war, much less a challenging one. The wars that do happen (whether or not they involve a human player) tend to be settled quickly and (in the case of AI vs. AI wars) indecisively. Once the balance tips towards one side, the other quickly offers peace on generous terms, knowing it probably can't rebuild it's army quickly enough to recover. If one side has managed to take an established city or two, this often means the AI will offer the majority of its available resources and an extra city or two, in addition to giving up its claims on the conquered territory.Improvements are needed in the AI's focus on achieving victory conditions, as well. It is often impossible to determine what type of victory an AI civ is pursuing, unless that strategy is being very successful. At higher difficulties, at least, each civ ought to be attempting at least one type of victory, ideally changing plans if another path seems easier while still remaining committed enough to not paralyze itself by constantly switching course. But in most games it does not appear that most of the civs are actually trying to win at all, instead sitting in a largely passive clump of medicority in all facets while one or two more successful civs push for the win. Often no AI is attempting one or more of the victory types (for instance, I've never seen an AI civ make an obvious attempt at a domination (military) victory). It would be much more challenging if these issues could be overcome and the AI would provide a more significant challenge in the late game.But despite these concerns, this is still an excellent game, and highly enjoyable for both new and experienced players."
907,0.5,Not Recommended, March 9,3,"Civ 2 was one of my most played games. I loved Civ 1 as well. I lost touch with the series after that.That said... the soul of Civilization seems to have been lost too. It has followed the path of large development studios that make pretty things because pretty things sell, but don't give a damn about producing mechanics that make any sense.There's all these Sean Bean voiceovers. They soon grow tiresome. I don't need everything reading to me, thanks. Meanwhile the tutorial is obnoxiously long winded with endless repetition.So I quit the tutorial after a few minutes despite being none-the-wiser on how to play. I start out as Vikings. I fiddle about with some things using the rather unintuitive UI, mostly guessing based on my past experience but seeing qutie a bit of additional complexity. I move some units near the coast. They get fired at by archers over the English Channel - y'know, that 30km sea between the UK and Europe. Oh, and over mountains too. What the ... ?I immediatelly stopped at that point. I'm not going to bother investing time learning all the crazy complexities of a game (and it throws so many numbers at you, way more than the originals, and the UI is awful with the City management dialog compressed into the corner of the screen) if they can't even design something so fundamentally simple to make sense.I'd have refunded it if I could (I got it as part of a bundle, unfortunately)."

174,179.5,Not Recommended," March 21, 2017",3,"Would love to give this game a positive review, but... Two things.1. Every playthrough eventually hits a point where for one absurd reason or another, all opposing AI factions declare war on you. Ignoring the improvements to the AI's combat effectiveness (slight, but there), this effectively destroys any sense of realistic dimplomacy, and causes the game to become little more than a steamrolling of your troops one by one over the enemy cities, or else vice-versa.2. I payed for the delux edition. Turns out, if I had instead simply bought each worthwhile DLC pack individually, I would have saved five bucks, and could have avoided getting the pathetic viking senario, to which modders have done better variations of. Just saying, feels like a bit of a #%$^ slap to me."

Its very very very pretty, and a true joy to play....But the design choices are just so insane.....I cant even comprehend why they would make them. The art style by itself is a turn off for me, but I can excuse it on the grounds of being unique, but The government system works using playing cards now... it feels like im playing Yuh-Ghi-Oh not Civililization ""OH you attacked me, Now I activate my Fascism third alternative card that gives me a + 1 production to all my Militiary units"" They have completely removed happiness as a mechanic, which makes it realllly easy to just absolutely steamroll the A.I. YOu declare war on the guy next to you , you conquer him use his cities to pump out more units and repeat, boom you have your entire continent before the mideval era, which means all you have to do is refocus science in all your cities, and you have nuclear submarines by the 1300s, Even on the hardest difficulty you can do this. The difficulty levels just make the AI troops stronger not smarter. The The art style makes it very difficult to distingush ceratin terrain features. The Female advisor voice actor sounds like she swallowed a razor blade. The british male voice actor is nice but he sounds Waaaaaaay too enthusiastic, They obviously can't top having lenard Nimoy in CIv IV but they could deffinitly have someone better. The Quotes they Choose are just simply, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. theres no nicer way to put it, I constently find my self asking ""who the hell is that?"" everytime I unlock a tech level, or a civic level. Something I am personally offended by is the fact that the developers said that the world congress wouldnt ship with the base game , becuase they wanted to see how the meta game played out. Well as fans of the game know, no world congress means no reason to explore the world, not to metion this means that they where already developing (what I can only assume to be a paid DLC) before the game even released. Also Why is Gilgamesh a Civ Leader? HE is a fictional charachter, you might as well have King Arthur as a Civ Leader. When you discover satilites and reveal the entire map, it still does that annoying parchment art style map that acts as kind of a fog of war....thats like...just no....why would you do that? I have a satilite in geosynchronus orbit over an enemy nation so My top scientists draw the map on a peice of parchment. The game self censors its violence with these reeally cartoony star pops, it remids me of the 1960's batman televison show.The game has potential. it really does but is it worth $60 in its current state, no no its not"

32,64.3,Not Recommended," November 9, 2017",3,"Civ VI's failure: The Two Salems(This review contains religious references, but is addressing a failure of the game, not initiating a debate on the subject)Civ VI has unfortunately joined the pantheon of other games which are simultaneously overtweaked and underdeveloped (Read Master of Orion 3+). But in having a selective view of historical fact, it demonstrates its ability to faor AI players over human players.Case in point, and the reason for the title of this review, is that two Salems, and several other historical events of a similar vein, is the inability to kill Missionaries with forces defending cities. 2000 years ago, soldiers were involved the removal of a key religous figure in one ""Salem"". Nearly 1700 years later, another ""Salem"" was at the center of another ""religious persecution"" at the hands of forces. There are more examples throughout written history, but apparentlly not where Civ VI's designers want the game to go, since you can't send city defenders after missionairies in the game.This is just one of a list of flaws with the game, but in short, if I could get my money back on this game, I would. Civ VI is a basic Civ 3 with an updated GUI."
7,435.3,Not Recommended," December 12, 2017",7,"The game is highly unplayable for any length of time. There are just too many show-stopper bugs that are simply not being addressed.* ""Balanced"" start position is not balanced.* Barbarians are hopelessly overpowering in the early game.* Start positioning was broken completely with the Fall ""patch"", so you have to start 20-30 games just to get one that has a reasonable position for your capital.* The fog of war is terrible. They use the same colors for both currently not visible terrain and never-visited terrain.* The icons for visted terrains with resources are all brown, rather than having at least the shading of the resource colors.* In single-player mode, the game focuses on defeating the human far too much. Barbarians will bypass other civ or city-state units just to attack the human, even if it should be obvious that they need to attack the AI.* Many options in the game were present in Civ V, but completely missing from VI. How do I turn off spying? You don't. How do I turn off barbarians, or make them tougher? You don't. How do you get the game to use a new random seed if you go back to a saved game? You don't. All of these and many more were in Civ V, but are not in VI. How can a game ""upgrade"" forget important features from previous versions?* And many more.Most of all, they seem to be completely oblivious to the major issues they have. They need to have a feedback mechanism that works. If only I could get some kind of response that says they realize how bad they did and want to make it better. But, they don't seem to care about their players, beyond advertising the next expansion.There are a lot of really cool features (like eurekas, builders, districts, and more). But, not nearly enough to make up for the horrible gaffs.Overall the game is not very good at all. Unless they make fixes (BEFORE the expansion), I will avoid buying more product from them completely. I'm not about to pay for them to fix their bugs."

314,82.2,Not Recommended, February 12,3,"Yikes what a let down.They had alot of live up to compared to Civ V and I actually think they made alot of REALLY good moves. Many of the new mechanics, if explained in theory, make the game sound very exciting but in practice they just don't do anything for the game. Its so hard to put your finger on why when I played Civ V I could easily get lost in the game feeling like a fearless tyrant at the head of a great warmachine or a bonevolant diplomat engineering world peace. I just cant get there with Civ VI.First off, The AI is VERY dumb.Example, The year was ~1800, Greece had been a friend of mine for about 700 years, They were on some far away island I rarely interacted with. They suddenly they wage war on me. A few turns go by and a lone greek spearman shows up on my shore, I bombard him from my city and easily kill him. Greece sues for peace and gives me all their GPT and gems for 30 turns and go back to loving me... Like seriously wtf?The Districts are a neat way to spread out your city but they just feel like a chore to build and god forbid a rogue barbarian raids your district and you have to wait 300 years in game time to repair it.The religeon has a combat system now and I was insanely excited at first to become a pious pope type and wage a holy war sending wave after wave of missionaries to far awar lands until you're finally the dominant religeon on earth and you realize literally all that effort awards you pretty much nothing... How can they have such cool ideas and let them fall so flat?If you're winning this game is just clicking through your turns bored and if somehow you are losing it never feels like you've been out maneuvered, its usually just because the inexlicapley stupid AI all decided to declare on your at the same time for no apperant reason or gods of RNG have placed you in some barbarous anarchy nation.I keep reminding myself that Civ VI took two xpacs to get truly awesome so I wait... I sincerely hope I can come back and change my review."

40,11.6,Not Recommended," November 20, 2016",3,"Update:I had another go. This game still disappoints me.The biggest let down for me is that the Civilization franchise still hasn't figured out how to make the computer players (I refuse to call them AI - there's nothing intelligent about them) enrich the game. There are three HUGE problems for me:1. Civilization computer players suck. They always have and now I'm convinced they always will. When you increase the difficulty of this game, the computer players get more starting units, combat modifiers, research modifiers etc. That's not making the computer players more competitive. That's allowing the computer to cheat. It's the easy way out and worse, it means all those stupid decisions the computer players make on easier settings are made on the more difficult settings.2. Immersiveness went out the window in Civ V and hasn't returned for Civ VI. Specifically, the computer players are unashamedly ""players"" - they're not leaders of civilizations. When I saw in Civ V that Caesar didn't like me because ""They think you're trying to win the game the same way they are"" I face palmed so hard my brain rattled. I mean- WHAT? I don't want that! Who wants that? If I want to play Civ with friends, I will do so. Incidentally, I don't. For me, Civ isn't a multiplayer game. I don't want to play a game. I want to rule the world!!!In Civ VI you can give a player tribute to learn more about them. I shouldn't be able to know about their style of play. Stop reminding me that I am playing a game.In this sitting of Civ VI, Qin Shi Huang denounced me for ""Having more wonders than they do""... I HAVE ONE WONDER! IT'S 300AD AND I HAVE BUILT ONE WONDER!!!!! Within one turn of that wonder being built, I was denounced. That's not intelligence. It makes for an absolutely miserable game. Which brings me onto the next problem...3. The computer players have absolutely no context to their decision making. In my game, I have never declared war on anyone. Three times, I have had other ""players"" (because I'm not dealing with countries or leaders here) declare war on me. The first time, I took one city from the offender. They denounced me ever since. The second time, I wiped that same offender out, because lets face it, they were going to keep declaring war on me. I took one city from the other player who declared war at the same time. An unrelated player now denounces me for being a war monger (yet I have started no wars) and the offending player, who confirmed I could have the city I already took as part of a peace deal, constantly denounces me for having that city. It's like the makers of the game don't want you to go to war, to take cities, TO PLAY THE GAME.As for trade - it's not trade. It's robbery. No matter how much a computer player is struggling in this game, don't expect them to trade fairly with you. No. A common theme in Civilization games is: Nobody wants to trade with you.There are so many games out there which push the envelope on visual effects. The Civilization franchise is so well placed to do the same for AI. Every time, they let the players down.Orginal:I am an avid fan of the Civilization series; I have played every PC Civilization game since Civ II. When I have that itch to play a game but not quite sure which, Civilization is always the scratch. Until now. This is, by a long long way, the worst Civilization game I have ever played. Thankfully I paid £30 on a discount site for this disappointment rather than the £50 price tag on Steam.""Just one more turn"" is a phrase typically used to describe how difficult it is to put a Civ franchise game down. It is equally apt to describe just how painful it is to plod on in Civ VI - I'm really having to spur myself on to give this game a chance to bite. After a second sitting, I have decided Civ VI has no teeth.Civilization games have been on a steady decline. It was the little things which made Civ II so great - the progressive throne room, the responsive city views, the entertaining live action advisors, the humourous player name victory titles. I miss those features. I now have a single boring advisor who really isn't telling me very much of use. I spend fifteen minutes at a time hitting ""end turn"" without actually doing anything. I've spent a millenium surrounded by four countries and not had cause to speak with them after the obligatory introduction. I am bored.Rather than ""little things"" making a great game, there are ""little things"" which make this game frustrating to play. I can't quite put my finger on it; I have a large screen, yet I feel like I can hardly see anything. I don't know if it's something funky with the cartoony graphics, or that the various helper panels take up too much room (they're not really that big) but I feel like I can't zoom out to a level to see enough of what's going on without being too zoomed out. I end up edge scrolling a lot.And that brings me onto the next problem. I always use edge of screen scrolling in Civ games - it's the intuitive way to see what's to the left, what's to the right etc. In this game, it's switched off by default. Why would you do that? Doesn't matter - at least I can switch it on. Unfortunately, the edge scrolling has been implemented / signed off by a plonker. Here's the simple requirement: ""When I move my mouse cursor to the edge of my screen, move the playing window in that direction. Stop when I bring the cursor back into the playing area."" That's all it needs to do. Simple. Already implemented in CIV V. But it doesn't work like that. Instead, they have implemented: ""When I move my mouse cursor to within an inch of the edge of the screen, start scrolling. Stop scrolling if I go to the edge of the screen. Don't scroll diagnonally if I go to the bottom right hand corner (presumably because their are buttons there?). Do scroll if I go to click one of the buttons at the top of the screen (WHAT????). I want to feel extreme mental anguish when I use edge scrolling.""Summary: Gameplay sucks. Graphics too cartoony in some aspects. Overpriced (ignore people who say this is reasonably priced - this is not an AAA game). I simply don't want to play this game and that's a shame because I loved previous installments. Goodbye Civ franchise. Let me know if you start caring about the little things again and stop pretending to be a top end graphics feast."
41,99.8,Not Recommended," August 2, 2017",3,"The only good thing about this game is how it looks. Its visuals, music and overall feel of the game are more than familiar, it’s gorgeous and that’s where my praises end.I’ve played Civilization since it came out, sometime in 1991 and have played all its iterations, including spin-offs (and its ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ cousins Call to Power and Alpha Centauri) on the PC and a few outside (PlayStation, N-Gage, Nintendo) its native platform. As the series promises, this is an enjoyable game up until you’re incessantly assaulted by the AI with Missionaries, Apostles, and Inquisitors. Never have I seen a more crippling usage of Religion in a game. Of course, there is a way to protect oneself from the AI’s rabid tactic but a few rounds after successfully defending yourself from the first wave of devout invaders; one quickly realizes you are doing nothing else. This aspect of the game blatantly robs gamers of the entire Civilization experience. Speaking of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ cousins, remember Civilization Call to Power? Remember that annoying little unit called the Lawyer, which attacks our cities with injunctions essentially halting its production? That was a game breaker, considering that it wasn’t all that gratifying to play to begin with. The exasperating trinity of Missionaries, Apostles and Inquisitors does the exact annoying thing.Civilization VI is a beautifully executed, aesthetically pleasing game that adds cool aspects like districts to the already awesome series but if fails miserably with the inclusion of draconian victory conditions for Religion.Hint: If Firaxis really wants religion as a victory condition, then an option for non-belief, science-based albeit secular philosophies should be included as well. A unit like “Agent of Reason” should be able to quell religious zealots effortlessly.

Why the downvote then? Well, at present status the game is just not worth its pricetag. Main problems are the subpar tactical AI and skirmish-like diplomacy system.Granted, AI and diplomacy are not a big deal if your goal is to play online. However, I only play singleplayer and the lack of development in these fields totally destroys a game for me. Tactically, the AI is unable to attack: it deploys a carpet of doom which doesn't even try to seize a city and then forgets to keep units up to date. Leaders seem to be bipolar and slaves of their agendas and seem unable to evaluate a military/political scenario. This is inexcusable, given that Firaxis was able to deploy a great diplomacy system years ago with SMAC.Honestly, I was expecting a bit more, for this price. While I'm able to forgive bad AI and diplomacy in a game like endless legend (which costs 1/3 of this), I can't do the same for a game developed from a company who used to set the standard with their products (and whose games are so pricey)."

I LOVE building wonders. But its not fun for me in Civ6.I really feel bad but I can't recommend this game. Maybe later if they add/change game concepts. I wonder if people will spend the time to mod it. Miss the mods from Civ5.Plus, if an enemy civ coverts your city to their religion, thats it. There is no hope of getting your original religion started again. In civ5 your holy city would eventually turn back to your own religion.Pros: Good graphics, good sound and narration. I love the animation when a wonder is built.Cons: see above and no mods yet.Take care,J."

But then you find out that all the extra ""options"" are just a disguise for more linear gameplay. In order to get ahead in the game, you can boost research by doing or building certain things, or have other things researched. All this makes that there really is only 1 way to do it right, and that is to follow the set linear development outlined by the research boosts.Furthermore, halfway down the game you are going to completely freak out about all the religious crap they put into the game. It's unbelievably frustrating to time on time again see all your religious units bite the dust in ""religious combat"". thats another way of saying: Absolutely 0 tactics required, just need to have more units then the other guy. Does the other guy have more units? I guess you're gona have to start over, play another 2 days untill you get to the exact same point, and then start over again.

13,77.9,Not Recommended," January 5, 2017",3,"After playing a few rounds of this game I've come to realise that Civ is a long dead franchise that is microwaved and re-served to the public for top dollar. There are really few changes from the previous iterations and considering how bad Beyond Earth was I would have hoped they would have made some real changes. The barbarians have way too many units and they seem to progress as fast as the top player/AI.Major dissapointment in the Culture sector in terms of a ""victory condition"". Conquest is the easiest (as usual) and requires little skill aside from having 10+ cities all pumping out attacking units and going straight for the closest enemy. Trying to build up the culture needed to win is nearly impossible. Add to the fact that the AI are just simply better than you at it even on lower difficulties. This game tries way too hard to please everyone and instead spreads everything out.Policies are annoying to say the least. You get 50 policies and you have to stop and read each and every one of them every time a spot opens up. Making it tediously boring for the long game when you have to think which type of victory you want. Only to realise on the next turn that you wasted your wildcard spots on culture only to be denounced and invaded in a 5 turn span.Mildly dissapointed in the direction this game took and as usual, it's too late to get a refund.

125,171.1,Not Recommended," December 4, 2016",3,"After putting some hours into the game i think i can now actually comment on it.And sadly this means that i cannot recommend this game in its current state (12-4-2016).This doesnt mean that the game has no good points to it, because there are quiet a few. The music is nice except for the menu music - that one is awesome. The graphics are a matter of taste obviously, but i found them to be nice to look at - which is important when a game takes such a long time. And of course its a civilisation game - so a lot of concepts are in the game just as expected. Oh yeah, and it is surprisingly enough fun to play in spite of its shortcomings.So why not recommend it ? Simply put - with a pricetag such as this product has its flaws are - in my eyes - unforgiveable.Exiting the game after playing for ""too long"" (time would have to be estimated) it will just not terminate and either force you to restart your computer or find a workaround to kill the game process. Bugs like that are major things that had to be known prior to release.And then we get to the ""design choices"" that are seriously impeding the fun for me.Like denouncing. You will get denounced by 70% of all civs for about 70% of the game (totally not made up numbers). For just about everything. You are a warmonger. Or have a different government. Or you have no spies in the ancient era. Or too little territory. Or to big of one. It actually doent matter - its the favourite past-time of the ai.Like the warmonger concept itself. Declare war on someone ? Warmonger. Get declared on ? Warmonger. Take a city ? Warmonger. Raze a city ? Guess for yourself. Do something like that (or have it done to you) and you are a warmonger. Forever. I think its like a certifikate of participation. Everyone gets one. No idea what it should accomplish, but as of now its just a reason for getting denounced. Not that the ai needs any reason for that.Like the religion thing. Doesnt work at all. The ai send myriads of religious units over the map in order to do some sightseeing i guess. Because theres not too much conversion happening while they stroll around your country happily blocking the way for anyone. There even was a war where one ai declared on me and then couldnt get any units through the clump of religios desaster that Pedro had seemingly exiled into my country. I think our armies fought each other via radio using harsh language until in the end Pericles payed for peace. Obviously it was the religious system at work here. Following the ai logik the best use for inquisitors is to round them up, herd them into enemy territory and then sacrifice them by attacking an obviously way superior unit - thereby eradicating any trace of the corresponding religion in the area. I can only guess the design process involved a lot of ""praying that it works"".Like the missing balance of science/culture points and corresponding techs. where you more or less have to spam future techs from 1950 onward. If you were lazy on techs, that is.Like diplomacy. Its basically not there. The ai cheats at every opportunity. They get bonuses like no tomorrow. Sadly they also get ""agendas"" to determine whether they like you or not. They might like cultured civs. That means not you because of their headstart you are pitiful to them. They might like civs with lots of territory. That means not you because of their headstart you have only a third of their land. If youre lucky. And due to this they basically hate you and it only gets worse from there. Did i mention they will denounce you ?I could go on and on, but that would not achieve anything here. It seems as if almost any concept in the game is only halfway there. And more or less untested. I guess the playtesters were actually playing another game and noone noticed. This game needs a lot of work to be good, because the framework is actually here. But it is really not ok to sell this mess at a pricetag that high.And that is why i advise to not get this game now - but maybe keep an eye on it.Hope this helps at least someone out there."

The dialogs are almost always not suited with the situation they are in. They are mostly in a rude and demanding attitude even when surrendering or asking for a favor for free. Gone are the sorry attitudes of AIs from Civ V.Religion is pointless.No United Nations / World Congress - a big blow to the diplomacy, which is nonexistent anyways.The cartoony graphics does not really appeal to me. I find it lazy and not really a huge step forward from Civ V.The game presents you a nice feature of custom-building your Civ V with different districts then trolls you by removing your control over when and where you can build your roads. Aparrently, trade caravans handle the civil works on the sides. A minor issue to most maybe.This is perhaps a good game broken by dysfunctional AI and by removing features present in the previous games that are not broken."

340,47.5,Recommended," October 24, 2016",3,"TL;DRIn a short summary, this is an excellent game crippled by AI, which will still be very enjoyable, especially with friends.Full review(pros and cons further down)SummaryThe game has the potential to be the best in the series, it has various new mechanics, the visuals are refreshing for the series, and replayability is amazing. Although probably the only ""major"" so to speak problem would be the AI and how it behaves.In the current state of the game, playing against AI is somewhere between boring and annoying.The problems the AI seem to have are the following:Another problem that is more evident in higher and lower difficulties is the unbalanced tech tree.An AI on king difficultyIn addition, the tree seems like it has multiple weird spots, such as archery not leading to anything, meaning you avoid it, fearing a waste of turns. Worse even is the top line of the tech tree, starting with sailing, which leads to compters without any intervention from the other tech lines.The UI is largely find and polished, namely the main menu being one of my favorites in gaming history (gotta love some christopher tin music), although it has some shortcomings, such as very small X buttons to exit diplomacy screens, and the auto unit-rotate feature which has caused me to waste so many movements.Players of previous civ games will know that the mid game has been nutoriously stale.Fortunately, in civ 6 this is mostly not the case, if you can build your cities properly, production wise.The game is mostly fine, although some people seem to report crashes on load, loads hanging and such, but those being pretty rare, it's not a real worry.The music for the game, composed by Christopher Tin is absolutely stellar.Some people have compared it to Baba Yetu, which won a grammy. I am one of those.is in my opinion the best main theme civ had. ever.The music for each civilization also evolves through the eras, having a very basic tune in the ancient era, and all the way to the information era, where the core melody (such as a banjo for america) remains, but has many layers added to it.Civ 6 has a very strong lineup of features and is generally very enjoyable, but due to a very annoying fault with the AI, it is somewhat problematic."
147,55.7,Recommended," January 23, 2017",3,"I love Civilzation games, but Civ 6 still needs more work. Work on A.I., mod support (PLEASE), and many other little things that make the game sometimes a drag and sort of grindy. Overall a good game though, just wished it had come out alittle later when all these little nuisances could of probably been worked out and made this game as great as Civ 5."
88,64.7,Not Recommended," December 21, 2016",3,"A.I is still garbage. It cheats by getting unfair advantages early on and does not compte on skill, making the whole game suck when you try to advance difficulty, the lower levels are too easy, the harder ones are unfair. All the gamplay is a bit faked as your often only just playing against a dumb A.I. They added better graphis, annoying Civ leader animations and a whole lot of polish, but it's still a dumb unfair game."

1,19.0,Recommended," October 22, 2016",3,"A definite improvement over previous entries, Civilization VI is one of the better strategy games of its kind and is addicting on several levels. Right now there are a few weird bugs and the UI could be a little improved but overall I would recommend this to anyone who liked any of the previous titles in the series. All of the systems from previous games have been either revamped, rebalanced, or rethought completely and it shows. AI is better, explanations of what gets on the AI's good side are better, districts are a wonderful alternative to straight city upgrades so you can specialize different physical areas of your civilization, and government policies are a wonderful change from the previous systems where you now pick and choose various attributes as you see fit as part of a larger whole. I could go on for days, really; there's so much to love about this game. Buy it, try it, you won't regret it for sure."

The AI and new ""Hidden Agendas"" are absolutely terrible. I struggled to get even one AI to like me. All the rest just wanted to go to war with me. Housing is a broken new system that has enormous potential, but was executed extremely poorly. The districts system also has lots of potential, but is completely broken. Production is now a commodity more sought after than gold or any luxury resource, even on Quick game mode. This game was a complete waste of $60.And the sad thing is, it didn't have to be.I wasn't that mad when I first bought this game and saw these broken aspects, because I figured that they would fix them quickly. But they didn't. Instead, they ignore their customer's complaints, and continue releasing stupid mini-DLCs just so that they can make even more money.The game also has SO MUCH potential, just everything was executed so poorly.Civ V was and is SOOOOOO much better than Civ VI. Do not waste your money on this worthless game. Do not be fooled by the legions of 9/10s and 10/10s that you see from all the ""professional"" reviewers. I'm not saying that they were paid off, but something definitely is not right, because this game sucks.Save your money, and your time.

I was not enjoying myself whatsoever like I had in Civ games previous to this one. This simply did not feel like a Civ game to me. What this was, was a board game with the ""Sid Meier's Civilization"" name slapped on it. This simply was not an improvement from its predecesors, and quite frankly, a waste of money, especially since I spent extra to buy any existing DLC that was to come out. No DLC could save this game from what it is, and that is a downgrade; plain and simple. It might be a long time before the next release of a Sid Meier's Civilization title, but after playing this game, I am not sure it is worth getting my hopes up for."
19,0.4,Not Recommended," May 27, 2017",3,"Right off the bat, this game explains nothing to you, it simply puts you into the world and expects you to know what to do. The turns progress without you wanting them to, and the forces which YOU are supposed to be in control of pretty much do whatever they want. You have absolutely no control of what land you claim as far as I can tell, but that might just be me since the game still has not explained any of the controls. Every single time something happens on the map, the game diverts your attention from whatever you are doing to that thing, and once again, you have almost no control of what is happening. I simply would not recommend this game to anyone."
19,1.7,Not Recommended," June 8, 2017",3,Not impressed at all. I've played Civ from the first one but find myself lost and confused by this edition. Plus the graphics are worse than the last version or at least on Win 7 which is a real shame. Some things may have needed improvemenmt in past iterations of this game franchise but I think they may have went too far this time.

318,1.4,Not Recommended," June 30, 2017",3,"Whilst an hour and a half is perhaps not enough time to form a real opinion, I am limited to Steams 2 hour refund policy so I'm playing this one safe and requesting a refund.I thorougly enjoyed Civ IV back in the day and absoultly love the final (all DLCs) version of Civ V and was really looking forward to Civ VI. However I was reluctant to pre order (way back when) and given some of the mixed reports I opted to wait for decent sales price. Unfortunetly I feel myself siding with the more negative reviews and agree that Civ 6 feels like it took one step forward and 2 steps back. Graphically it's taken a more cartoon look ..which is neither good nor bad as some things work where others do not. Game play wise though is where the biggest diffrence happens. Once upon a time I could que things up, set workers and scouts on auto pilot and worry solely about growing my empire and army. Now I have to micro manage every little detail. Workers only last 3 turns, I have to decide what each city is going to be about before I've really started building anything and I have to plan each and every move scouts take.This may or may not be a good thing in the long term but the changes are huge from Civ V and instead of being quirky and new, I found them irritating and lackluster. Had the game not been so expensive (£42 at sales price including DLC) I may have been tempted to stick it out longer but for the price I was neither hooked nor interest in the game. A single senario Demo could have been the real deciding factor but those days are long gone. Civ V (which I bought as a full game at launch and the DLC as it released) has given me hundreds of hours of gameplay and not once have I questioned my purchase. I truely thank Fraxis for that. Civ VI however had me questioning my purchase (at least at the price) in 60 mins.As with the previous Civ games, I suspect the additional content will make all the diffrence and offer a much better gameplay experiance once it's added / released. Till then, if you don't own them I'd recommend buying Civ V + Civilization Beyond Earth instead as you'll get a much grander 2 game experiance for less money.However...I will return Civ VI. you will be re purchased and played one day. But not before you mature in content and gameplay a bit more. You're just to expensive a date for my tastes at this point."

AI seemed to have odd issues (only had chance to notice ones with wars and diplomacy). The fact that almost every single dlc is rated at either very negative or overwhelmingly negative (all from either technical or conceptual problems) is pretty disheartening and gives reason not to buy. If you get this on a really good sale (>60% off) or for free, go for it if you want.

The early stages of the game are reminiscent of past versions, and I enjoyed learning what's new and setting up a few civilizations, but have had the patience to complete the game only once, and that was a chore. Once the world gets a little complicated, the game slows down to where the time between turns stretches to minutes. I usually get up and go do something else while waiting for the next turn. Not an enjoyable way to play.And then there are the crashes. At least three times the game has crashed my system to the point that I have to shut down and reboot. One time the only way I managed that was to pull the plug, as the computer was completely frozen.I find this product to be Not Worth the Expense and Trouble."
31,163.6,Recommended," October 24, 2016",3,"I've given Civ VI a try...over 220 turns worth of it so far. Enough to have a good feel for the game. As a Civ veteran I was able to pick it all up pretty quickly and it's not too much different than Civ V. But it is different. Not sure if I really like it or not right now, kind of on the fence. I like the map, especially the effects regarding the unknown and areas you've explored. I actually rather like the districts for cities. It's different and seems to work OK. I also like that you can't spam every wonder you see. Like others, I think the AI is not very good...but it's never really all that good in a Civ game so that's nothing new. I don't like the rather cartoony feel of the explored map and the units. I don't dislike it either but it's glaringly different in look from Civ V so will take some getting used to. I am mixed about the cartoony feel of the leader screens too. Is Civ VI the best yet? I reserve judgement for now. Overall the game has a good feel and flow about it and it's certainly got that Civ 'just one more turn...' addiction going for it. And so far it hasn't felt buggy, no crashes or anything. And it works well on fairly minimal specs. But I'm also not going to stop playing Civ V yet either. Still I like Civ VI and we'll see what it looks like after they add updates to it."

41,2.1,Not Recommended, February 9,3,"I haven't played it long but as an avid Civ 5 player here are my thoughts...I have seen other people's reviews, some videos, etc but wanted to give it a try myself.-VisuallyThe menu when the game loads up is amazing and the music is epic, then I started the tutorial and was greeted by clash of clans for PC. That would be ok if I downloaded clash of clans to play, but this is Civ, I expect a more refined and adult environment.The terrain looks cheap and the characters look like plastic toys. If you zoom in the level of detail is obviously missing.-MechanicsAgain haven't gotten too far yet but it seems the mechanics are pretty good, I was just in the city planning part of the tutorial, but I decided to build a library a turn ahead of the tutorial and when it finally came up the tutorial didn't reconize I already started it and the interface froze, forcing me to close and abandon my work.So the later mechanics I can't speak to, but what I saw to that point looked promising.Overall would I recommend this... I don't really know, I am going to say NoHaving played Civ 5 I know what they are capable of making, but it seems they were eager to rip off the mobile game look/fad, which is sad. Especially when other games are pushing the bounds of detail and realism (Again not that I expect that here I just gave up playing with my Stretch Armstrong a long time ago...)I am not a graphics snob by far, I have played much worse, but opening this expecting to play Risk or Axis & Allies and being greeted by Mr Potato Head is... well sad!----Also consider this a plea to the devs to create a ""classic"" texture option for the game!"
272,83.6,Recommended," October 24, 2016",3,"Great and proud continuation of the Civilization series, and my new personal favourite. The new game introduces a variety of fun and indepth features and as a Civ fan all the more neat stuff to learn and explore. On my first playthrough, and while only barely into Modern era, I've already experienced the power of conquest, effects of intricate democracy and ideological warfare. Playing as Rome and being placed onto a continent between two city states, and alongside the Spanish empire, I knew things would get interesting real quick when barely into Ancient era the Spanish empire had put its conquest agenda to play after wiping out an unknown neighbor civ and then turning it's gaze to a city state right on my door step accross an entire continent. After seeing the Spanish horde surround my neighbor I had to step in and the battle for Jerusalem became the turning point in history. The victory was short lived however, and after but a short period of peace, the Spanish empire had become aggressively expansive again, settling a city outpost right next to Jerusalem, no doubt to launch a bigger invasion, and this time with a proper supply line. Constant influx of military equipment and soldiers, as well as constant provocations and tresspasses on the territory of my national interests, and all around my newly formed outpost, had pushed Rome to act and declare a war on Spain once again. This time however the Spanish horde was no match for the might of Roman legions. Not only I pushed Spain back, destroying and razing its forward outpost on my borders, I took the fight all the way to their capital. After Madrid seige and conquest the Spanish empire was no more but a broken people with loud barks of denounciations but no power to back them up. Rome had finally proved and established its place as a continental military power with no match, only for new civilzations to take up a different kind of warfare, war of the mind. Scythia and Brazil which surround Rome on continents on either side had turned Rome into an ideological battlefield sending hordes of missionaries and religious zealots. But as things looked bleak, and while almost being completely overwhelmed by foreign influence, a chance presented itself. Brazil thought its actions would be without consequence when they attacked my dear Toronto, a city state on their continent, however Rome officials were not swayed by Brazilian religious propaganda, and finally they had a reason for a defensive war against the aggressors as a suzerain and protector of Toronto. Rome, being a shining light of technological progress, was able to overwhelm Brazilian outdated military. With musketman and knights rampaging throughout their lands Brazil had no choice but to cede the capital and two additional cities after their conquest. Having Brazil's capital, and their only religious center, under Rome's control had eased and put a stop to Brazil's religious convesions under the banner of Islam, and their hopes at world domination through religion. This exersion of Rome's political and military might with Brazil had influenced Scythia to formally agree not to convert and spread their ideology within Roman borders. With this, Rome was able to free itself from the spread of foreign ideology and return to their own roots and traditions. What kind of adversities and challenges lay ahead and will Rome be able to persevere, it remains to be seen ..."

I waited awhile and bought the humble bundle deal to get the full experience. But so far I'm pretty unhappy with the art direction and the cartoonish leaders. The user interface is kind of annoying and not as explanative as the previous game. Overall It feels like a step backwards and sort of lazy in it's design.

283,33.1,Recommended, February 15,3,"A good series has sequels that iterate on their successors and build on them. The Civ series isn't like that, yet each game ends up being good. Civ VI is good. Great, sometimes. It's just not the new hotness it should be, but it could be there in the future.As a disclaimer, my experience with Civ VI is almost entirely with the new Rise and Fall expansion. As is the case with all Civ games, the expansions are vital.There's a lot of new features here that work pretty well, and some old ones that are tweaked for convenience and are generally better. City management has gotten the biggest overhaul this time, and I like it. Instead of being able to just build anything available in your city centers, you have to build districts that physically occupy tiles. Build them in certain areas, you can get bonuses for their respective outputs (science, culture, production, etc.) Waging war have been overhauled, now with different types of wars with varying penalties. Religious victories are a more active experience than before, requiring religious combat and inquisitions. Roads are streamlined now, made by just sending your traders out to build them as they go. Where some games in Civ V had very few roads in them, Civ VI is littered with them by the halfway point. Spies are producible now.The Rise and Fall expansion, which, again, you should buy, adds governors, loyalty, and golden age overhauls. Civs can lose their cities to rebellions if loyalty is low, which makes them ripe for the taking. Or, liberate and return them for diplomacy. Establish governors to build loyalty and upgrade them with useful buffs for the city. Achieve enough 'era events' and enter golden ages. Don't achieve enough, and you'll enter a dark age.I mentioned this game wasn't quite 'there yet,' and it's mostly because of what's missing, not what's there being bad. Diplomatic victories and the World Congress didn't make a return, and they really should have. That's the big one.The art direction is wonderful, and the map is a lot more visually interesting than the previous games. Leaders are expressive in their diplomacy screens and have a lot of personality. Sean Bean is a great narrator.Civ VI is good. It could be, and I believe it will be, better."
52,5.5,Not Recommended, February 18,3,"I don't write negative reviews.This game is so bad it deserves it. I'll write this in a good, bad, ugly format.The Good:The new district system, and, to a lesser extent, the wonders encourage you to plan your expansion. No longer do you just spam out mines, farms and wonders.The aethstetics are adorable. They're really nice and cartoony, and the animation in the leader screens is flawless.Leader and civilization traits are so much more diverse and useful now, with the unique units and buildings really making each civ stand out.The Bad:The gap between turn times is very very long. It's not a huge problem, but having to turn on quick movement and combat to complete a game in a realistic timeframe just kinda ruins it.Oh look, the rise and fall expansion has come out. The price is even more extortianate now, and if I have to pay extra to make a game playable... no thanks. I understand you need to make a profit, but it's getting ridiculous.The price tag is also a bit... big. I got it on sale, but £50?Government forms become way to difficult to handle in the late game, with all of the civics overwhelming you. At the end, I had around 70+ civics to choose from. I spent hours deciding which one to pickThe Ugly:Oh, the AI. The AI just ruins the game. To give you a picture of how bad it is, I had Sumeria and Greece as neighbours. We should be the best of friends. But nope, they don't like me because they suddenly changed their government forms, and I did something against their agendas. So they both declare war on me.(5 archers from Greece turn up)(5 archers from Sumeria turn up)(They die to a large amount of my war chariots)So I take this to my advantage, make peace with Greece (hey that rhymes) and siege a Sumerian city. All is going well when suddenly... the peace treaty with Greece expires. They declare war on me.(5 archers from Greece turn up)(They die to a large amount of my war chariots)So rinse, repeat, rinse repeat, eventually I annex both of them. Cool. Oh, by the way, everyone thinks I'm a warmonger now. (In fact, you get dubbed a warmonger just for defending yourself). Oh well, I've got infantry by this point, they're all renaissance and industrial plebs. Oh look, China declared war on me because I built a wonder, and their agenda doesn't like that. They throw a hissy fit.(5 musketmen from China turn up)(They die to a large amount of my infantry)I let China go with a peace deal, but the entire world thinks I'm a warmonger. However China's just doing fine, without anyone calling them a warmonger.You see, this is what ruins the game. A large network of agendas means that you can't be friends with one person without annoying everyone else. That isn't civ. That's accidentally walking into a group of people and having them swear at you for 5 minutes. It's horrible.3/10"
19,25.1,Not Recommended, February 16,3,"The franchise has lost a lot by its design choices. The mini map basically just shows too many squares (cities) making it just ugly and clustered basically useless. The units all look extremely cute, so not at all like units. And in general there is no atmosphere of leading an empire, more so a cute little I don't even know what to call it.Sorry, a big fan of the franchise and not the only one that is disapointed."
117,66.1,Recommended," November 2, 2016",3,"I've been playing Civ games since Civ II.Each game in the series, despite the core elements, is a vastly different experience. For me, Civ V was extremely simple - effortless, really. This one is completely different. While some elements are greatly ""streamlined"" (and in turn, slightly more complicated for the established Civ player), they are designed well. The removal of Global Hapiness is welcome in my opinion. The districts and non-automated improvements make you put more thought into city placement and development. I'm not sure about the resource requirements for units - it's easier, maybe just too easy at some cases. Also, the sparsity of critical resourses, like iron, coal and such makes resource wars a more common occurance than in previous installments.The Graphics are great! Most games nowadays have a very... gritty aesthetic to them. Civilization VI, with it's nice, more artistic style, vibrant color scheme and, in my opinion, light-hearted visuals is a soothing escape from modern AAA titles with ZitVision 2k and ToenailWorks HD engines. This aesthetic brings a... wishful and optimistic look to a game about conquering the world. The soundtrack this time around was so on-point that I've actually kept it on for as long as I've played. Don't get me wrong - Baba Yetu was great, but I just wasn't enjoying the soundtrack as much as this one.My main and only complaint, is the AI. Regardless of the difficulty, you simply do not have luxury of slowly building your empire from the start. The AI is hyper-aggressive from the start, the negotion AI is pretty hard to please (but can be fooled with not much effort). Despite the aggression, you can exploit the AI's inability to fully utilize their military in a logical manner. It's just a lot harder if you're a player that wants to play a non-militant leader.There are bugs here and there that cause a slight bit of frustration, but that's to be expected in the initial release.Compared to vanila versions of previous Civ games, this one is very well packaged with features. More civilization options would have been a welcome addition, but that's probably coming later on.Speaking of which, I have high hopes and a complete uncertainty as to what to expect from upcoming expansions to Civ VI. The expansions to Civ V were excellent and made an already incredible game that much more better.In conclusion, I had my initial doubts about all these new changes to the game. However, they turned out alright. Civilization VI is a very good follow-up to it's previous itterations. Although there are issues with the AI, I hope that it will be adressed with either an update or an expansion. If you are a Civ fan, you will most likely enjoy it. So far I've completed two playthroughs with Gorgo and enjoyed every single minute of the >30 hours I've put into it. From learning from my initial mistakes, to understanding advanced planning tactics, it's a great experience for fans of Civilization!"
130,62.5,Recommended," November 24, 2016",3,"The District Mechanic adds some strategic element when settling cities, although its impacts are a bit obscure and need people to read either in-game encyclopaedia (which does not contain all info at times and/or has faulty entries in some details) or read/watch tutorials on-line. This is important as your cities grow and you realize you waisted Builder action on a tile that now will be removed by the district. Also very important is that once you start a district you cant cancel it and worse you cant remove it, so make sure you hit the right tile. The planing ahead should also not be exclusive to existing bonuses, looking at tiles and plan what improvements go where and thus what districts go adjacent in future, to maximise city outputs.Combat is still pretty much the same as in Civ V, which is OK I guess, with the corps/armadas mechanic that I think is not really that great tbh. Coming from EU4, I feel combat could be improved quite a bit, for example allow the creation of armies, where you can add units of various types to it.The last bit I need to mention is this rather lengthy ramble, is diplomacy. Yes they added a few ticks that are nice, but diplomacy is just as moronic as ever. There is no sense to interaction for most part and it does not help that AI actions do not reflect diplomacy information AT ALL! For example, in a game with 6 other civs, the 2 civs that were FRIENDLY! Surprise DoWed me BOTH (in different times, maybe 20-30 turns apart). What gives?Great people system is pretty good, I like this approach, but the Writers, Musicians and Artists really need to be looked at, its silly that I cant keep up with building places to store stuff these people create and that they are otherwise just useless. There should be a way to activate the person and get a % boost to cultures or a one time boost to specific wonders, like with some engineers, or even just whatever amount of culture, like scientist. In one game I had to sell great works to make use of the writers, and even that capped as they only ever buy one and only if they dont have one yet (at least thats what I gathered)."
228,393.2,Recommended," November 28, 2016",3,"The latest version of Civilization is much like its predecessors - not perfect by any means, but still a great game, and a prime example of the 4X strategy genre. And I fully expect that it will only get better as more content is released, just like the previous versions. I fully recommend it for anyone looking for a good grand strategy game.Like most sequels, this one is at once familiar and different, so I'll focus on the changes from previous versions. On the whole, I find the game more enjoyable and there are more options to pursue tha in Civ V. I like the added strategic and thematic options that have been introduced, and generally consider the new features to be improvements. The big problem right now is that the AI struggles to provide a significant challenge for experienced players, perhaps because it hasn't learned how best to navigate the variety of significant new strategic options. Since Civ will always be primarily a single-player game, this is a significant issue, although the game remains entertaining nonetheless.The district system is probably the biggest and most obvious change, shifting the vast majority of buildings into specialized tiles and forcing a number of new strategic decisions on the player. The choice of which districts a city builds influences how the city develops, determining which buildings it can build and what types of Great People it will contribute towards, making long term planning more important since the number of districts a city can build is limited by population. Now each city will have its own unique mix of builidngs, as opposed to mostly being a copy of all your other cities. I've seen a number of opinions on the change, but personally, I like the added strategic layers the district system provides, from planning your own development in peace time to increasing the impact of raiding forces during war, since most buildings can be damaged and disabled by attacking or looting the district that houses them.Another major change is splitting the tech tree into two halves - a traditional tech tree with progress based on research and a separate civics tree where progress is instead based on culture. The tech tree unlocks buildings and units, while the civics tree unlocks diplomatic, trade, and governmental choices (mostly in the form of new policy options you can employ which let you boost specific abilities of your civ according to the needs of the moment), with Wonders split amongst the two. Additionally, both types of research can be sped significantly through achievements your civ reaches, such as building particular units or taking specific actions related to a tech or civic. Overall, I again feel the changes are positive, enabling an empire that struggles to keep up in one area to compensate by excelling in another. The boosts do tend to accelerate the speed of progress overall, since you can cut research time in half by meeting the boosting criteria, so usually the various eras are reached long before the time period they represented historically. But they do give the player another set of minigoals to focus their efforts on.The last major change is a dramatic increase in the importance of location to a wide variety of things. Districts gain boosts based on the terrain and development of tiles around them, making them more effective if properly placed. Each Wonder has a terrain-based unlock criteria in addition to the tech/civic based one, making it impossible to just build a single mega-city that racks up production and builds most of the world's Wonders based on its output alone. Again, this increases challenge and strategic options, since your plans are more closely tied to the details of the spaecific play-through. It also allows players to remain competitive for Wonders even if they aren't on the cutting edge of research, since opponents may not be able to start work on a project until long after they unlock the relevant tech.As in previous versions (and in most other 4X strategy games), the weak link is the AI. Harder difficulties are mostly just added starting resources and discounts on AI costs for all activities. The challenge of a new difficulty level is heavily front-loaded as a result - if you can survive an initial rush by AI civs fueled initial advantage in units, the game is only slightly harder at higher difficulties. The AI also seems less aggressive than in previous versions, and as long as you maintain a reasonable defensive force and aren't deliberately provocative, you can often go multiple eras without a war, much less a challenging one. The wars that do happen (whether or not they involve a human player) tend to be settled quickly and (in the case of AI vs. AI wars) indecisively. Once the balance tips towards one side, the other quickly offers peace on generous terms, knowing it probably can't rebuild it's army quickly enough to recover. If one side has managed to take an established city or two, this often means the AI will offer the majority of its available resources and an extra city or two, in addition to giving up its claims on the conquered territory.Improvements are needed in the AI's focus on achieving victory conditions, as well. It is often impossible to determine what type of victory an AI civ is pursuing, unless that strategy is being very successful. At higher difficulties, at least, each civ ought to be attempting at least one type of victory, ideally changing plans if another path seems easier while still remaining committed enough to not paralyze itself by constantly switching course. But in most games it does not appear that most of the civs are actually trying to win at all, instead sitting in a largely passive clump of medicority in all facets while one or two more successful civs push for the win. Often no AI is attempting one or more of the victory types (for instance, I've never seen an AI civ make an obvious attempt at a domination (military) victory). It would be much more challenging if these issues could be overcome and the AI would provide a more significant challenge in the late game.But despite these concerns, this is still an excellent game, and highly enjoyable for both new and experienced players."

I lost touch with the series after that.That said... the soul of Civilization seems to have been lost too. It has followed the path of large development studios that make pretty things because pretty things sell, but don't give a damn about producing mechanics that make any sense.There's all these Sean Bean voiceovers. They soon grow tiresome. I don't need everything reading to me, thanks. Meanwhile the tutorial is obnoxiously long winded with endless repetition.So I quit the tutorial after a few minutes despite being none-the-wiser on how to play. I start out as Vikings. I fiddle about with some things using the rather unintuitive UI, mostly guessing based on my past experience but seeing qutie a bit of additional complexity. I move some units near the coast. They get fired at by archers over the English Channel - y'know, that 30km sea between the UK and Europe. Oh, and over mountains too. What the ... ?I immediatelly stopped at that point. I'm not going to bother investing time learning all the crazy complexities of a game (and it throws so many numbers at you, way more than the originals, and the UI is awful with the City management dialog compressed into the corner of the screen) if they can't even design something so fundamentally simple to make sense.I'd have refunded it if I could (I got it as part of a bundle, unfortunately)."

However I was reluctant to pre order (way back when) and given some of the mixed reports I opted to wait for decent sales price. Unfortunetly I feel myself siding with the more negative reviews and agree that Civ 6 feels like it took one step forward and 2 steps back. Graphically it's taken a more cartoon look ..which is neither good nor bad as some things work where others do not. Game play wise though is where the biggest diffrence happens. Once upon a time I could que things up, set workers and scouts on auto pilot and worry solely about growing my empire and army. Now I have to micro manage every little detail. Workers only last 3 turns, I have to decide what each city is going to be about before I've really started building anything and I have to plan each and every move scouts take.This may or may not be a good thing in the long term but the changes are huge from Civ V and instead of being quirky and new, I found them irritating and lackluster. Had the game not been so expensive (£42 at sales price including DLC) I may have been tempted to stick it out longer but for the price I was neither hooked nor interest in the game. A single senario Demo could have been the real deciding factor but those days are long gone. Civ V (which I bought as a full game at launch and the DLC as it released) has given me hundreds of hours of gameplay and not once have I questioned my purchase. I truely thank Fraxis for that. Civ VI however had me questioning my purchase (at least at the price) in 60 mins.As with the previous Civ games, I suspect the additional content will make all the diffrence and offer a much better gameplay experiance once it's added / released. Till then, if you don't own them I'd recommend buying Civ V + Civilization Beyond Earth instead as you'll get a much grander 2 game experiance for less money.However...I will return Civ VI. you will be re purchased and played one day. But not before you mature in content and gameplay a bit more. You're just to expensive a date for my tastes at this point."
150,36.8,Not Recommended," January 18, 2017",3,"Product received for freeRubbish game that doesn't meet expectations. It takes forever to get anything done and quickly becomes repetitive. AI factions behave like headless chickens and it is nearly impossible to please any of them, resulting in all your allies turning on you towards the midgame. To rub additional salt in the wounds, the game features some useless cinematic diplomacy screen, where these factions regularly interrupt your gameplay to yell some insults at you. You have to click this screen away not once, but twice, every time this happens. Usually within a few turns of proclaiming how much they hate you, they'll demand that you give them free goodies, again through this highly annoying diplomacy interface. No matter how much stuff you give them, they'll continue to hate you, make war with you and insult you.If this was the only bad thing it'd be somewhat acceptable, but the rest isn't much better. Buildings can take dozens of turns to construct, making it highly annoying to build up additional cities from scratch. Construction times are mainly determined by the production in the city, which is modified by the terrain of the tiles around the city. You'll need builders to transform this terrain into something more useful, but once again it takes forever to recruit a builder and to add insult to injury, the builders expire after several uses, so a lot of clunky micromangement is needed and the game pace slows to a crawl.In undiscovered tiles Barbarians may spawn, but these either do nothing useful or are a complete bane to your existence in the early game. As mentioned before, everything takes a zillion turns to do, so if you're in the middle of constructing a building and a Barbarian spawns, it can take a dozen turns before you finally get a military unit to deal with the threat, because military recruitment and building construction both use the same production points. Highly annoying and stupid.AI isn't just annoying in diplomacy, but also a complete pushover as they do not play the terrain modification game well, so they quickly fall behind in the technology race. It is also terrible managing its armies and having some long-ranged units typically defeats most AI armies without taking any losses as they're too stupid to close the gap or position their own long-ranged stuff in a place where it can actually hit anything.I almost forgot the graphics. They are atrocious and look like some mobile freemium garbage game. Ah, maybe that's there they got their ideas for their DLC policy from.3/10 for the half decent intro, musical score and the fact that it doesn't crash, no points earned for fun and good gameplay."
129,26.3,Not Recommended," October 22, 2017",3,"If you ae buying this as the next step from Civ V.... Don't. You'll be thoroughly disappointed.I usually ease myself into a game by starting with a couple of AIs and on the simplest settings. get to know the mechanics and then the next campaign pump up the difficulty, etc.I ended up playing 10 hours, running 4 senarios at the settler level, 4 different leaders, against AIs ranging from 3 to 7 opponents. I couldn't figure it out, after playing 600 hours of Civ V, I was expecting there to be some level of progression linking. I was wrong.- The AIs were schizophrenic in their actions, even at settler level, heaven forbid what the inequality boons are like at prince/king/immortal is like... I played against America in 3 scenarios, completely random personalities each time, its almost as if Rosavelt had a gandhi complex in one senario (the age old, ""lets all be friends!... and i'll nuke you"")- The game mechanic forces your playstyle towards domination due to the random nature of the AIs, if you dont keep a balenced policy tree and build a reasonable defence, you'll end up in generational wars you wont be able to keep up with or dominate the opponents... I personally dont want to be winning the game using domination every time, it would be nice to adapt to the situation once in a while.- Which takes me to the civic and science trees. if you are looking for a playstyle like civ 5, dont bother. there is little to no ability to adapt the game to your own playstyle or adapting your playstyle to victory conditions of certain leaders. for example; in Civ 5 you could rush to medieval era pushing through one line of science (usually i did through stonehenge, boosting faith, establishing a foothold.)... rushing through either of the tech trees will leave you at a great disadvantage... i then tried going through the science tree normally on two scenarios, boosted science in campuses, still ended up behind the other AIs in tech...

272,83.6,Recommended," October 24, 2016",3,"Great and proud continuation of the Civilization series, and my new personal favourite. The new game introduces a variety of fun and indepth features and as a Civ fan all the more neat stuff to learn and explore. On my first playthrough, and while only barely into Modern era, I've already experienced the power of conquest, effects of intricate democracy and ideological warfare. Playing as Rome and being placed onto a continent between two city states, and alongside the Spanish empire, I knew things would get interesting real quick when barely into Ancient era the Spanish empire had put its conquest agenda to play after wiping out an unknown neighbor civ and then turning it's gaze to a city state right on my door step accross an entire continent. After seeing the Spanish horde surround my neighbor I had to step in and the battle for Jerusalem became the turning point in history. The victory was short lived however, and after but a short period of peace, the Spanish empire had become aggressively expansive again, settling a city outpost right next to Jerusalem, no doubt to launch a bigger invasion, and this time with a proper supply line. Constant influx of military equipment and soldiers, as well as constant provocations and tresspasses on the territory of my national interests, and all around my newly formed outpost, had pushed Rome to act and declare a war on Spain once again. This time however the Spanish horde was no match for the might of Roman legions. Not only I pushed Spain back, destroying and razing its forward outpost on my borders, I took the fight all the way to their capital. After Madrid seige and conquest the Spanish empire was no more but a broken people with loud barks of denounciations but no power to back them up. Rome had finally proved and established its place as a continental military power with no match, only for new civilzations to take up a different kind of warfare, war of the mind. Scythia and Brazil which surround Rome on continents on either side had turned Rome into an ideological battlefield sending hordes of missionaries and religious zealots. But as things looked bleak, and while almost being completely overwhelmed by foreign influence, a chance presented itself. Brazil thought its actions would be without consequence when they attacked my dear Toronto, a city state on their continent, however Rome officials were not swayed by Brazilian religious propaganda, and finally they had a reason for a defensive war against the aggressors as a suzerain and protector of Toronto. Rome, being a shining light of technological progress, was able to overwhelm Brazilian outdated military. With musketman and knights rampaging throughout their lands Brazil had no choice but to cede the capital and two additional cities after their conquest. Having Brazil's capital, and their only religious center, under Rome's control had eased and put a stop to Brazil's religious convesions under the banner of Islam, and their hopes at world domination through religion. This exersion of Rome's political and military might with Brazil had influenced Scythia to formally agree not to convert and spread their ideology within Roman borders. With this, Rome was able to free itself from the spread of foreign ideology and return to their own roots and traditions. What kind of adversities and challenges lay ahead and will Rome be able to persevere, it remains to be seen ..."

As a Civ veteran I was able to pick it all up pretty quickly and it's not too much different than Civ V. But it is different. Not sure if I really like it or not right now, kind of on the fence. I like the map, especially the effects regarding the unknown and areas you've explored. I actually rather like the districts for cities. It's different and seems to work OK. I also like that you can't spam every wonder you see. Like others, I think the AI is not very good...but it's never really all that good in a Civ game so that's nothing new. I don't like the rather cartoony feel of the explored map and the units. I don't dislike it either but it's glaringly different in look from Civ V so will take some getting used to. I am mixed about the cartoony feel of the leader screens too. Is Civ VI the best yet? I reserve judgement for now. Overall the game has a good feel and flow about it and it's certainly got that Civ 'just one more turn...' addiction going for it. And so far it hasn't felt buggy, no crashes or anything. And it works well on fairly minimal specs. But I'm also not going to stop playing Civ V yet either. Still I like Civ VI and we'll see what it looks like after they add updates to it."

They still declare war on you without alot of provocation. If you look at the nature of the Leaders there are some things that just♥♥♥♥♥♥them off (like doing any business with a city state that Pericles thinks he owns), which it does not matter how friendly you have been in the past it will still bite you. Also it appears AI will intentionally travel across the map to put cities next to you, but if you put one too close to them, all hell breaks lose. Barbarians are still not fixed and they can have a camp near you as early as turn 2 (I am guessing they were there turn 1, but I could not yet see them)I will stick with my original review of the game below. I will not yet give it a thumbs up, as I still believe there is a lot of room for improvement, but I do like the game, once you get used to dealing with all the hostility, so if you are into some minor pain, but could feel good about trying a new system, then I say take the chance... but maybe buy it on sale.""Although I love many aspects of this game, I cannot recommend it until they make some major advancements in development. AI is so random the game typically is not only not as fun as it should be, it is absolute anarchy. Your Friends declare surprise war on you when you have treated them like a friend from the beginning and there is no reason to hate you. Barbarians begin the game with horses and archers when you have to develop them, leaving you so open to travesty that it is unacceptable. The User interface leaves much to be desired as many of the old common UI items are hidden and almost impossible to find. There is a shortage of some basic natural resources in the game like Iron, that makes it much harder to compete with the overwhelming can of whoop♥♥♥♥♥being opened upon you by barbarians and your ""friends"" alike. since I have been a Civ player since Civ 1, I see a sincere lack of testing and development that I am certainly NOT used to with this franchise.

396,100.1,Recommended," October 24, 2016",3,"Let's get this out of the way: The interface is crappy and bugged. The AI is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. The balance is nonexistant.Everything else though, is just plain brilliant. Civilization VI reaches the levels of complexity, strategy and long-term planning that Civilization V never reached with its two expansions. Gone are the days of oversimplified early-game, with impotent barbarians and expanding your empire to random places just to grab some resources. Gone are the days of bribing all the city-states with tons of gold and winning the game automatically once the UN is founded. The district system, the religious victory and the enhanced city-state diplomacy create whole new layers of gameplay.Everything needs more thinking and more careful planning now - which by the way might be why this installment is getting so many negative opinions so far: you can't just play it like SimCity, spamming building and wonders with no caution paid to other players. You need to pick the best spots for your cities which will allow you to grab as many adjacency bonuses as you can. You need to pay attention to all the victory conditions constantly. You need to actively fight the barbarian hordes. You need to think.But all is not well in Civilization VI. As I've said at the beginning, the game lacks polish in some areas and has serious flaws - but nothing that can't be patched.EDIT: Seriously, the ""r-word"" for mentally challenged is censored?"

But in having a selective view of historical fact, it demonstrates its ability to faor AI players over human players.Case in point, and the reason for the title of this review, is that two Salems, and several other historical events of a similar vein, is the inability to kill Missionaries with forces defending cities. 2000 years ago, soldiers were involved the removal of a key religous figure in one ""Salem"". Nearly 1700 years later, another ""Salem"" was at the center of another ""religious persecution"" at the hands of forces. There are more examples throughout written history, but apparentlly not where Civ VI's designers want the game to go, since you can't send city defenders after missionairies in the game.This is just one of a list of flaws with the game, but in short, if I could get my money back on this game, I would. Civ VI is a basic Civ 3 with an updated GUI."
257,12.4,Not Recommended, February 16,3,It is just not fun.All the animations (especially diplomacy) take far too long and slow down the glacial pace of the game even further. Everything feels like it takes too long so you spend many turns just clicking the next turn button. I hate that the builders expire after doing 3 actions and then you need another dozen turns to build another but then your city is even further behind the AI in buildings. It makes the tile improvements feel weak and the only ones worth it are strategic/luxury resources. Any other tile improvements you will most likly build a district on top of in the future anyway. The district system seems interesting on the surface but it quickly just becomes another building that you also can boost by picking the right green hex.All together the game is just not fun and I found I spent more time in a web browser tab than actually engaged with the game. At least the borderless fullscreen works flawlessly.

It's some kind of open beta.Thou we have very interesting mechanics like amenities and war weariness, they are not transparent, unclear. More to mention – no diplomacy and politic. They do have them in Civ V and CivBE, but for some reason no diplomatic capital, no world congress in Civ VI (guess they will be introduced in the Add-on).So consider wafting for few more patches or even few Add-ons – Civ VI not ready and not worth buying yet.Update after 3rd add-on: game still unready. Simplest things like building queue, other player resource navigation, indication of previous trade route… All that was in Civ V and for some reason missed here.

74,242.5,Not Recommended," August 10, 2017",3,"It's with a heavy heart I have to admit I don't like Civ 6, and I really tried. I have well over 1000 hrs on each of the previous two Civ games and I grew up with the franchise. I was excited for the new installment, of course, and really enjoyed many of the new changes, on their face. However, the game's flaws don't take long to reveal themselves and downright spoil the whole thing.It's as many others have already said. The diplomacy is awful. It's arbitrary and mostly downright silly. The eureka mechanic, which I enjoyed learning at first, actually make progression a prescribed process. The game is also at times very light on customization features in a way that feels undeniably like steps backward from Civ 5 (SOME of which they've since patched).The game beautiful, you can't deny that. And the city planning is much deeper, and was my favorite part of the game. City placement and building takes much more forward planning than in previous games. It takes a lot of adjacency and wonder requirement knowledge to really maximize the process, and I wish I could enjoy the rest of the game enough to have kept learning, but for now I'm fed up.I have hope that the game CAN be fixed, but changes have insufficient and slow to come. They need to admit defeat with their current diplomacy system and do a pretty deep overhaul. The eurekas could be somehow randomized to make the order of operations less static. Features can be added to flesh out the customization. I hope they don't let me down, because I would hate to say goodbye to the franchise I've held dear for so long."

I had one issue where the game got into a loop that a couple units needed action before I could end my turn but it would not show me which units. I saved the game, loaded back up and then it works perfect.I did start over and am playing as Rome. I am really liking the new mechanics and features. I have gotten comfortable with the UI and all the little changes.Some more things I noticed... The technology tree and social tree are very different and feel like they move slower. I like that I can actually play different time periods vs the same speed in Civ V. I also noticed that at Prince the difficulty seems much lower than Prince in Civ V.I still miss the throne room from Civ II (III?) and the ability to zoom all the way out to see the globe.Recommended? YES!!!10/30/16:I picked this yesterday. I gave been a fan of Civilization games since Civ II excluding Beyond Earth which I also have. I wanted to see how different this was compared to Civ V and it is quite different. If you read anything about this game you will know the UI has been changed, graphics have been overhauled, game mechanics are updated, and they have tried to make the game ""funner"" to play through the entire game. Below are some things that I did not hear or missed that they changed.Differences:- The camera angle seems to be slightly different which took me a while to get used to.- UI is reversed. The map is not on the bottom left and I swear it was on the right before.- Graphics look nice but are not as high res as I was expecting. When you zoom all the way in.... you start losing detail. Zoomed our or at a normal playable level the graphics are great.- First time playing you are given a choice between new to Civ or Civ VI. When I picked new to Civ VI it bumped the difficulty to Prince. I was surprised that I was playing at that high of a level because it reminded me a lot of Chieftain or Warlord from Civ V. Yes.. I don’t play on extremely hard. I like to enjoy the game... not want to violently and creatively curse at it like when I play Red Orchestra 2.- The standard civilizations you can play as. I was expecting them to change but I feel like I lost some that I loved. I did have all the expansions for Civ V so that may be why I feel it is lacking. I also hate that they will continue to have DLC for new civilizations but also understand. Wish they would give discounts toward the DLC if you purchased previous games.- Default Keyboard hot keys. They are changed. Space bar now does nothing....- Mouse controls seem to be slightly changed.- Side screen scrolling seems to be disabled when moving a unit. THIS IS REALLY ANOYING!Issues?I had one major issue. The game decided when I needed to go to bed. It didn’t ask me to save or quite, it just went away. The house was dark and the game allows for deep colors so insta crashing to the desktop which has a very bright background was surprising to say the least. I hope this was a fluke.Recommended?YES!

129,26.3,Not Recommended," October 22, 2017",3,"If you ae buying this as the next step from Civ V.... Don't. You'll be thoroughly disappointed.I usually ease myself into a game by starting with a couple of AIs and on the simplest settings. get to know the mechanics and then the next campaign pump up the difficulty, etc.I ended up playing 10 hours, running 4 senarios at the settler level, 4 different leaders, against AIs ranging from 3 to 7 opponents. I couldn't figure it out, after playing 600 hours of Civ V, I was expecting there to be some level of progression linking. I was wrong.- The AIs were schizophrenic in their actions, even at settler level, heaven forbid what the inequality boons are like at prince/king/immortal is like... I played against America in 3 scenarios, completely random personalities each time, its almost as if Rosavelt had a gandhi complex in one senario (the age old, ""lets all be friends!... and i'll nuke you"")- The game mechanic forces your playstyle towards domination due to the random nature of the AIs, if you dont keep a balenced policy tree and build a reasonable defence, you'll end up in generational wars you wont be able to keep up with or dominate the opponents... I personally dont want to be winning the game using domination every time, it would be nice to adapt to the situation once in a while.- Which takes me to the civic and science trees. if you are looking for a playstyle like civ 5, dont bother. there is little to no ability to adapt the game to your own playstyle or adapting your playstyle to victory conditions of certain leaders. for example; in Civ 5 you could rush to medieval era pushing through one line of science (usually i did through stonehenge, boosting faith, establishing a foothold.)... rushing through either of the tech trees will leave you at a great disadvantage... i then tried going through the science tree normally on two scenarios, boosted science in campuses, still ended up behind the other AIs in tech... I dont expect the game to be a cake-walk, however, this was at settler level.- The use of faith in this game is just half-arsed compared to Civ V. It hardly has any scope of boons. There is no UI toggle to view faith influence on cities (like when you are on a missionary or apostle) generally. accessing the faith purchasing is tedius, and im sure that unless it was pointed out to brand new players, they wouldnt know how to access it.- shortcut keys dont always work. I played this on 3 different PCs.... all three I had issues toggling yields (Y key) I can only assume its the game.- whats this with taking away build queues? ok, so due to the irritation of random AIs you need to change your builds often. but sometimes you have that city pottering along, pumping out stuff-the balance of amenities, housing and production focus is odd. there isnt a thoroughly explained section in the tutorial why housing and amenities are so important, and there isnt a quick explination as to what conditions you will lose if you dont have enough housing/amenities, without opening the civ wiki. I do think making larger housing and amenity icons on builds/tech tree items would be beneficial.What I do like- the concept of districts are good- the animation is very cartoony, but also very good quality, the graphics overall levels the playing field as opposed to Civ VReally, this game left me frustrated that I spent a hell of a lot of money for something i am really not going to play."
275,334.0,Not Recommended," December 11, 2016",3,"I have played Civ since I was in college and played way too many hours of the first version in my dorm room. I've played every mainline version of it since (but not the spinoffs) and It is probably my favorite game franchise of all time. I'm disappointed to report that Civ 6 has the seeds of some innovative ideas, but overall it is worst version of Civ I have yet played. I don't have too much to add to some well-written reviews already posted, but I would add a few points of emphasis.1. The AI in Civ VI is by far the worst AI in the history of the game. Computer players are absurdly, inexplicably incompetent when it comes to fighting wars, even at high levels of difficulty. An AI player may well show up at the doorstep of your city with a huge army, but upon attacking a majority of the units on any given turn won't do anything; by that I don't mean they don't do anything useful, I mean they literally sit there and skip their turn. If you attack them, individual units will usually run away, showing no sense of overall strategy of risk or sacrifice. Attacking an enemy city is the same: enemy units will act completely illogically.As other reviewers have noted, while the new system of diplomacy has interesting ideas, they are incompetently enacted by the AI. You can do everything right with another civilization, but after a certain point they will turn and declare war on you. At higher difficulties, the designers apparently made things tougher by making other civs less friendly, but it begins to make diplomacy seem superfluous- why bother with secret agendas and such if they are going to inexplicably change their mind and try to kill you at some point anyway?2. Civ 6 takes a big step backwards in terms of providing you clear information about your civ. How many different luxury resources do you have? In diplomacy, what trade routes do you already have, and for how much longer? What is the rate of population growth for your civ compared to the world? All these things, just for examples, are either difficult to ascertain or simply impossible without resorting to pen-and-paper notes. Older versions of Civ had many graphs and tables to figure such things out, but the new Civ 6 is simplified in a negative way. Even the Civilopedia is worse with fewer internal hotlinks. The bugaboo of Civ games has always been avoiding micro-management, but the designers have gone way too far the other way so that now you can't even figure out what is going on. They even took away one of my favorite moments of Civ: the post-game wrap-up. I loved reading my final stats compared to the world and watching the little timeline video of the history of the my game: all gone. Now there's just a few hard-to-read graphs and a final score.3. Count me amongst those who dislike Civ 6's use of roads. It is wrong conceptually and for game play.Instead of ""workers"", straight-forward units who have been making roads and improvements since Civ 1, there are now ""builders"" who instantly make improvements by using up a certain number of charges they have when created. And these builders don't make roads at all: these are made exclusively by trade caravans, who build them as they go from city to city. The idea of instantly built improvements I can take or leave- I suppose they address the problem of micro-management so you aren't constantly looking for something for workers to do. Being unable to direct where roads go or how quickly they are constructed, though, can be frustrating. If you want a road over a particular tile, or DON'T want a road there, it's tough luck. Why? This makes no sense to me conceptually- while trade caravans or their modern equivalent used roads, they rarely, if ever constructed them. According to one book I read (""World lit only by Fire""), the best roads of mideval Europe were still those built by the Romans 1000 years before, not by then-modern merchants.Then Civ 6 simply writes railroads out of existence, except as a technological concept that allows you to discover coal. Never mind this key time in the game of Civs 1-5 when you could begin to move units across a continent in a turn, or in history when railroads revolutionized trade and warfare. Instead everything is just a ""modern road"", as if the game was underwritten by a trade group of long-haul truckers. Similarly, there's no trade bonuses, now that I think about it, for being along waterways, never mind their historical significance as conduits of travel. These changes make Civ 6 seem dumber than its predecessors, rather than smarter.Otherwise, it's Civ, and it still sucks me in if I get started with it. The new graphics are beautiful, and the idea of districts that limit how a city can develop are appropriately innovative, even limiting how many wonders can be in a city which makes historical and game-play sense. Maybe the AI problems can be patched up, but I'm afeared that the Civ 6 developers at some point decided they just needed to get the game out the door and modders would make the game more playable over time. At this time, I can't recommend this game against its predecessors (Civ 4 remains my favorite) but hope it can improve over time."

26,231.8,Not Recommended," November 9, 2016",3,"They tried to do too much, without doing some things that would make sense.The UI is nice, the hubs are nice, the auto-roads with traders is nice, but the list gets short.Leveled up combat troops are overpowered. Layout restrictions is frustrating. Not being able to build wonders because of the jenky start location is maddening.Happiness was easier to manage than the balancing act of Housing/Amenities. That's if you can get any luxury items.Some bonus items should be luxury (Crabs are luxuries... think of real life. Who eats crab normally?)The lack of team ability at launch wrecked the whole game for me. I delight in playing with my friends, and them taking this out in the 11th hour constitutes fraud and make furious.Religion is beyond overpowered. I disable Religious Victory every time because every single time, within a few turns swarms (at one count, 15 at once) missionaries/apostles group in cities and get a quick victory. It takes away from actually planning your game.CONSTANT reconnections required from multi-player where players DeSync makes online play virtually impossible. It starts out once every few turns, but by around 1600AD, it was literally every turn someone would DeSync.A patch is sorely needed. I much prefer Civ5 right now. Sorry guys. Swing and a miss."
200,150.1,Recommended," October 25, 2016",3,"Positives:-The game looks fantastic-- and if you play on a crappy old piece of machinery like me, meaning graphics are hard, the Strategic View is actually a viable way to play the game. It is my preferred way to play.-The map is actually relevant to the game, in that you have to actually use it and do some proper land planning, instead of just spamming farms and mines.-The Wonders system makes Wonders much more unique than in other Civ games, with very specific requirements, leading to unique gameplay. Plus, there are a lot more of them.-The Inspirations and Eureka Moments sytem is great-- getting a huge boost towards developing a technology or an idea based on what you do in the game is a very smart move and, again, leads to large diversity of play.-Different playthroughs are not samey like they were in Civ V, given the unique way the tech/culture trees develop and the player is forced to use the map. I've found each playthrough unique and I value that.Negatives:-The game is too easy; not a complaint of mine, but one that I agree with, as Quill18 demonstrated a few days ago on Youtube when he beat it on Deity and doesn't think he deserved it. I don't think he did either.-The AI is actually trash. I did not believe it could get worse from Civ V. It did. I'm leaving this short and simple because if I listed all the ways the AI sucks right here this review would be way too long.Overall, I feel very positively about the game, especially given that, at release, it has a lot of room to be expanded upon. Remember, Civilization V at release was far different from Civilization V a year on, especially with all the DLC and updates. Civilization VI, whatever people think of it at release, is actually quite a good game if you give it a chance, and can only get better. Therefore, buy it in a year or two when you can get it and all the DLC for like $40."

179,167.1,Not Recommended," January 14, 2017",3,"Civ VI in short takes one step forward and three steps back; despite improving upon city development/management it shoots itself in the foot in other aspects such as diplomacy (seriously there is almost no point in trying), along with that it feels like the science tree is underwhelmingly small and lacking of depth in comparison to Civ V. Military is also a great example, despite the amazing feature of adding squadrons/combining units there seems to be a weird spurt in units, the gap between technologies in which you unlock any military is huge along with the fact that it feels like there aren't many units in the first place. This doubled with the fact that the AI seems to be very questionable, playing on King difficulty the enemy despite having more units decided to retreat and spend the entire time running circles in the ocean watching their capital burn. I heavily suggest going to Civ V until this game is optimized more."
3,977.6,Not Recommended," July 30, 2017",3,"There were many bugs on release that haven't been fixed.

The user interface is terribly designed. The quotes for techs almost mock them rather than being historical or thoughtful, some just stupid or make no sense. The voice narration is also not the most pleasant. I started with and enjoyed Civ V. This game has been extremely dissapointing. :("

Civ6 - sucide squads, AI just throws units at you without anny strategy.Dont kow if a bug or stupid AI, anyway its a problem: AI didnt repair pilaged tiles at all, even when builder was around.AI spams troops and does nothing with them - huge army of war elephands just chiling in the sea, moving few tiles forward and back.- some minor bugs (cant quit game properly)- annying unit control - slow auto selection of another unit (give order and at that moment unit switches and order is given to completely another unit)hope it will be fixed/improved, otherwise its just slighty better Civ5 - not worth 60 eu- AI city placemen, looks like AI has no strategy where to place a city, packing lots of citys just 3 tiles away from each other,what means that AI doesnt thinks about district placment at all.- no restar button to reseed map with yoor selected preset (its in the game code, just not added)- no ability to select the number of citystates when seting up the game- balance, starting city place is crucial, plains are useles, you grow fast but with small amount of production you cant manage the housing and amenity needs.

Been playing Civilization since CIV IV and it's nice to see Fraxis get back on it's feet from the abomination that is called Beyond Earth.Pros:-Let me start off by noting that the A.I. in 6 is far more enjoyable than it was in CIV 5. Getting declared war on for no reason is more less frequent(it still exists, but not to the extent of Civ 5).-With the explanation of agendas/hidden agendas it's cool to gauge the opinion of the A.I.-The introduction of two types of tech trees is great and creates for a more fluid playthrough-City districts is a huge step forward for this game and it's implementation has made this installment stand on it's own two feet-Barbarian A.I. is pretty awesome. The new invader system does create for some exciting/tense momentsCons:-The A.I. is still kind of dumb in terms of the other civilizations. There will be moments where the A.I. doesn't take advantage of your weaknesses(i.e. having a small army, being invaded by barbarians, having no walls, etc.) which does create some bland moments. On the other hand the Barbarian A.I. scares the living♥♥♥♥♥♥out of you when you first notice their scout and notice that your warriors are 20 tiles away and the impending attack by the barbians in 3 turns will wreck your♥♥♥♥♥♥ Maybe 2k should code the more violent civilations with the Barbarian A.I. to fix this-Culture victory is way too easy. If you spend the time making theaters, some wonders, and producing a lot of artists or muscians youll have this victory covered in no time.-Religion didn't change much from Civ 5 so...it's still kind of just there.-Barbaians still are ""barbarians"" after you've reached the 20th to 21st century.

But I catch myself thinking every now and then 'Is the pretty masking the substance?"".From a gameplay perspective, I really felt railroaded technologically. But that might be solved by expansions. But that's just the Firaxis way - the game is fundamentally missing pieces until they finish this cycle and release the next flawed basis game.Do I like the districts? Hell yes. Do I care enough to calculate how they work and therefore actually make use of the new system? Not at all. It just takes so much time and effort to think it through that I just cannot be bothered. Which makes it no different in outcome than the previous Civ games. A great concept, but so poorly done in terms of useability that it is worthless.As you can see, I'm conflicted by loving the new game, but not caring enough about what it does to make it actually worthwhile.

Been playing Civilization since CIV IV and it's nice to see Fraxis get back on it's feet from the abomination that is called Beyond Earth.Pros:-Let me start off by noting that the A.I. in 6 is far more enjoyable than it was in CIV 5. Getting declared war on for no reason is more less frequent(it still exists, but not to the extent of Civ 5).-With the explanation of agendas/hidden agendas it's cool to gauge the opinion of the A.I.-The introduction of two types of tech trees is great and creates for a more fluid playthrough-City districts is a huge step forward for this game and it's implementation has made this installment stand on it's own two feet-Barbarian A.I. is pretty awesome. The new invader system does create for some exciting/tense momentsCons:-The A.I. is still kind of dumb in terms of the other civilizations. There will be moments where the A.I. doesn't take advantage of your weaknesses(i.e. having a small army, being invaded by barbarians, having no walls, etc.) which does create some bland moments. On the other hand the Barbarian A.I. scares the living♥♥♥♥♥♥out of you when you first notice their scout and notice that your warriors are 20 tiles away and the impending attack by the barbians in 3 turns will wreck your♥♥♥♥♥♥ Maybe 2k should code the more violent civilations with the Barbarian A.I. to fix this-Culture victory is way too easy. If you spend the time making theaters, some wonders, and producing a lot of artists or muscians youll have this victory covered in no time.-Religion didn't change much from Civ 5 so...it's still kind of just there.-Barbaians still are ""barbarians"" after you've reached the 20th to 21st century. Fraxis at the very least call the future barbarians rebels or some♥♥♥♥♥♥-The spy system is also something youll forget you have.Overall, the game is good. It's far from being a masterpiece, but it's heading in the right direction.

14,334.9,Not Recommended," March 30, 2017",3,"The first match is the most enjoyable and interesting. Beyond that, the game loses all of its luster. It is diminished by repetitive gameplay which cannot be offset by changing any in-game variables. Even on deity, the AI is unchanging and simple. Which makes them easy to predict and manipulate, and causes the advantages given to them (via deity difficulty) almost irrelevant.However, if you do not like challenges, and prefer to sit and watch a few civilizations grow over the course of a few hours: then this is the game for you. An excellent Zen game to calm the nerves with accompanying instrumental classics. However, I humbly believe that $60.00 could be spent elsewhere for the same results."

The game is also very glitchy at the moment, my game will shut down at random point not allow me to open trade menus with other civs. This game is however still slightly better than civ 5 in some cases. The city states are much easier to manage and actually use to your benefit without much benefit. The unique perks of each civ is balanced pretty well with very cool stategic perks for each. However that game is 10x worse than civ 4, if you want a great civ game play civ 4 that game will knock your socks off if you have never played it."
426,129.2,Not Recommended, February 18,3,"Still isn't there yet. Added a whole lot of new features in the expansion, which makes up for the terrible lack of polish on the features in the base game (some things fixed by patches, lots of things not), but a lot of the new features are just as badly designed in the end. There's constant crap being thrown in your face every turn, such as unimportant rumors filling up the entire center of the screen and completely obscuring important events, while animated full-screen leader portraits will jibber at you and force you to click through multiple lines of dialogue multiple times a turn, sometimes while you're doing stuff and multiple times with every turn you want to progress through.Get a new spare luxury? Next turn 5 different jerks will want to offer you a bad deal for it, you're giving them all an audience and have to click through their talking and other garbage to continue the game. Get declared war on? Here's the three leaders that declared each jabbering at you and then a fourth one angry at you for being in a war, and, bonus, 50 nested notifications on the right side of the screen for all the city states that are now at war with eachother and everybody else. It's pretty easy to lose very valuable information in all the crap, I lose allied citystates all the time and I don't notice because there's always dozens of war declarations and other garbage coming up on the right hand corner and I'd have crippling RSI if I went through them all.AI still seems psychopathic as ever, though it's almost reasonable if you realize it's trying to win the game and not act like a civilization or a historical leader. It will go to war with you no matter how well liked you are, often joint wars with other allies of yours, and even in peace it will send trollish trade deals where it looks like a regular luxury-for-gold deal but then you scroll down on your side and it turns out it wants one of your cities. If you pull ahead in score enough, civilizations will start to declare war in a fruitless attempt to pull you down-- fruitless, because the 'tactical' AI is still utterly garbage. It doesn't take a military genius to utterly destroy a civilization with a superior military because they don't know how to use their units. Often they won't even show up, and you'll have to seek them out after they've declared war on you just to do a little damage and get a lucrative peace-deal out of the pointless war.They're okay at early wars when there's not a lot of units or many different types of units to work with, so you have to be really careful once you bump up the difficulty enough for the AI to even start to be challenging. Once you do that you can forget about getting any early wonders or a religion. If you can manage to get them you probably need to up the difficulty because the rest of it's going to be a cakewalk."

318,82.2,Recommended," January 8, 2017",3,"Best vanilla Civ I've played. Just one disclaimer, to those complaining about the diplomacy: If you play it like a typical 4x, chances are you'll make everyone hate you pretty quick. Think about how a real world kingdom would be viewed during the colonial era, if they were to build early, often and everywhere, right up to the borders of another empire. Do that, and other civilizations will see you as greedy expansionists who will surely come for their land in a matter of time, and of COURSE they'll hate you.Further, you have to take into account what each individual civilization's agendas are, as they go a long way towards dictating relations. I've been good friends with Greece for over 250 turns because I've stayed out of their back yard and haven't competed with them for city state attention. Meanwhile, Harald hates me because my navy is weak, and he respects a strong navy.I've had the AI actually come to ME with reasonable trade deals that are utterly reasonable, and accept reasonable offers from me... so long as they didn't hate or distrust me. So while I've seen some of the complaints on the diplomacy in Civ VI, I'm here to say that I personally haven't come across some issues, but it may be due to my unorthodox playstyle. (I play to enjoy the journey and ""roleplay"" more than I play to win.)I'll just address a couple points from a review that ALMOST made me avoid buying the game, as these are points where my actual experience showed something very different:CLAIM: AI CIVS WILL HATE YOU WHEN YOU'VE DONE NOTHING WRONGMY EXPERIENCE: This is generally due to the leader's Agendas, one of which is clearly visible on the diplomacy screen. Victoria is a colonizer and literally hates other civs just because she doesn't have a city on their contient. Essentially she distrusts (or is perhaps jealous...?) of nations who possess land she has no claim to.Likewise, Harald looks down on those with a weak navy, and Cleopatra those with a weak army. I've also heard complaints about being denounced simply because your government systems aren't the same, but look at how friendly nations in the real world will officially trash an element of the other's political process despite being on good terms. Denouncing another civ doesn't ALWAYS mean you loathe them, no matter how sour the expression of the leader.CLAIM: TRADE IS POINTLESS, THE AI EXTORTSMY EXPERIENCE: Recently, I was offered Open Borders for Open Borders by Cleopatra, and Victoria asked me for one of my two Mercury units in exchange for 5 gold per turn in the early game, 5 gold up front, and opening her borders to me. We weren't even on particularly friendly terms.CLAIM: YOU ARE DENOUNCED BY EVERY NATION FOR REFUSING TO ACCEPT PEACE WHEN ATTACKED. YOU CAN BE A WARMONGER WITHOUT EVER DECLARING WAR.MY EXPERIENCE: Tested it out and it does seem to be the case, but it's logical. I mean let's stop and think about it for a moment. You literally are.Think about how it would look in real life if one nation attacked another, got beaten up, then sued for peace, complete with offers to pay for damages incurred by the defender. Now imagine the defender said ""Nope, we're gonna use our defense as a casus belli to take everything from you."" It would be the definition of warmongering.No one in Civ VI holds being attacked against you. But once the attacker asks for peace, you're no longer under threat. There is no defense. Continuing to fight after that point means you become the aggressor, for no other reason than petty revenge. Throwing more lives - theirs as WELL as your own - into the line of fire because you were slighted by a rival would logically be seen as despicable by other world powers. Particularly if you use it for conquest.Hell, this is essentially Rome by definiton, and there's not a scholar in history who doesn't think Rome were warmongers."

And that easily means the best strategy game in 20 years!In my opinion. with the sole exception of 'Sid Meier's Civilization' of 1991 itself, 'even' Civilization projects seem to be far superior to 'odd' ones.'Civilization II' was just great - it still plays and even looks much better than many modern strategies!'Civilization III' had some interesting gameplay ideas, but terrible looks and tiny and colorless units and everything.'Civilizaition IV' featured excellent visuals, but stripping usual features in favor of separate add-ons was really a bad idea.'Civilization V' had the most innovations in the series, but here we again had a number of paid DLCs and addons - and that plain black style of the graphics and the interface was quite ugly for my taste.What I liked in 'Civilization VI':* The visuals. They are now as bright and cute as they had never been before! You feel as you'd want to lick the buildings and the units :)* The leaders. Yes, they are best-looking (and even almost historically true-looking) since, well, the first and probably the second game!* The completeness. No major feature is stripped down in the original vanilla edition, wow!* The districts. Great idea, actually - even if it is the only major innovation. Not just seeing a city growing randomly, but laying out its urbanizaton by hand is extremely satisfactory.:* The bugs, of course. Yes, it is a very big game, but it still could have been tested and proof-read better. I had my load of CTDs and freezes, and some Russian texts surely need some editing. Still, I have no complains of AI - some leaders are stupid, some are treacherous, some are plain weak. Just like in real-life politics, you know.* Some interface drawbacks. Where is the good old list of all my units?! I have a crowd of writers and painters who are waiting for the next amphitheatre to be built - and how am I supposed to find them scattered all over my little big empire?! And when Pericles declares a sudden war on me - how can I gather all my military who have not fought anything else than idling for many centuries? I am not even sure they will add it in future patches...* Well, this complain relates to every 'Civilization' game since II, but I would still love to see something like 'Palace' from 'Civilization I' or 'Throne Room' from 'Civilization II' again! Much better than just a boring statistics screen. And what about getting back screens with real people rioting or celebrating 'We love our Ruler' days?! Oh, forget it - they will never give us back that joy unfortunately.Of course, it would be blasphemy not to recommend 'Civilization VI' to everybody - especially if the bugs would be finally corrected!"

14,334.9,Not Recommended," March 30, 2017",3,"The first match is the most enjoyable and interesting. Beyond that, the game loses all of its luster. It is diminished by repetitive gameplay which cannot be offset by changing any in-game variables. Even on deity, the AI is unchanging and simple. Which makes them easy to predict and manipulate, and causes the advantages given to them (via deity difficulty) almost irrelevant.However, if you do not like challenges, and prefer to sit and watch a few civilizations grow over the course of a few hours: then this is the game for you. An excellent Zen game to calm the nerves with accompanying instrumental classics. However, I humbly believe that $60.00 could be spent elsewhere for the same results."
89,37.3,Recommended," October 20, 2016",3,"Runs very well even on my old and outdated computer. Lot's of new features are nice but there are a few gameplay mechanics that have been removed that will be missed. My biggest disappointment seems to be the decision to turn away from a realistic look to a more catoony one, but this isn't a huge deal when compared to the new gameplay mechanics added. It's very different to previous civ games, which is a good thing, but this means it'll take some adjusting even if you've played a lot of civ in your time. Overall my first impression of the game is positive. Will update as I get to know the game better though.EDIT 1: After playing for a few hours I can say I'm hooked. Can't wait for mod support"

It doesn't learn even the simplest of lessons. Many aspects of the game are very good. I like the city district development, although it takes way to long to build anything, whether unit, building or district. The builders being transient is good and the build speed is good but to little for how long it takes to build a builder. There are MANY MANY user enhancements out ther for CIV 5 and it seems that they did ZERO research on that when constructing Civ 6 to add some of those excellent feature MODS.

Splitting the tech tree into Purple and Blue paths does nothing but make each one more linear.AI is just ridiculous. They do not engage in anything after the Iron Age, and just stagnate. Civs will STILL randomly declare war on you or hate you for no reason. Diplomacy is completely monodimensional. There is no negotiation or communication. You can give them gold or not.Other Civs are monomaniacal and will base their entire interaction with you on whether or not you do one certain thing or not do that thing. If you have a big army, one Civ (the same one every time) will like you and another will not. It's always the same, it's always one dimensional, and after putting over 500 hours into Civ 5, it's nothing new.The Fog of War and map are hard to discern. The colors don't work. The graphics are cartoony and silly, without adding anything to the game. I can play it at 4k, which is nice, but still adds nothing.In fact, Civ 6 is nothing new.

I can't even bring myself to start another game given how many times I've played Civ 5, which I loved, and Civ 4, which I really liked. This whole endeavour reeks of money grubbing salesmanship. They take a venerated title like Civ, cut the budget as low as possible, make screenshots look cool and make a big deal out of simple features, and rely on the brand's past to sell the initial copies of a broken, incomplete game. After the initial influx of cash, the developers patch things that should have been done before release, and start the arduous process of squeezing out DLCs to further weaken your wallet, preying on your hope that the DLC will fix the game and make it what you know it should be.In summation, all fluff no substance, yet.

After investing hours of time into a game session, in midgame a crash will occur during the processing of the Civ AI's turns. The game crashes to the desktop. Any attempt to progress from a save game for that game session will crash in the same place, on the same turn. 2k/Firaxis are asking their customers to try various hardware techniques, some based on the operating system, some on graphics cards. It has been widely reported thru the 2k and Steam forums that this problem is widespread, and none of the techniques provided fixes the game stopping issue.This game is unplayable if you run into whatever AI routine is causing the game to crash. It might be several AI routines. 2k/Firaxis is not communicating any progress or when a patch can be expected.I consider the game currently unplayable beyond turn 150 to 250.

AI can declare wars against you constantly and suffer very few penalties. Even if you are in a denfensive war and take no cities you are labled a warmonger (though this decreases quickly if you take no cities) but if you take one city then dimplomacy is basically broken for the rest of the game. Even if they hate the person you took the city from, you will be denounced as a warmonger.Nation Diplomacy Interactions - Asking nations to stop spying, converting your cities, or settling near you is pointless. They might say they are stopping, but in reality they will break them all the time, constantly and without any recourse. You don't gain a casus belli, they don't take any diplomacy hit with other nations, nothing. Might as well not be in the game.War : Other nations AI is just plain stupid. You can pretty much take eveything with 5 or 6 troops as long as you balance them right. Once you have tanks and artillery, and corps and armies, you only need three, 2 artillery and an army of tanks (3 units stacked) and you can just go from city to city and take them all on anything but the last few difficulty levels. The AI hardly upgrades it units, runs away all the time. When they do actually attack they mill about round the outer edges of you city and are easily picked off by city defenses and ranged units.Units and Research - They have streamlined the units tree and not for the better. Its so short now you can get late game units to soon in the game. Research can be completed way to early. I am not a great player and have completely finished research in 1820s. I don't like the unit progression tress much either. They have only made small changes but those missing units have made a world of difference in how your units upgrade and the feel of travelling through the millennia.UI - Not great to be honest. Looks ok, functions less than well. Compared to the last versions of Civ 5 its a big step backwards. As an edge screen scroller its even worse. Mouse clicks unresponsive, hidden away functions and general poor layout. You get used to it, but doesn't make it good.Map generation : This is probably the biggest bugbear of mine. There is very little diveristy in maps through the options and when they are generated they look bland. Dont get me wrong, when a big city is built it looks great. I am talking about the landscape itself. there are far to few tile paints. You just get huge swathes of exactly the same tiles with no diversity at all. You now can't build wonders on mountain tiles either which is very disappointing and aesthetically displeasing. Mountains look good, but hills and especially rivers dont look great. Resources paints on maps also leave a lot to be desired. Some look good, some look awful, a right mixed bag.Resources - Unit upgrade/build (strategic) resources have been fundamentally changed. When they spawn, good luck finding them and anywhere close to your civ. I have seen 3 continents without coal at all. Really? Thats like Europe and Russia having no coal at all in the real world??Good news is they will fix the majority of these ""features"" if passed games are anything to go by. Its an average release which will become more annoying the more you play. I have over 1000 hours played on Civ 5, it will take a fair bit of patching until I will get that many hours with this game."

So I would not have written a review beeing not sure what to think, but considering their current business model it needs to be said."
65,217.9,Not Recommended," December 9, 2017",3,"Even though I've been playing Civ VI for a good many hours now, I still continue to feel let down by the direction they've taken with this rendition of the series. Had this been some other game or even just Civilization Revolutions 3, I might have felt very different about this, but this is Civilization - a game series Ive played since my childhood and through three decades.There are some improvements - like the way workers/builders now function, the casus belli implementation and splitting up cultural and scientific progression. But the AI interaction (despite the supposed addition of complex motives) feels anaemic and the concept of traders being the (only) ones that construct roads is outright bizarre. Not to mention that progression seems way off, with the final ages passing by so fast you can scarcely mobilize the features they add before they've become technologically obsolete even on the slowest game speed.But above anything else, what really disappointed me was that it has lost the -feel- of ruling a nation through history as it epically unfolds. Sure, Civilization was never truly realistic, but it could still immerse you into history like it was. And not the least did the game respect history, presenting cultures, wonders and achievements with reverence, often inspiring you to want to learn more.Now it's all humorous, oversaturated. cartoonish visuals and the quotes you are presented are most often just goofy tongue in cheek remarks. And time and time again gameplay design completely ignore the call for conceivability that's fundamental to immersion, like the unfolding of the cities to spread them out across the entire country, with wonders that take up the same amount of land as the city centre itself, and science districts relying on being close to mountains (!). How many actual, real top universities would qualify for that bonus? Certainly it solves some gameplay balance issues of prior renditions, but there are better ways to do that (many Civ V mods could serve as excellent examples).Of course I've been spoiled with the expansions and many mods for Civ V (I cannot recommend the Community Balance Patch enough), but what saddens me is that with the concerns listed above, Civ VI seems beyond saving. I just hope this rendition of the series will be a detour and Civ VII will get the series back on track."
101,43.2,Not Recommended, January 24,7,"I held off on getting Civ VI for an extremely long time due to the negative reviews, but finally decided it was time to dive into it when Humble Bundle offered it for a mere $12, with two free DLC's added in.TL;DR: I think it improves on a lot from Civ V, and yet simultaneously feels like an over all down grade from Civ V. I think even Beyond Earth is a better installment of the franchise. I do think it's fun, however, but only recommend getting it on a huge sale, like humble bundle, and otherwise don't think it's priced fairly for what you get (especially with the new Rise and Fall DLC costing $$$ to fix the game).I'm hoping that the new expansion, Rise and Fall, resolves a lot of its short comings, but at the same time I shouldn't have to pay nearly the entire price of the game again just to ""fix"" it. Anyway below I'm going to highlight just a couple of what I feel are the biggest pros and cons.CONS:- Personally, I'm really not a fan of the cartoon art style. It makes me feel less immersed in the game, and making a historical strategy game feel completely unrealistic seems like a contradiction. This is really down to taste, but this really feels like a downgrade visually from Civ V.- Everyone's been saying it, but the AI really is terrible. As you can see I haven't played much so far, but in my second playthrough, being as peaceful as you can possibly be, I have all but two civilisations about to declare war with me for the most ridiculous reasons. Explore too much of the map? Denounced! Build too many wonders? Denounced! Have a different government type? Denounced! It feels unrealistic and its often hypocritical, childish, and just contributes to the silly cartoonish feel. To me, this is the #1 biggest issue mechanically with the game.- As far as I can tell there's no united nations in the game, nor is there the possibility of a diplomatic victory, which was always my favourite victory in Civ V. I'm pretty disappointed with this. To essentially replace it with a religious victory seems like yet another huge downgrade. I for one really don't like the religious victory idea, it just doesn't make sense to me.PROS:- The new district system is fantastic, and I absolutely love the feeling of building my city on more than one tile. I think it's extremely well done and intuitive and a step in the right direction.- I like a lot of the new wonders and leaders, and I ilke that the leaders have their own abilities now.- The combat style, with flanking, is a nice addition, and the animations for combat I think are quite well done as well.- I like the separate culture and technology trees, and I like the new government system.- There's a much better ui system for managing your religion, which is a nice feature, and I like the new religious units for the most part, although like Civ V religions can become extremely frustrating to manage, especially later in the game.Disclaimer: I haven't played long, obviously, so these are my initial impressions. Hence also why I kept this brief. I hope it was helpful! Over all I have to say no, in large part because it just doesn't feel like an upgrade from Civ V, and it really isn't worth the money -- but if you get it heavily discounted like I did, I do think it's decent fun, despite its flaws!"

158,140.5,Not Recommended," October 28, 2016",3,"Edit: for people looking at the digital deluxe package I do not find that 2K lived up to the promises of either content or savings. Because after the sales and discounts for DLC as well as the content included in them I would have been better suited to buy a la carte. This is my reason for going from a positive to a negative reccomendation, while the game is OK I can no longer feel this is worth the value.This is not your grandfather's civilization. This is the biggest evolution that Civ has seen yet. Gone are the old tried and true tactics that work in all situations. With Civ 5 they unstacked your armies creating tactical combat, with Civ 6 they unstacked cities creating tactical city development. The new inspiration/eureka system allows a player to strategically develop in a method that advances sciences and policy evolving gameplay even more.Debates over the cartoony art style are petty and irrelevant because it was designed to make the map more readable, and it achieves that. Though the UI and options could use some updating it is not unusable when the player learns to read it and redefines a few hotkeys. Becoming accompanied with the new lenses views helps with this.On city growth this is the biggest change and one that everyone must learn to adapt to. No longer can a player just decide that every city is a build everything one stop production facility. In part because of the new district system that forces players to focus each city in what they geography is suited for, and in the other part because you no longer have the time to really build everything with abandon. You actually can make mistakes that later on can cause you regrets. Learning to read the land and plan each city in advance proves to be a most important skill.Government and policies are a new feature that replaces the pre-existing civics system of just leveling up features of your civilization. Now you must pick and choose how your society operates and one choice must come over another, not just the constant improvement without any real mistakes possible.Religious combat adds a new level to gameplay offering tactical religious spread and defense. There is even a promotion for your religious units that can aid your standard combat units.Espionage has altered and takes a small amount of management but this allows for targeted missions and benefits. You can again steal and sabotage and you can now steal great works.Great people are now more individual offering varying differences that each civilization must compete for. One great scientist may give you science inspirations while another builds a university and another improves all your science buildings. These variations apply to all the versions of great people.Diplomacy has been improved offering all the old options and a few new effects like causus beli and information levels allowing you to peak into the motives and activities of your opponents. The new system used in regards to city states offers improved benefits for being their ally (now called suzerain) with the offset that it is more difficult to be everyone's friend. Your resource to secure them is how many envoys you can generate with them and not an object that you can buy with infinite cash. Suzerain bonuses are also unique to each city state so far and depending on how you play can be spectacular.The game plays at a much faster speed than previous versions allowing for people to complete a game sooner, personally I play on epic speed (50% longer game(I think it is actually 100% longer)) to help maintain the speed I am used to. It also offers some scenario mods for fast play multiplayer games.Overall this is a much deserved improvement to the series and the designers achieved a sincere effort on making the game more accessible for fans of the series. The UI features do make for more management in large games due to lack of automation utilities (though if you are automating everything you are missing out on the point of games like this anyways). The player will find the UI counter intuitive if they are coming out of previous Civ games and will need to learn to adapt. Some information is not clearly labeled in a numerical representation that avid gamers desire to make calculations. Players must now make decisions and choosing may result in hind sighted regrets giving each choice more impact as the game progresses. Almost all core mechanics have been improved and stability is strong and noticeable bugs are low.TLDR: Do not do that, this was written for a reason."

131,235.3,Not Recommended," December 6, 2016",3,"At the moment I wouldn't recommend the game.It is enjoyable until the fundamentaly bad AI becomes all to pervasive.Its great the way the have included parts of different DLCs into the main game, but then have written such appalling AI that they don't work properly.Main parts of the game that really don't work properly are :Religion - The AI gets so much piety that it can spawn continual religeous units when even if you build wonders and holy districts, you are struggling to recruit enough to keep your lands safe.Warmongering - Only way to not get everyone to dislike and denounce you is never go to war, or be attacked yourself. AI can declare wars against you constantly and suffer very few penalties. Even if you are in a denfensive war and take no cities you are labled a warmonger (though this decreases quickly if you take no cities) but if you take one city then dimplomacy is basically broken for the rest of the game. Even if they hate the person you took the city from, you will be denounced as a warmonger.Nation Diplomacy Interactions - Asking nations to stop spying, converting your cities, or settling near you is pointless. They might say they are stopping, but in reality they will break them all the time, constantly and without any recourse. You don't gain a casus belli, they don't take any diplomacy hit with other nations, nothing. Might as well not be in the game.War : Other nations AI is just plain stupid. You can pretty much take eveything with 5 or 6 troops as long as you balance them right. Once you have tanks and artillery, and corps and armies, you only need three, 2 artillery and an army of tanks (3 units stacked) and you can just go from city to city and take them all on anything but the last few difficulty levels. The AI hardly upgrades it units, runs away all the time. When they do actually attack they mill about round the outer edges of you city and are easily picked off by city defenses and ranged units.Units and Research - They have streamlined the units tree and not for the better. Its so short now you can get late game units to soon in the game. Research can be completed way to early. I am not a great player and have completely finished research in 1820s. I don't like the unit progression tress much either. They have only made small changes but those missing units have made a world of difference in how your units upgrade and the feel of travelling through the millennia.UI - Not great to be honest. Looks ok, functions less than well. Compared to the last versions of Civ 5 its a big step backwards. As an edge screen scroller its even worse. Mouse clicks unresponsive, hidden away functions and general poor layout. You get used to it, but doesn't make it good.Map generation : This is probably the biggest bugbear of mine. There is very little diveristy in maps through the options and when they are generated they look bland. Dont get me wrong, when a big city is built it looks great. I am talking about the landscape itself. there are far to few tile paints. You just get huge swathes of exactly the same tiles with no diversity at all. You now can't build wonders on mountain tiles either which is very disappointing and aesthetically displeasing. Mountains look good, but hills and especially rivers dont look great. Resources paints on maps also leave a lot to be desired. Some look good, some look awful, a right mixed bag.Resources - Unit upgrade/build (strategic) resources have been fundamentally changed. When they spawn, good luck finding them and anywhere close to your civ. I have seen 3 continents without coal at all. Really?

101,43.2,Not Recommended, January 24,7,"I held off on getting Civ VI for an extremely long time due to the negative reviews, but finally decided it was time to dive into it when Humble Bundle offered it for a mere $12, with two free DLC's added in.TL;DR: I think it improves on a lot from Civ V, and yet simultaneously feels like an over all down grade from Civ V. I think even Beyond Earth is a better installment of the franchise. I do think it's fun, however, but only recommend getting it on a huge sale, like humble bundle, and otherwise don't think it's priced fairly for what you get (especially with the new Rise and Fall DLC costing $$$ to fix the game).I'm hoping that the new expansion, Rise and Fall, resolves a lot of its short comings, but at the same time I shouldn't have to pay nearly the entire price of the game again just to ""fix"" it. Anyway below I'm going to highlight just a couple of what I feel are the biggest pros and cons.CONS:- Personally, I'm really not a fan of the cartoon art style. It makes me feel less immersed in the game, and making a historical strategy game feel completely unrealistic seems like a contradiction. This is really down to taste, but this really feels like a downgrade visually from Civ V.- Everyone's been saying it, but the AI really is terrible. As you can see I haven't played much so far, but in my second playthrough, being as peaceful as you can possibly be, I have all but two civilisations about to declare war with me for the most ridiculous reasons. Explore too much of the map? Denounced! Build too many wonders? Denounced! Have a different government type? Denounced! It feels unrealistic and its often hypocritical, childish, and just contributes to the silly cartoonish feel. To me, this is the #1 biggest issue mechanically with the game.- As far as I can tell there's no united nations in the game, nor is there the possibility of a diplomatic victory, which was always my favourite victory in Civ V. I'm pretty disappointed with this. To essentially replace it with a religious victory seems like yet another huge downgrade. I for one really don't like the religious victory idea, it just doesn't make sense to me.PROS:- The new district system is fantastic, and I absolutely love the feeling of building my city on more than one tile. I think it's extremely well done and intuitive and a step in the right direction.- I like a lot of the new wonders and leaders, and I ilke that the leaders have their own abilities now.- The combat style, with flanking, is a nice addition, and the animations for combat I think are quite well done as well.- I like the separate culture and technology trees, and I like the new government system.- There's a much better ui system for managing your religion, which is a nice feature, and I like the new religious units for the most part, although like Civ V religions can become extremely frustrating to manage, especially later in the game.Disclaimer: I haven't played long, obviously, so these are my initial impressions. Hence also why I kept this brief. I hope it was helpful! Over all I have to say no, in large part because it just doesn't feel like an upgrade from Civ V, and it really isn't worth the money -- but if you get it heavily discounted like I did, I do think it's decent fun, despite its flaws!"

I mean, vanilla Civ 5 didn't even have things like religion and espionage!I really like Civ 6, and I think it that it's a step in the right direction for the franchise.

Currently though I find myself not very enthusiastic about finishing up my games. Some of the concepts are interesting- split trees for tech/civics, districts, and governments but overall the game feels clunky and flat to me.The AI is horrible just spams units and attacks regardless of civ strength. Diplomacy is not well scripted- you release a conquered civ just to have them denounce you for warmongering.Many notification/options from Civ5 and not in game creating a huge quality of life issue. No sentry mode for units meaning you have to continually scan the board for incoming units/barbarians EACH turn. Not horrible when you have a small empire but the drudgery increases and your country increases. In addition- no city can attack alert. Again making you have to scan around for threats each turn.you currently cannot move or demolish districts. the UI is horrible with missing tooltips and the help screens are anything but helpful.Wait for a few patches maybe a DLC and the pick it up on sale. I hope to return back to the game after the fix some issues but until that time I cannot recommend"
31,41.6,Not Recommended, January 21,3,"I love the civilization franchise, but this game is not as addictive as CIV V. I struggle to find any motivation to finish games. There are just too many features to think about. The research and policy tree are the same thing, progression is very slow, units are slow to move around, roads are not really part of the gameplay, the game needs a lot of planning ahead and optimization is only possible if you basically have the end game layout of your city in mind. You can´t change up your strategy based on how the game goes. It all feels too straightforward. Diplomacy is more transparent, but the different leader preferences just make it impossible to live in peace. Wars are not viable because of the diplomatic penalties. Religion is just a pain and has almost no purpose. The AI also does not play smarter in higher difficulties, but simply has more advantages.I thought the districts would be a really cool thing and they are, but the map feels so clumped up in the end game."

65,217.9,Not Recommended," December 9, 2017",3,"Even though I've been playing Civ VI for a good many hours now, I still continue to feel let down by the direction they've taken with this rendition of the series. Had this been some other game or even just Civilization Revolutions 3, I might have felt very different about this, but this is Civilization - a game series Ive played since my childhood and through three decades.There are some improvements - like the way workers/builders now function, the casus belli implementation and splitting up cultural and scientific progression. But the AI interaction (despite the supposed addition of complex motives) feels anaemic and the concept of traders being the (only) ones that construct roads is outright bizarre. Not to mention that progression seems way off, with the final ages passing by so fast you can scarcely mobilize the features they add before they've become technologically obsolete even on the slowest game speed.But above anything else, what really disappointed me was that it has lost the -feel- of ruling a nation through history as it epically unfolds. Sure, Civilization was never truly realistic, but it could still immerse you into history like it was. And not the least did the game respect history, presenting cultures, wonders and achievements with reverence, often inspiring you to want to learn more.Now it's all humorous, oversaturated. cartoonish visuals and the quotes you are presented are most often just goofy tongue in cheek remarks. And time and time again gameplay design completely ignore the call for conceivability that's fundamental to immersion, like the unfolding of the cities to spread them out across the entire country, with wonders that take up the same amount of land as the city centre itself, and science districts relying on being close to mountains (!). How many actual, real top universities would qualify for that bonus? Certainly it solves some gameplay balance issues of prior renditions, but there are better ways to do that (many Civ V mods could serve as excellent examples).Of course I've been spoiled with the expansions and many mods for Civ V (I cannot recommend the Community Balance Patch enough), but what saddens me is that with the concerns listed above, Civ VI seems beyond saving. I just hope this rendition of the series will be a detour and Civ VII will get the series back on track."

15,71.4,Not Recommended," January 3, 2017",3,"I've played the Civ franchise since the 2nd edition, and had high hopes for Civ 6. After all, there has not yet been an iteration that wasn't an improvement upon the previous game. Sadly, the devs either over thought this offering, or didn't bother showing it to anyone before they went live. My complaints aren't numerous, but taken as integral to the user experience, they're fatal:1) The interface is chaotic, monotone, and inefficient. Looking at a bustling game board replete with trivial, oversized and overlapping icons gives me vertigo. The fog of war/fog of exploration seems like a realistic improvement, but the layer ends up adding more busy-ness to an already crowded screen.2) Executing diplomacy and finding information on other civs or city states is onerous (not impossible). I'd expect this from a Europa game or others engineered towards well, engineers, but in a Civ game simplicity has been and should remain king. Every time you have a conversation with another Civ, not only are you forced to say Goodbye, additionally you have to click X to exit.3) The AI is TERRIBLE. Just TERRIBLE. No amount of coercion, backstabbing, aggressiveness or demands after early-mid game can trigger a war. Other Civs are spineless for the remainder of the game after losing an initial war.All told, from the first hour of play I had a niggling doubt in my head that said ""Okay, its weird, but keep plugging away, it will get good."" It never did. By the fourth restart with different settings, I'd completely lost interest."

One good example is, I launched a war to liberate England, including their capital. What did I get for it? Everyone denoucning me, including England. Moreover, they will denounce you and then try and trade with you the very next turn. It's almost as if it was late on a Friday for the dev team and they just ""went with it as is.""2) Game is simply too slow in the latter ages. Even with cities that have a strong industrial focus, it takes way too long to build anything. It shows with the AI. Their armies are typically very small, which makes the game boring. Most wars are over too fast, because no one can afford to build enough.3) No United Nations? This seems like a major oversight, as it plays a big role in Civ 5. Half of the reason to get city states on your side is lost.4) If you lose the game, you'll never know why. It simply pops up and says....you lose, game over. No stats, or details behind why you lost. Unbelieveable.5) Religion is TERRIBLE. I disable religious victories. All you do is spam as many apostles and missionaries as you can...all over the world. That's it. Relgion should go back to what it was, a branch of culture.All of this drives the game into one simple direction.....war. It's way too easy to just roll over everyone.

158,140.5,Not Recommended," October 28, 2016",3,"Edit: for people looking at the digital deluxe package I do not find that 2K lived up to the promises of either content or savings. Because after the sales and discounts for DLC as well as the content included in them I would have been better suited to buy a la carte. This is my reason for going from a positive to a negative reccomendation, while the game is OK I can no longer feel this is worth the value.This is not your grandfather's civilization. This is the biggest evolution that Civ has seen yet. Gone are the old tried and true tactics that work in all situations. With Civ 5 they unstacked your armies creating tactical combat, with Civ 6 they unstacked cities creating tactical city development. The new inspiration/eureka system allows a player to strategically develop in a method that advances sciences and policy evolving gameplay even more.Debates over the cartoony art style are petty and irrelevant because it was designed to make the map more readable, and it achieves that. Though the UI and options could use some updating it is not unusable when the player learns to read it and redefines a few hotkeys. Becoming accompanied with the new lenses views helps with this.On city growth this is the biggest change and one that everyone must learn to adapt to. No longer can a player just decide that every city is a build everything one stop production facility. In part because of the new district system that forces players to focus each city in what they geography is suited for, and in the other part because you no longer have the time to really build everything with abandon. You actually can make mistakes that later on can cause you regrets. Learning to read the land and plan each city in advance proves to be a most important skill.Government and policies are a new feature that replaces the pre-existing civics system of just leveling up features of your civilization. Now you must pick and choose how your society operates and one choice must come over another, not just the constant improvement without any real mistakes possible.Religious combat adds a new level to gameplay offering tactical religious spread and defense. There is even a promotion for your religious units that can aid your standard combat units.Espionage has altered and takes a small amount of management but this allows for targeted missions and benefits. You can again steal and sabotage and you can now steal great works.Great people are now more individual offering varying differences that each civilization must compete for. One great scientist may give you science inspirations while another builds a university and another improves all your science buildings. These variations apply to all the versions of great people.Diplomacy has been improved offering all the old options and a few new effects like causus beli and information levels allowing you to peak into the motives and activities of your opponents. The new system used in regards to city states offers improved benefits for being their ally (now called suzerain) with the offset that it is more difficult to be everyone's friend. Your resource to secure them is how many envoys you can generate with them and not an object that you can buy with infinite cash. Suzerain bonuses are also unique to each city state so far and depending on how you play can be spectacular.The game plays at a much faster speed than previous versions allowing for people to complete a game sooner, personally I play on epic speed (50% longer game(I think it is actually 100% longer)) to help maintain the speed I am used to. It also offers some scenario mods for fast play multiplayer games.Overall this is a much deserved improvement to the series and the designers achieved a sincere effort on making the game more accessible for fans of the series. The UI features do make for more management in large games due to lack of automation utilities (though if you are automating everything you are missing out on the point of games like this anyways). The player will find the UI counter intuitive if they are coming out of previous Civ games and will need to learn to adapt. Some information is not clearly labeled in a numerical representation that avid gamers desire to make calculations. Players must now make decisions and choosing may result in hind sighted regrets giving each choice more impact as the game progresses. Almost all core mechanics have been improved and stability is strong and noticeable bugs are low.TLDR: Do not do that, this was written for a reason."

You don't even need to field a big army to go for domination.If you're a returning Civ player you may want to play at a higher level of difficulty (at least two or three ranks above the difficulty you're used to playing Civ V) otherwise the game will feel like you're playing on Settler difficulty.To sum things up Civ 6 brings some nice additions like the Eureka system, districts and nations and leaders that are new to the series (although I don't know why they chose an Italian who never held the crown in her name and is better known for authorising the massacre of French Protestants in one of the most notorious events in French history as the leader for France).It's a pity really because some additions are pretty good but as long as they don't improve the AI as a returning Civ player you're better off playing Civ V Brave New World, Beyond Earth Rising Tide or (if you don't mind the older graphics) Civ 4 Beyond the Sword."

1,679.3,Recommended," November 23, 2016",96,"Civilization VI is an interesting game, it released with more content than Civ V did, it has new mechanics that allow more customization to your empire, and it still keeps that same feeling of ""one more turn."" I was frustrated by Civ Beyond Earth, from technical bugs to issues with progression, maybe because it was foreign to me I just couldn't get into it in the way I expected. I still had some of that anxiety going into Civ 6, maybe it wouldn't be the game I wanted it to be, that it would be a step backwards from Civ V which is one of my favorite games of all time.I think Civ 6 has the bones to be the best Civ yet, every aspect has some new level of depth or thought put into it, from great people having unique bonuses, to limiting the typical wonder spamming cities by requiring tile placement of wonders, to city state bonuses being more unique and having that race for Suzerain. I love when you find a great spot for a district with huge adjacency bonuses, setting up a great holy site or harbor really feels better than just adding a building to a production queue.That said, there is still a lot of frustration for me as a classic Civ gamer, barbarian encampments that spawn high damage horsemen or ranged ships within the first 20 turns, movement penalties being changed from Civ V, some unit autocycling problems, and even AI bugs like not upgrading or spamming too much of one type of unit. I think most of those faults are overlooked by the core of the game being much deeper. Along this line, the first fall patch to Civ 6 addressed many issues, and has me excited for future updates to improve quality of life for the game.Also, as a new father, Civ 6 is one of the few games I can play while holding my baby. I often play with the steam controller so that I can set up all the mouse actions to be controlled by one hand while I cradle the baby in my other arm.If I had to recommend one Civ game to a newcomer, I’d say you can’t beat Civ 5 with all the DLC, it has everything I love about civ and isn’t working through any bugs or UI issues, but if you have played Civ before, Civ 6 is a great addition to the series and I can’t wait to see what more they bring to the table."

97,7.8,Not Recommended," July 3, 2017",4,"If you came to play this game looking for a brilliant follow-up to Civilization V..... I really, honestly can't recommend it.For individuals who enjoy heavy micromanagement, a much more difficult gameplay, and balancing their resources intelligently and with potentially great amounts of sacrifice, this game is for them. The management and diffiiculty *of* that management has been cranked up to 11 with the introduction of districts and with the necessity of placing certain buildings (namely Wonders) on their own slot, it makes you have to think very hard about where you build, because you are going to have to sacrifice things like city size for production, and housing amounts for money, and entire swaths of farming space for one district or wonder (in particular the ones that must be placed in extremely specific areas).But that's not all. The changes they have made to the game's UI makes it highly unintuitive, I have yet to find how to check and manage one's army at *all*, the pathing seems to have lost in intelligence, your AI's IQ seems to be on the level of a poorly educated goldfish, builders now can only perform three actions before being used up (but at least they do it instantly rather than taking time.... although I prefered it the other way around), housing and population growth is an absolute *crisis* at times due to needing to manage it by the world around (trust me: this is one game where your 'one city challenge' is going to *REALLY* be a challenge!), familiar commands have gone completely by the wayside and the game's education system doesn't seem to be helpful toward them (I don't want to have to go to Google to find out how to build roads; I would like if the game itself taught me how to do so), and they have removed the ability to create an 'Archapelago' world, thus no longer allowing for a land of islands for those with the pirate blood (""Arrr!"").And all this can be yours for the stunning price of.... $80?!For sandboxers, casual gamers, relaxed players, and people who like their AI to have some intuitiveness, I would recommend sticking with Civilization V until they make some fixes to this one (if they do). For its price, I simply cannot recommend this game; it is too expensive for something that is not worth the price of admission. Buy it only when it's on sale, and not for a penny more. I did not enjoy the game anywhere near as much as I hoped I would, and I don't foresee it becoming a game that I could play casually with the rabid drive that Civ V can take me to.The game isn't all bad. For people who like their game more intense, prefer the challenge of a heavy resource management game, are willing to overlook the painful AI, and have spreadsheets to spare, this game can be fantastic. Depending on how you build, you can develop much more strongly and more directly toward any particular type of win that you're looking for. From war districts to trade districts to religious districts, micromanagement in this game is absolutely *key*. Unfortunately, I am not one of these players, and for that reason, I have to say: ""Firaxis, your game needs some work.""*ESPECIALLY* in the menu area."

They AI's strategic means of warfare is no improvement from previous titles. They practically suicide units onto your own. This can technically be seen as one of the 'actual' problems with AI. (Even though generals in history never suicided troops... *sarcasm*)The AI higher difficulties basically makes them cheat more.Again, this is true. They've done this in previous titles and never improved the AI to perform better and rather just supplement the higher difficulties. (Again, this is nothing new)In general, think more about what issue you have with this game. If these issues stem from you not winning or having a 'personally' bad time, then it's on you, not the game. If 10,000 people find a game fun, and 1 person doesn't, It doesn't mean the game is or isn't fun. It just means that what you're saying it completely driven by Bias, not factual evidence.It's a flawed game, but it is a civilzation game and it's improved a lot upon what Civ 5 was, whilst still adding it's own twist so it isn't just 'Civ 5 2.0'.My issues with this game stem from the DLC marketing, minor glitches and the typically 'cheaty' higher difficulties.People forget multiplayer has mods again, everyone wanted that back since Civ 4..."

I bought a new computer just so I could play this game. I paid more for this game than I did for any other game over two years.It wasn't worth it.Civilization VI makes a handful of interesting and enjoyable changes to the near-perfection that was Civ5, while introducing a host of new changes that ruin the game's overall experience. The parallel tech and policy trees are a nice idea, as are the boosts. The loading times are the actually the worst of any Civ, including Civilization on the SNES. The district system is stupid and unnecessary, as is requiring each wonder to be built on its own tile. These can't be torn down, by the way, so think twice before building Stonehenge. The worst offense by far is the mandatory game limit of 500 turns, which as far as I can tell can't be disabled, even if Score Victory is turned off. If the game ends at 500 turns no matter what, then what's the point of disabling the Score Victory? Why does Firaxis feel the need to enforce a 500 turn limit? What's the point?Ultimately Civ6 doesn't make any positive, meaningful changes to what Civ5 did very well. There are some nice, cool touches, and a lot more stupid and frustrating touches, including the main change of the district system. If you really liked Civ5, don't buy this game.

They changed the resource system they had in Civ 5, as an example in Civ 5 if you had iron in your borders it gave you an amount when you mouse over it, in Civ 6 you only get one of that resource which means you have to waste tiles on resources, wonders, and districts.Here are my pros and consPros: Improved interface (in my opinion),better combat animation,gets rid of the social policy system from Civ 5 and replaces it with ""Civics"" (not Honda),ability to combine units to make a corps and army for land units besides the SAM launchers,better diplomacy, actual leader animation,better settlement recommendations,Cons: Completly♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥the unit movement system and unfuqulating swift and easy unit movement (I cannot move armies quick enough when at war or fighting barbarians),The♥♥♥♥♥♥of the Workers (they replaced the Worker unit with the builder. The Worker in Civ 5 had unlimited uses while the Builder unit in Civ 6 only has 3 uses per unit),Changing and♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥the resource system that I loved in Civ 5 as I taked about above,at random times while playing a singleplayer game about 2-3 civs will start an alliance and declare war against you which means you must always have a large and powerful military at all times (alliance wars can happen more than once),the district system which you need certain districts to build certain things like buildings and wonders and having to waste tiles and gold for districts and wonders,3 Greek civs in the game,No ability to play singleplayer scenarios,The new happiness system which makes you build stuff in cities that give you more ""Housing"" and ""Amenities"" to make your citizens happy then the system in Civ 5 where you could actually see what your current happiness was and you could build things and imporrve resources to fix,No Golden Ages,Needing the ""Militarty Engineer"" unit to build roads (only has 2 uses per unit) other than the Militarty Engineer the only other unit that can make roads is the Trader which builds a road on the tile it walks to when on a trade mission,So other than all of that I like this game. For the current add on content they all have negative reviews because people are expecting an add on like Gods and Kings or Brave New World for Civ 5. The only add on's out for Civ 6 are civ/scenario packs which were also released for Civ 5.The problem with the add on's for this game is that people are expecting too soon for a major add on like BNW. 2K did the same thing with Civ 5 for add on's. Between the release of Civ 5 and Gods and Kings there were civ/scenario packs which people didn't complain about then, the same thing is happening now but people are comlpaining about it for no reason.You should get this game, it's a good game to play when trying to pass time. Don't let the negative reviews for the add on's fool you, just look at Civ 5!"

305,129.1,Not Recommended," October 28, 2016",4,"I wish I could give it a 1/2 a thumb. It is fun, and I've logged 36hrs (320 turns) as chinese. But it has quite a few flaws and missing elements that have always been part of the franchise. Such as lack of shortcut keys to toggle resource and yield displays, unable to rename cities, lack of detailed screens such as list of poosible trade routes like in V, lack of diplomacy options, leaders are kind of prosaic and lack personality/emotion (you can demand a city or gift them one and their facial expression never changes or do they say anything). I like the realistic art of V better but I dont hate the whimsical new art. With a FREE expansions/update or some expert modding this game could be worth $60. I have a friend who has never played a CIV game wanting to buy it. I told him to save his money and buy CIV V for a fraction of the price with all the expansions and dlc included.So yes, CIV 6 is a fun game and I'll probably keep playing it for a while but like a lot of other people have said it does not feel finished.I bought this on release date. It's since been updated to address some of the original issues. But my overall opinion of the game is still mostly negative. Now that the new game smell has worn off it kind of stinks. Civ 5 had me convinced it was the best game ever made, for a while, and it still might be. But Civ 6 has had me questioning if I even liked it since day 1. One gripe I have with it, that I didn't mention previously, that still remains is the choice of leaders. Theodore Rosovelt for US, really, not washington?! or even Lincoln? And on the same note I noticed the anti-semites at fiaxis havent included Iraeli/Jewish though the oldest CIV still in existence. Jews last appeared in Civ 2 (call to power). And I understand the obligation to include American Civ but mexican is an older civ than american but has yet to appear in any game ( and don't tell me its represented in the Aztec Civ ), because that would be like leaving out the American Civ in Civ 5 and saying it is represented by the Iriquios. Mexico has the most populous city in the Americas. But the lack of Mexico is not the reason this game failed for me, it's just one of the things it didn't do that would have made sense. But not a lot in this game makes sense, like the fact that most people are playing with more powerful computers than they were years ago when 5 came out, yet their latest installment seems to be lacking in features, details and graphics. It honestly feels like a game that should have been released for a mobile device and I have this feeling it was meant to be and probably will be eventually. If it was a $10 mobile game I would give it a thumbs up. $60 predecesor to Cive 5, nope."
81,63.7,Recommended," October 25, 2016",4,"Having played Civ since Civ IV with well over 100+ hours in V, I've already put in 51+ in VI. The game is fun, I enjoy the new set ups for the Culture vs Science trees, giving you a different way to focus on advancement. Does it have problems? Sure, the card system making some choices obsolete when you haven't advanced far enough on the other tree can be -really- annoying, but it isn't game breaking.The positives first, I guess.New Trees give a different way to advance, you can be far more focused on Culture and tourism, it isn't all tied to Science now.The new District system are really neat, especially once you get the hang of how they work and how best to plot your cities around the shared bonuses they sometimes give later on. I like having tile choices for placing Wonders and everything, you have to make choices what you feel is more important in each city. Previously, I would pretty much just build almost every possible building for each of my cities, stacking everything in them because it was generally the best way to build. Now, you can specialize specific cities with which ever districts you want to focus on.Combat is similar to Civ V, not many changes there, though some balancing has occured here and there.Personally, I've found the new map style to be nice, it can be cluttered at times, but overall I approve.Now for some negatives and drawbacks...Diplomacy AI is wonky. Warmonger penalties are currently STUPIDLY high and war is enevitible if you don't play smart. Though, it is easier to deal with if you use the diplomacy window and read the 'relationship' status. Each listed positive and negative are added/subtracted each turn, so try and maximize how those play out, otherwise you'll find yourself bottoming out real quick.UI needs some work, it's hard if not impossible to find some of the things you used to be able to easily open and look at in previous games.Load times from saved games can be extremely long, and I've had some crashing/lock-up bugs, but nothing serious and I was always able to get my game back, minus a turn or two thanks to autosaves.Some have complained about the Religion aspect, the warfare system and what not, and I agree, the AI -loves- them WAAAY too much. My first game I had to keep Missionaries sitting outside of some of my cities just to keep the AI away from them. But, in my current game, it isn't even a factor yet and I'm hitting the Modern era already, no issues with it so it may just be specific leaders.Barbarians can be a major hassle early and then again in the Medieval era, just make sure not to leave yourself undefended and clear some of their camps quick. This is more of some advice than a complaint.It's different. I like the changes from previous games, some people don't but, basically, it's Civ, it has some changes and tweaks that make it 'new' and changes how everyone is used to playing, but overall I'm really enjoying it. I am glad I pre-ordered, just be ready for the more questionable/annoying parts I just mentioned, but if you live Civ, you'll enjoy this one too.... unless you just hate change."

48,31.0,Recommended, January 5,4,"I went into Civ6 not entirely sure what to expect. I've played Civ5 and enjoyed it immensely, and most of the reviews about Civ6 I had read said that it didn't hold up to its predecessor in any way, so when I bought it I did not have especially high hopes. I will also note that when I bought the game, it was half off, and I most likely would not have bought it otherwise (or at least until the price was reduced).Despite my low expectations, after playing multiple games and difficulties, I can definitively say that Civ6 is an incredible game and a worth successor in the line of Civ games. It's beautifully crafted and the gameplay is actually improved somewhat over Civ5, especially in terms of fighting and the overall victory and game mechanics. It's still a challenging game that makes you think ten steps ahead of your opponents, but the difficulty settings make it so that even novice players can have a fun, engaging experience.With regards to the characters one can play, all of the new additions are fun and challenging, and as a history nut I love the wealth of lore and backstory we receive about each leader. The gameplay is just as exciting as Civ5, and in Civ6 I find it a lot easier to figure out what you need to do and where in your victory progress you are with relation to the other characters.The only thing I will say that I genuinely dislike is the new interaction menu for city states and leaders; it's easier to navigate in Civ5 than in Civ6 and for players who are new to the game, it can be a little bit frustrating to try and make heads or tails of.I don't use a gaming laptop, but Civ6 runs well on my normal Lenovo. I've had a few issues with exiting from the main menu where the game will freeze up and I have to get creative to close it, and there are a few bugs here and there with the ingame map, but nothing too serious and nothing that's made the game difficult to play.Overall, Civ6 is a fun, immersive, and challenging addition to the family of Civ games, and I would recommend it both to veterans of the franchise and newcomers who want to try out a turn-based strategy game. However, because it is a pretty expensive purchase and there are a few bugs, I generally would advise people to wait for a sale or discount on the game."

423,64.3,Recommended," December 16, 2016",4,"When I first read about Civilization VI my ""Buyers Beware"" senses immediately started tingling.2K and Firaxis had made some fairly... strange development decisions previous.- Sidmeier's Starships- Civ: Beyond EarthIt felt like the franchise was becoming the same as ANNO, where every game since 1404 is literally a copy&pastewith a different tileset and some very minor adjustments.Switch to late 2016, Civ VI releases and I buy it on day one.I had informed myself from previously available reviews and Twitch streamsand realised that it was not Civ V redux minus the addons.So what is Civ VI then?It's a Civilization game alright, but the focus this time is more towards the boardgame nature ofturn based strategy games.More cartoony graphics, rules that are less realistic but instead bring more depth on the table,and a generally fairly different approach to the franchise's advanced game mechanics.Of course you're still building cities, constructing buildings, recruiting armies and researchingnuclear weaponry (Ghandi, I'm watching you...).However the way you do all of this has become slightly different.Take research for example, now you can (And theoretically have to) fullfill certainrequirements to reduce a technologies research time by half.""Kill 2 barbarians with slingers"" -50% research time for archers""Destroy a barbarian camp"" -50% research time for ironThis holds true for both the regular research and the new politics system.The system from Civ V was completely remade and now is generally very similiar tothe way research works.Instead of research points you need culture and the politics you ""research"" usually don'tgive you something directly but instead grant you access to political cards and governmentswhich you can change around in the government tab.Additionally this research tree also has all the diplomatic options in it andusually there's also a building or two to be gained from this research.Other changes are the combat system, which is in it's core the same as before withminor additions like being able to order a civilian and military unit to move together.The combat itself also seems faster paced, especially once the barbarians start climbing the tech tree.Trade is working nicely (Although it required a patch first) and the AI finally stoppednagging me about everything via diplomacy.One of the downsides though is the lack of diplomatic depth that's largely missing due tothere not being a united nations congress this time.I assume it's going to be future dlc/addon material, however the lack of one really comes acrossas missing a major game mechanic.Diplomacy in itself is interesting in the many methods you can deploy to annoy or befriend the AI.Recent patches have also improved the AI logic in this regard though it still sometimes goes haywire.Now to end it with one final difference to Civ V.Instead of constructing buildings inside your city you're now forced to build districts which then harbouradditional buildings.Sometimes that means you're following a chain of constructable buildings, sometimes that means choosingbetween available buildings.In general I love this idea.It's awesome, military districts offer a second spawn point for units and with the first few buildings also grantsa military outpost that's capable of doing a second city attack on enemy units.Religious district can serve as healing stations for units with the right perks and oh crap I haven't even touched on the religion part of the game...Religion in Civ VI is much more in-depth than ever before, literally has it's own units to construct and fight with,but suffers from being very tedious at the endgame.I could write about all the cool and not so cool stuff for days me thinks.But I want to push this review out before christmas 2035, so....Is Civ VI worth your money?60€? No, that's expensive as cake.Find it for less than 60€ on other (legal!) online stores?Grab it, it's a great game, patches have made it even better and it's only at the start of it's life time.Sure, there's some minor stuff here and there and obvious addon bait waiting to happen, butit's still one of the best gmaes 2016 has to offer.If you like turn based strategy games then there's literally no way to avoid this one."

78,30.1,Recommended," March 20, 2017",4,After reading the reviews I decided to pick this up to see if the AI was really that bad. The answer is; no it’s not bad at all. Unlike previous Civ games they gave each civilization their own unique personality. If you don’t want them to dislike you and eventually go to war with you then you have to do things they like. My first game I had over half of the AI’s in an alliance. It’s really that simple. Here are some examples. Arabia doesn’t like it if you have more wonders then them. Scandinavia likes it if you have a big military and so on and so forth.

The gameplay has changed with the new game which is fine, but the ""removal"" of funktionality we had in Civ IV and Civ V are gone. Multiplayer is a joke, cant even get a game because it runs through ""download regions"" on steam.The AI is terrible, no matter what they always popup with the same boring messages, and get offended over things that should not even affect them. Makes no sense at all.Unfortunatly it feels like we are starting from scratch again, and it should stand on it's own, NOT BEAR THE NAME of one of the best gaming series through pc gaming history. I fear it end here. The developers was warned LONG before release, even when they started showing bits and pieces, but as true conartists they completely ignored the feedback on their own forums, and whent ahead completing the game to a SUP PAR standard.Only purchase on discount. This is similar to how EA screwed the simcity franchise with that awfull cartoon builder, fireaxis is now screwing the civilization in a similar way, cartoonish and simplification that ruins the beloved game play.Now we need a new ""company + developer"" to come in a swoop up all us ""used-to-be"" loyal civ players with an alternative title, in the same way it happened with Cities: Skylines."

45,63.7,Not Recommended, February 11,4,"Product received for freeI have only played this game for 8 hours, as such it should be considered an ""intial impression"" review.I would have played this game longer, but apparently Sunday isn't an actual part of the weekend.The thing is, it's not a bad game, it's a fairly good game, I'll even give it a7/10 (seven out of ten) Rating.So why no recomendation?Because its predecessors are too damn good; and for $60 it doesn't do much to improve upon the series, even half off at $30 you're not paying for much more than what Civ 5 already has to offer.This game feels like an additional expansion to Civ 5 Complete Edition; except that for each step this game goes forward it takes a step back.-The district system is pretty cool, they took an interesting mechnic from Endless Legend and made it better.-Culture doesn't seem to grow borders as much, you're gonna spend more cash on borders here; ironically Washington from Civ5 would do better in Civ6 than the game he competed in.-Overall I liked the diplomacy mechanics, the options in interacting with other Civs and city-states are better; unfortunately while the diplomacy mechanics are better... the Civilization AI is weird, irrational, and insane.-New tech progession mechanics are pretty cool, but can also be very frustrating.-The government/civic system is different, not better or worse, just different; didn't have enough time to get a good look.-Notifications and UI took a step forward then back, you can lock military units to civilian units, but the game does not display a notification when hostiles are close. When I lost civilian units in Civ5 it was becuase I was being an idiot and sending them into hostile territory without an escort, when I lose civilian units in Civ6 it's because of my failure to micromanage babysit even while they are in cultural borders.-The biggest frustration with this game is the barbarian mechanics. There is no raging barbarian option in the map setup anymore, barbarians are either on or off; and when they're on from the very begining of the game it's raging barbarians (no joke, my first game I had 7 barbarian units swarming my capital on turn 20). The thing is, once you kill a few barbarian camps it's like they never come back. Previous Civ games had light barbarians in the ancient era, with them becoming more frequent in the mid classical era, and as the Civs would take over the map eventually barbarians would become irrelevant. Here it's barbarian insanity on turn one with them disappearing in the classical era. It also doesn't help that cities can no longer make ranged attacks.Ending the review, I would say that if you're a huge fan of the series and money is no object buy the game; but...If you have never played a Civilization game either start with Civ5 Complete Edition (DO NOT buy Civ5 without the expansions) or Civ2 (if you can find it).If you already have every previous Civilization but are looking for something different and more combat orientated take a look at Endless Legend.If you already have every previous Civilization game and don't like the adversarial nature of Endless Legend...Play Civ5 Complete Edition some more, it is the greatest 4x ever made."

For instance, the AI civs now spam you with proposals which right from the outset they aren't willing to accept. Even worse, the AI now drastically overvalues resources, and is now willing to trade multiple cities for just a single resource. In the course of only a few turns, I managed to gain more than 50 cities from three different AI civilizations, and all it cost me was a few resources and a small amount of gold. These are the worst bugs I've personally experienced, and judging from other reviews there are plenty more besides.I just can't fathom how Firaxis ever thought it was a good idea to bring the Summer patch out in its current state and ruin an otherwise good game.

Civ VI feels and looks just like the mobile phone app, and despite this, I really need Civ VI to develop a viable Strategy View and get rid of the cartoony feel.

64,59.0,Not Recommended," October 29, 2016",4,"It's not that I don't recommend the game... I just don't recommend the game right now. Civilization V is way more worth your buck.This Civ has an awful problem with AIs. As an experienced Civ player, I believe the AIs in this one are the worst. They get angry over the smallet things and, I kid you not, will go to war with you within 20 turns and wreck you. The smallest things upset them and you can never get them on your side for long. The only ""alliance"" I've ever made with a character was Teddy Roosevelt, but when someone declared war on me, he considered me a warmonger and declared war on me no more than 2 turns later. Thats just a couple of examples of diplomatic AIs.On the research side, the AIs never advance in technology it seems. I've been playing games on Immortal, and I've noticed that I can get to robotics by the 1700s, but the AI is still using catapults and crossbowmen. During the 1900s I had helicopters and tanks, but the AI still had catapults and crossbowmen. They occasionally had musketmen. For some reason the AI doesn't function well at all which is literally 90% of the fun in a Sid Meier game.The graphcs are ""meh"". When I watched trailers of the game, I was pretty excited. When I got the game, it felt very underwhelming and cluttered. Its like you have to train your eyes to enjoy the environment because theres so much crap everywhere! The leader scene quality is awful as I don't like the ""PIxar"" style animation they chose for this one. I turn off leader scene quality and replace it with the 2D cutouts, its better that way. On top of that, the leader scenes don't have anything pizazzy about them like Civ V does (example: Civ V George Washington is in his office standing near lots of books and a globe or Queen Elizabeth sitting on her throne). The Civ V graphics look insanely more reliastic, which makes me enjoy it because I'm a history buff and I like to use my imagination. The childish graphics in Civ VI arent bad, but they just dont feel fitting when Civ V was realistic. I was hoping Vi would be even more realistic.Like I said, Civ V is worth more for your buck. Get that instead if you're new to Civ. You'll enjoy it way more."

78,30.1,Recommended," March 20, 2017",4,After reading the reviews I decided to pick this up to see if the AI was really that bad. The answer is; no it’s not bad at all. Unlike previous Civ games they gave each civilization their own unique personality. If you don’t want them to dislike you and eventually go to war with you then you have to do things they like. My first game I had over half of the AI’s in an alliance. It’s really that simple. Here are some examples. Arabia doesn’t like it if you have more wonders then them. Scandinavia likes it if you have a big military and so on and so forth.

45,63.7,Not Recommended, February 11,4,"Product received for freeI have only played this game for 8 hours, as such it should be considered an ""intial impression"" review.I would have played this game longer, but apparently Sunday isn't an actual part of the weekend.The thing is, it's not a bad game, it's a fairly good game, I'll even give it a7/10 (seven out of ten) Rating.So why no recomendation?Because its predecessors are too damn good; and for $60 it doesn't do much to improve upon the series, even half off at $30 you're not paying for much more than what Civ 5 already has to offer.This game feels like an additional expansion to Civ 5 Complete Edition; except that for each step this game goes forward it takes a step back.I will mention that Civ6 vanilla (no DLC) is better than Civ5 vanilla.While I didn't get much time to play this game, here are a few features of note:-The district system is pretty cool, they took an interesting mechnic from Endless Legend and made it better.-Culture doesn't seem to grow borders as much, you're gonna spend more cash on borders here; ironically Washington from Civ5 would do better in Civ6 than the game he competed in.-Overall I liked the diplomacy mechanics, the options in interacting with other Civs and city-states are better; unfortunately while the diplomacy mechanics are better... the Civilization AI is weird, irrational, and insane.-New tech progession mechanics are pretty cool, but can also be very frustrating.-The government/civic system is different, not better or worse, just different; didn't have enough time to get a good look.-Notifications and UI took a step forward then back, you can lock military units to civilian units, but the game does not display a notification when hostiles are close. When I lost civilian units in Civ5 it was becuase I was being an idiot and sending them into hostile territory without an escort, when I lose civilian units in Civ6 it's because of my failure to micromanage babysit even while they are in cultural borders.-The biggest frustration with this game is the barbarian mechanics. There is no raging barbarian option in the map setup anymore, barbarians are either on or off; and when they're on from the very begining of the game it's raging barbarians (no joke, my first game I had 7 barbarian units swarming my capital on turn 20). The thing is, once you kill a few barbarian camps it's like they never come back. Previous Civ games had light barbarians in the ancient era, with them becoming more frequent in the mid classical era, and as the Civs would take over the map eventually barbarians would become irrelevant. Here it's barbarian insanity on turn one with them disappearing in the classical era. It also doesn't help that cities can no longer make ranged attacks.Ending the review, I would say that if you're a huge fan of the series and money is no object buy the game; but...If you have never played a Civilization game either start with Civ5 Complete Edition (DO NOT buy Civ5 without the expansions) or Civ2 (if you can find it).If you already have every previous Civilization but are looking for something different and more combat orientated take a look at Endless Legend.If you already have every previous Civilization game and don't like the adversarial nature of Endless Legend...Play Civ5 Complete Edition some more, it is the greatest 4x ever made."

49,87.7,Not Recommended, April 7,4,I used to be a dedicated civ player for years. Civ VI - so SAD!!! Lost everything the game had. How can the AI be so bad - WTF???
121,118.1,Not Recommended," January 7, 2017",4,"A piece of failure.For those who like big maps: huge map is so tiny, you basically run into other players every 10-15 tiles.The AI is stupid, gets dumber every version of CIV they release. They just run their worker and settlers one after another into your army and often do not fight at all while you shoot them. In my last game, an AI player has run about 8 great adminrals undprotected right into my ships over a period of about 10 turns. I don't know what the AI wanted, but it moved them all in exact one direction right into my ships. If you think this is an exception and some rare bug: nope, it is NORAML in this game.It is okay, when something is not going well, as long as the game provides you a feedback, why something happend. This game terribly fails at this point. For example the information about the AI's mood is worthless, because your best buddies which have not a single negative point against you, join declare war on you - being on another continent. Why do you provide MOOD information, if it is either incomplete or pointless? The game is full of WTF moments.There is a new barbarian system - barbarian encampments spawn scouts. When they spot your city, they try to return to their encampment to notify and then a lot of units spawn to attack your city. In the early game this includes horseman and horseman archer, even if it is turn 5 and you have only a club warrior and maybe a slinger. So it is important to intercept those scouts. This extremely limits at how you can start a game, because it is all about pumping units to protect your borders, or else you are screwed. Even when you have covered a huge area around your cities and you have killed any scout, or there were no, sometimes you get overwhelming barbarian waves out of nowhere. The game fails to give any feedback about why that happened. A sign that something weird is going on is the symbol, when a scout spots a city: it is an exclamation mark above their head. This also randomly appears on OWN units indicating that my own unit is an barbarian and has just spoted my city... I had 3 games in a row, where a scout spotted my city at round 3 and 4. With a club warrior you get at the beginning, you are up to luck whether you can intercept the scout or not. A scout has 3 and a club warrior 2 movement mounts. A warrior requires 2-4 hits to kill a scout, depending on the tile the scout is standing. So it is plain impossible to stop him from spawning barbarian waves. They kept comming with 2 horseman and 1 horseman archer AND a scout, which again spotted the city... If you love being screwed randomly with no strategy to prevent it, you will love this game.There is a system, which allows you to boost EVERY research by 50% (half research is instantly completed) when you fulfill certain conditions. For example kill a barbarian with a slinger to get archery boost. Combined with those limitations caused by the barbarians early this additionally limits the way you play the game. Why? It is softly limiting you, because you have always the same starting routine, or else you just miss out free science and get behind in research versus AI. Potentially half the research you do, you can get for free. For every tech! Whenever I started a new game, I felt forced to either WASTE science points to play different, or play the same way.Diplomacy is barelly possible. It just consists of sometimes having luck to sell something very cheap to get at least something. Enemies you have defeated and which are weaker then you don't stop denouncing you, ignoring any threats not to convert your cities religion, spy on on you or commit sabotage. In most cases you are hated and denounced.The system how you can declare someone war without having the whole world against you is amazingly BAD. Over time you get different types of casus beli, like holy war, etc. which reduce the warmonger penalty. There are problems in this system:- Certain casus beli like reconquest of own cities are unlocked later. They should be available right ahead and cause no warmonger penalty for reconquering own cities.- Some ""aggressive"" actions, seem not to give any casus beli - like sabotage of buildings and being detected.- Casus beli do not add together. So if someone is decouncing you, converting your cities, spying on you, commit sabotage, You do not get a slighter warmonger penalty for all that together. You have to pick one casus beli and you have first to unlock it, most of them late in the game.- Very fast, almost any casus beli still cause severe warmonger penalty.Another of those WTF moments is, when a civilization with few cities which was underdeveloped 40 turns ago, suddenly is two eras ahead of best player. Or about 90 turns of research (when going the shortest way). AI skyrocketed for example to modern age suddenly when I did not even had gun powder - from being like half an era behind me.You can't have your units at borders inside your territory or the AI get rabies. They just walk as they desire and you can't tell them anything or declare war when they do so. If you have have close borders, you can't even place two units 1 tile off the actually border inside YOUR territory without the AI freaking out.When you want to fight against a common foe and you have your units in your friends territory and protect their cities, they freak out and tell you everything about your mother.The AI in this game urgently needs a straitjacket.Then there are bugs in which dialogs won't exit or the game does not shut down, combined with amazing smart feature that cause the window of this game to stay focused on top so you can not shut down it using task manager in an easy way.Civs like england have advantage when conquering or building cities on another continent (land is divided in different continents). The problem is, that I found no option for a generated map to have undiscovered and unpopulated continent and since war instantlly kills any diplomacy for the whole game conquering is not an option too. The game oftens give you some features you can not really play out due to other game mechanics. It its very poorly conceived. This is actually one of the most frustrating things, that gets worser with every civ version - beside the AI. You have not much time to play out something in an era, because it is over to fast and you are busy ""surviving"" the barbarians or trying to not loose science opurtunities. If you pick a slower game paste, you just need longer to produce everything. The time for everything is just stretched like rubber, without adding more to it. Most of possibilities which are theoretical available are hard to experience in reality due to time, game mechanic and soft limitations.Many many more issues I can't recall, but when I do, I will add them."

644,834.7,Recommended," April 7, 2017",40,"The game has been improved a lot by the Australian Summer patch and the Spring patch, it's what the game should have been at release. The AI can defend itself a lot better, plus they are more likely to be fond of you rather than just being upset and denouncing you. Diplomacy is a good bit better than Civ V IMO. The agenda system is an improvement, if your not warring Gorgo or Alexander will dislike you so if you're playing peaceful, starting next to them is a challenge.The game is at the right difficulty now IMO. In my recent Emperor game I was going for a Culture victory but fell a bit behind on Science. When I had Field Cannons and Musketmen, Australia invaded me and took me out with their tanks and Artillery. Not only did they have the more advanced tanks, they are ""Army"" tanks, not just single tanks.I also tried to go for a Culture victory on Emperor with Kongo, a powerful Cultural Civ, but I was really struggling. Before I used to have good success at Immortal difficulty, but I got took out fairly early on in my 3 Immortal games so far. I feel like i'll have to get a lot better before stepping up.Civ VI base game is a lot more complete than Civ V with all it's expansions. You can found an Empire rather than just going Tradition, founding 4 cities and rushing Rationalism, which was by far the superior way to go in Civ V. I also like that Spies can steal Money from other Civ's and that you can create rebellions in other Civ's cities. The ability to steal Great Works from other Civ's is nice.So overall, having put over 2000 hours into Civ IV and 849 hours into Civ VI, I say I am definitely content with how Civ VI is and like the direction it is going. IMO when it gets all it's expansions it will be superior to Civ V, and who knows, it could even challenge Civ IV."

Firaxis at the same time, is only producing content ""culture"" packs of new civs and scenarios without any announcement about an expansion that would add new features, techs, or alter elements of balance and pacing.This has set a lot of the community against them, and frankly, they're right to do so. The individual/paired civ DLC packs are BS because they don't address the thing we all actually want: new and/or improved *mechanics* and tuning on AI and Diplomacy.That said however, I went back to Civ 5 for a minute in order to refresh my memory and . . . frankly Civ 6 at its base is fundamentally better than Civ 5 with all of its DLC with the exception of content (# of civs mostly). All the features from the fully expanded 5 are present in 6 either fully or in a way that's either improved upon or just altered in a manner that's different enough to make a direct comparison invalid.So for the question of ""is this vanilla product better than the prior installment's vanilla product?"" Yes. It is. It gets a thumbs up for that reason.However, this game REALLY needs new mechanical content and re-balancing/tuning. Especially when it comes to pacing the tech/civic development.Splitting technology into a tech tree and a new ""Civics"" tree means you burn through both more quickly (especially the civics, of which there are far fewer) and end up over developed in both well ahead of the timeframe you would expect *even when you don't focus on it*. I have consistently maxed both trees out at around the 50-60% range of turns passed in a game on normal and epic game speeds. In the late game you can develop replacement techs faster than you can build the unit a tech unlocks. It's ridiculous (you need a mod to correct this now, but you shouldn't have to).What the game needs (desperately) is an expansion like Civ 4's Beyond the Sword, which brings in some more late-game tech, potentially brings back corporations and natural disasters, rebalances the development path, and improves AI so it's less reliant on starting buffs to be competitive. Ideally, they'd improve upon that idea and integrate more modern issues too, like terrorism from non-state actors, corruption of government, and potentially civil disturbances due to cultural/ideological clash within your own civ. These elements might clash with the comic book/cartoony/PC theme the game has embraced though, which is a shame.But sticking with the release of only small content DLC packs makes me (and I think others) worried that no such expansion is on the way any time soon. You'd expect at least an announcement by now, anyway.The ball is in Firaxis' court to address the problems with their game, but all is quiet on that front thus far. Hopefully, this will change soon.(EDIT: Aaaand a week later now, they announce Rise and Fall. Here's hoping it's good!)"

Some people are talking about it having 'mobile' game graphics, which is pretty unfair, but I can see the point. I just think the art style and interface design kind of works against you as you try to play. The esthetic is almost an obstacle to the actual playing of the game.All the familiar stuff we like about Civ games are here. It's a pretty faithful iteration of the things we enjoy about the franchise, but for reasons I can't quite explain, it left me wanting to play earlier versions; and then it left me wanting to play Stardew Valley's new patch. I'm not trying to be a♥♥♥♥♥♥about it - but on the face, I'm not sure there's enough innovation here. Full disclosure, I have like 500 hours logged in Civ 5, so I'm not just trolling...I'm going to keep hacking at it to see if there's some hidden charm that justifies the hefty price I paid for this, but for now I honestly can't recommend it.*EDIT*Well 15 hours in and I think I'll stick with my original assessment.

1,644.5,Recommended," November 2, 2016",60,"Civilizations will rise & fall, but this 4X strategy game is sure to stand the test of time.Firaxis devs have gone to great length to make this installment of the franchise not just different, but better. Civilization VI takes the fun to a whole new level of intensity with the improved AI, the enhanced art, & the combat systems.I only came to Civ V lately, as in this year. I’ve barely played a bit of the predecessors, just to get an idea of what I missed before the paragon that Civ V is graced my monitor. There are balancing issues yet with Civ VI. And the achievements need more challenge. But, for those who may be waiting for some of the reviews, I will just give you my list of 16 reasons I think the game succeeds as an heir to the Civilization throne.16. Multiple full color map filters: It’s much more than just the lovely map art, & the view of a map before the world is uncovered. They improve decision making just like all the other menus in the game. Pins are added to mark the map for exploration.You can retire a GP, convert him to a collectible or unit upgrade, keep him around for passive boosts, or even pass on him altogether; saving your points for the next GP in the lineup. If you want a GP & are losing to another civ, you can throw some hard earned gold into the GP pool to steal him before they are able to recruit him.I loved having John the Baptist found my first religion. But, also you can view a gallery of all your collected art & relics anytime, which are also obtained as relics from religious martyrs, & found in villages.Where movement is slowed down from geographical features on the map, you quickly feel more boxed in at first. But, this feels more natural because you begin to live in your own civ, not really moving out to see the world until mid-game or later. This forces you to be more aware of your neighbors than it did when you branched out all over the map.This is actually going back to Civ IV &, it definitely is a no-brainer. No reason why we shouldn’t be able to bind a soldier to our settler & send him around the world. Being able to build armies & regiments takes the warfare to a new level, in terms of power on the front line in a small hex of space.Lends a greater personal investment in “The Great White Arrows,” when you know you are sending them to their death with 3 promotion levels down the drain. There is a randomization feature that is great for getting these crazy names, if you don’t want to name them Jack or Fred.Yet, options are still present for making individual road segments with the engineers. Military engineers & builders are like specialists, compared to the workers from Civ V who did it all. The trade routes system is simpler to use, but you can NOT tell where you last sent specific routes. Of course this doesn’t seem to be a problem, since it’s easier to see at a glance & by popping out the right side tab where you already have routes currently.You can boost your bank account by investing in the Commercial Hub, or beef up production, Military, or Science at any time you need an edge in a certain direction. This gives the player more control over the outcome, & certainly allows for serious strategy.Wonders are bigger. Also, you can see the great works & trade them. Camera orientation during combat needs correction. It is necessary to edit game files to gain certain optional controls that should have been in- game, like spinning the map & stopping the infernal unit auto-advance. It does have the appearance that they weren’t quite finished with this aspect of the game at release. The art & graphic changes add greatly to the experience. For example, you can hover over districts in other civs to spy out what great works are hidden in which buildings, if you are planning to steal some art.Conquering a CS removes those resources & the protection buffer they provide from the other civs. You also have the ability to conscript their military. So, it’s more to your benefit to keep the CS intact.You have a choice about whether or not to invest in training spies. You can choose what action they take; steal art, siphon money, sabotage production by burning buildings, etc. Or, you may use them as counterspies, protecting specific buildings & their adjacencies. Roleplay is enhanced by choices for escape when detected. If you capture an enemy spy, you may trade him back to the opponent, or not.Not only are the wonders showcased on individual tiles, but they’ve made the details more visible, like mine cars zipping around the track. The art & music become a part of the world around you, with increased abilities to place & move works physically.Before, you had little options for dealing with those missionaries wondering into your civ, tearing apart the fabric of your culture. You couldn’t attack them or remove them with a unit without a war dec. The inquisition is more realistic, & dying apostles leave behind relics, which can be placed in temples, or traded as valued great works or stolen. I did find it unfortunate that I can’t rename my religion to a certain denominational name if I choose the Christianity symbol. You are able to choose a generic zodiac symbol & give it a name of choice, but that really is illogical. You should ideally be given more choices in personalization, not less than in Civ V.Alliances are totally expanded, allowing you to form relationships on different levels. It’s possible to convince the AI to change its plan to attack. The AI is more responsive to diplomacy, behaves more rationally & gives you feedback on how you are meeting their agenda. You are given more options for holding the AI accountable, as in being able to denounce them, or make them pay for spying on you. Sometimes the option appears to ask them to remove their units from your borders. But, this is not yet consistent.Over time, they fade from the game as you begin to encounter other civs. I don’t encounter pirates in international waters. A slider to increase the appearance of barbs would be great. Either way, the combat is definitely one of the best improvements in the game. More siege equipment is available. The improved landscape features allow for greater defensive power. Fighting is more visible & realistic looking.Some are pulled from the Tech tree, the ideologies, & policies of Civ V. Taken together with the Tech tree, it adds a masterful touch to the gameplay & just makes more sense. With the system of card slotting & governments whichever you choose, you can reach the victory of your choice. This expansion gives more control over boosts, & allows you the chance to steamroll your game, if you are wise enough to “lead your people well.” Comments & questions are welcome."
116,296.2,Recommended," October 13, 2017",158,"I decided to write this review after all the negative reviews and comments I read.I really do not understand why. Most of them seems to originated from old Civ5 players that compare Civ6 Vanilla with a Civ5 that has been retrofitted 2 times with 2 massive expansion packs. Well this is not fair, if you want to compare Civ 6 with something you will compare it with the plain Civ5 - thus with a game without religion, great works of art and a silly unit upgrade system with which you end up with lots of melee units that had 2 or 3 (useless for them) ranged unit promotions .But even if you decide to compare it with the complete civ5 the game have all the elements and less flaws of a fully developed Cv5. It has religion, great works of art and also have interesting new concepts that vastly improve the game. Concepts such as districts (districts with their adjutancy bonuses bring a whole new way of city planning), consumable workers (no more Idle worker at the end of the game), an improved Great people system taken from the founding fathers of colonization, (I still remember myself laughing with Picasso appearance in ancient era in Civ5), the ability to create armies and armadas (a lost civ4 concept) and more. To be honest the only new concept that I do not like is the way roads created in the game.So even if you decide to compare the Civ6 vanilla with the Civ5 including both its expansion packs, thus compare a game that has 1 year of development with a game that has 6, the verdict still goes to CIV 6.Sure there are bugs (all games have them) sure the AI is silly (It was more silly in Civ5 when it first released) but all those can be corrected in the future .So If you see things with a clear mind Civilization 6 starts from a better position and with a greater potential from all its predecessors. It is more complete and It has lots of new elements that bring a fresh approach to the series. Some people just wanted a Civ5 with new graphics. Well thank god Firaxis did not listen to them."

312,68.5,Recommended," October 25, 2016",52,"Product received for freeCiv 6 is a great installment for the long running 4x series, but even with the steps it takes forward to evolve its gameplay, it also takes a few steps back. This review is after ~50 hours of game time.Full Video:lets get the bad sorted... And this is mostly contained to two areas, that do impact the game quite a bit, these are AI and the Interface.The Ai is bad. It makes illogical choices, it uses it's resources badly and even on higher difficulties and with the cheating the Ai does, it still doesn't make sense. On top of the cheating Ai, it also tries to keep up with tech by just skipping entire trees of research. Which is very frustrating when they are somehow landing on the moon, without having done any of the research. which also makes your spies quite a bit less useful.Secondly - the UI is pretty sub-par. Information is often hidden behind several screens and tabs and even explanations on certain features (how do cities without amenities rebel game? HOW?). in their quest to show us the damn pretty graphics and animations, they have stripped important information away, and in a game where every bit of information matters, that is not cool.I hope mods will fix this problem asap even if the developers don't, as most of this information is available in the game in some form. Thankfully we do have mod-support from day one and that's a good thing.As i said, there are 2 main drawbacks, and those are it - if you can deal with those this game is damn good. The removal of global happiness for a multi- faceted system is great and gives more ""local"" controls, the addition of district is also a nice change and provides more choices to the player and information they have to weight in.I even like the switch with the wonders taking up a physical tile and the builders having limited actions.The one aspect i'm still divided on is the tech tree, as while i love the new civics system and government options, i don't like that the tech tree feels quite dressed down due to the splitting into two segments.Overal, i like the game quite a bit and find that the major issues are very annoying and frustrating - but for me at least, not game breaking."

Bottom line it improves upon Civ V in every way possible which is EXACTLY what I want to see in a sequel, the soundtrack might be the best in any game I've played, barbarians are more threatening than they are annoying now, Christopher Tin somehow topped Baba Yetu, the new graphics actually are surprisingly refreshing and fit the game very well, and the AI is much better! Teddy Roosevelt sending me apple pies instead of nuking me is a really nice change of pace. Overall, Sid Meier, I love you. This game deserves all the support it can get! EDIT: I would like to let everyone who's complaining about warmongering Civilizations in the ancient era that it makes complete sense. Since there is no warmongering penalty at the start your best bet for early expansion is to make use of battering rams and fight! That to me is pretty bad♥♥♥♥♥ The agendas DO work. Because I kept peace and didn't clear a lot of forests, Teddy Roosevelt became my ally. Frederick Barbarossa is unfriendly with me because I help a lot of city states. Keep in mind though that the game is a lot better with all the victory types enabled because otherwise everyone is going to be out to kill you.

51,20.7,Recommended," December 15, 2016",5,"IMO it's the best Civ has ever been. Fixes basically all of Civ V's problems (and there were a lot) and adds plenty of great new features.Positives:- Ideology is no longer half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and full of euphemisms. ""Order, Autocracy, and Freedom"" are rightly replaced with the unambiguous ""Communism, Fascism and Democracy"". Also the historical government options that are available from era to era are tasteful and fun to play with.- Policies (known as Civics in this game) are no longer set in stone and can be chopped and changed as needed, making it more hands on and less open to autopiloting (a la Civ V's ""if in doubt chose Tradition"").- Barbarians are peskier than ever (good imo).- Feels like it has all of Civ V's expansions right from the get go i.e. has religion, spying, ideology, etc.- War weariness and casus bellis add a good layer of depth to wars, and also prevents 1984-esque eternal wars (basically what always happens endgame Civ V in my experience).- AI isn't entirely incompetent (thus far, at least)- Quick load times, and crashes WAY less frequently (for me and the people I've played with at least). Like in a Civ V multiplayer game, i'd be expecting crashes every 1-2 hours. Now I can have comfortable crashless 2-4 hour games.- Lots of little neat features, e.g. builders having charges, promotions healing units, military unit corps (almost but not quite reminiscint of Civ IV's death stacks), the ability to link soliders with workers, map pins, etc- Global happiness is gone, and has been replaced with the much more involved local housing/amenities system. Which is great, I don't have to factor in my entire empire being immediately unhappy due to taking a few cities or settling a far off colony.- District system makes building cities a lot more in-depth (gotta get dem good adjacency bonuses) and less easy to autopilot.- ""Eureka moment"" system gives the player a rewarding amount of agency for tech and civic progress.- Gorgeous soundtrack.- Wonderful graphics for the terrain, buildings and units. Yes it's very simplistic, but personally I find it charming. Also the ""map"" theme they have going is great to look at. Wonders are also a treat for the eye.- Delicious UI; has a tasteful, almost steampunk design that fits every era.- Sean Bean.Negatives:- The art style the world leaders are rendered in (i.e. a kind of horrible histories-like cartoony style) is passable at best, horrible uncanny valley at worst. Cleopatra is one of the worst offenders."

You can literally get perfect production start right next to stone resource ( for example), and Ai will still always finish stonehenge before you get it half way on last two diff's, and you will never even get close getting a prophet for religion.- Some may like the narration of ""comical"" statements of tec's but I find it dull and really annoying in long run, not to mention the ruler animations, temper tantrums and absolutely random reactions to things. Because of this the first thing I did was to minimise all ruler effects and nowdays I just hammer esc during diplomacy, that part of the game is unberable. Ai also has a habit of asking for trade of artifact or great work they want... every single turn, despite declining their offers.- Era duration settings are unbalanced, you can have everything in the game researched by 1820's and just have future tec /civic researched for oblivion afterwards, and to earlier Ai cheating, yes you can have every tec in game by 1820's and STILL be last in science compared to ai.- The scouting barbarians. Oh where do I get stated. Fun idea at start.. yeah just stop barbarian from returning so they don't attack your cities, easy peacy right ? .. exept they scout with fastest start unit in game.. meaning if you use same unit or aren't blessed with flanking military unit, they ALWAYS manage to return before you can kill them, and then comes flood of nuisances.-AI dislike and like factors are just annoying. Settle in different continent ( and same land mass can have mutliple continents ) and you♥♥♥♥♥♥someone up, manage to get luxyry at start someone doesn't have can♥♥♥♥♥♥ai off, don't expand like madman ? pisses someone off, don't have large armies ? pisses someone off, have large armies ? pisses someone off.- There is no really efficient way of protecting city states in the game outside letting them be destroyed then liberating them, this also gets annoying in long run if you focus on that part of game.- Most of spy actions don't matter and the system is oversimplifiedly complicated as odd as it sounds. You have to protect districts separately with spies from spies but you never get enough spies to protect against all spies or even spare spies to attack opponents spies that magically know where you spy them at.,-Religious combat is a hoax really, Ai cities pump so much religion power that flipping cities is waste of time, I liked the older civ systems better.-Era and age system sucks♥♥♥♥♥ as you can ignore it entirely as the bonuses are borderline useless.

I'd be rightfully P-Oed if they didn't. I'm not a huge fan of buying seperate DLC, so that's kind of annoying. I'd rather pay a little more for an expansion including DLC and some updated concepts. It's not a bad game, and i'm not some hardcore gamer going out of their way to expose the ins and outs of the system. So far, so good. I think, to get all of it's worth, you have to play hard to your civilizations advantages, which means doing things which might be uncomfortable in the beginning like starting war before Iron is discovered. It's to your benefit that the AI aren't particularly good at waging war. Maybe that's boring to you, but for me, it's enough to sink only a few weeks of my life into this game and take a break every now and again. It's not overly addicting, and I can come right back to it and feel a deep satisfaction. It's an old system, but one with character and fresh innovations. Just needs some tweaking. Let's see the Expansions roll out over the next year or so."

72,42.4,Recommended," October 21, 2016",5,"So for those of you who don't know, Sid Meier's Civilization VI is a turn-based strategy game in which you endeavor to manufacture a realm to stand the trial of time. Become the Ruler of the World by building up and driving a development from the Ancient Era to the Information Era. Take up arms, direct discretion, propel your way of life, and clash with history's most noteworthy Leaders as you endeavor to assemble the best progress the world has ever known.Civilization VI is the best Civilization game to date. There have been numerous changes made to Civ VI from previous titles. There have been all kinds of revisions and incorporation's that have been implemented into the game by the developer Firaxis. Despite all the changes made to the game it still feels remarkebly similar to previous Civilization titles, you still build up urban areas, extend you supremacy and grow your military might. You keep on researching logical and social updates with a specific end goal to plot a specially designed way through history, from the Ancient Era to the Information Era.The art style is to a great degree, strangely bright and cartoonish. It brings to mind the console and mobile Civilization: Revolution games, intended to be significantly more available and speedy to play than the fundamental line titles. The character models for the leaders are spectacular, with amazing liveliness as well. Another reason it's delightful: the world is displayed as a map, finished with borders. Tiles your units are on or can see are hued in, while those out of range receive a dreary pencil craftsmanship look, similar to somebody's Here Be Dragons delineations on a old map. To think to what extent we endured that exhausting old fog of war for when we could have had this.Great People and Great Works have at last been revamped, the necessities to make or utilize one are significantly more particular and hazy than before. There's detail and thoughtfulness behind it, however. For example, Great People are currently exhibited as limited list of recognizably named historical figures, from a pool that is shared by everybody, in the way of Wonders.The main genuine complaint I have about the game is that the main menu appears to originate from a totally different game. The majority of the ""buttons"" in-game are material and welcoming, though the level outlines on the main menu scarcely look or ""feel"" like buttons by any stretch of the imagination. Its not a major ordeal clearly, it's only a shame that the very first thing you see takes a portion of the pop from the game itself."

I'd recommend playing Civ 5 instead."
91,466.1,Not Recommended," October 24, 2016",5,"As many of the other negative reviews have pointed out and for the same reasons, I think this game suffers from fundamental defects that make it difficult to enjoy. The user interface and information menus are clumsy and unintuitive. I can't sort my cities’ yields by production, gold, culture etc. The traders have the same problem with being unable to sort routes in an ascending or descending order of a particular resource. This makes the consistent management of trade routes and cities frustrating. When every other turn I have to assign spies and traders tasks, in which many times I just want them to continue what they were doing, the game becomes monotonous, and again, frustrating.Others have pointed out the player cannot customize a civ or leader. It seems the options to alter gameplay mechanics in civ v, like showing enemy moves or animating battles are not present in this current iteration. The map is cluttered and ugly, with the option of only having huge resource icons or none at all. The Civilopedia is as unwieldy and cumbersome as many other menus and largely unhelpful.Gameplay also seems broken in several regards. Diplomacy and the actions taken by the AI are largely a mystery. There is little in the game to explain its mechanics. Others have pointed out that districts get more expensive per civic, and that many wonders are better suited to the city center than their own tile. Others have pointed out that districts can’t be razed, sold etc. I can’t imagine the justification for many of the choices designers made for this game.While there is much to enjoy, this is either an unfinished product, or a poorly designed one. The fixes that need to be made are apparent. I hope those that bought early expecting a quality finished product will not be forced to pay for the necessary patches in the form DLC and expansion. I am on the whole unhappy with this product and do not recommend it.**UPDATE: In the late game caputring cities by any means is impossible as the program crashes to desktop 100% of the time, no matter how the city is captured. This is a widely reported problem with no fixes currently. UNACCEPTABLE."

The game actively encourages constant warfare with no way to counter it. Just by playing the normal game 80% of the civs will immediately dislike you - for doing things as simple as exploring, or keeping a defensive military, or not build a naval unit (despite being landlocked). Only one valid path to the game is to keep a large military.DOW - other civs will DOW on you for seemingly no reason constantly.Swarms - swarms of barbarians, religious units and massive amounts of city state units make the game a mess. There's so many units on screen its difficult to see terrain.Permanent denouncements - once you take any city from any AI that AI will denounce you constantly for the rest of the game. Thousands of years later.Linearity - due to the Eureka system, all AI's being unfriendly from the outset, no diplomacy at all and so on, there's only one way to play it. Build a big military.

33,30.3,Not Recommended," March 4, 2017",5,"I have been a fan of the Civilization series since I played Civilization III awhile back and honestly I couldn't believe the immersion. The feeling of being there 4,000 years ago, growing with your Civilization and seeing the landscape, architecture and technology change right before your eyes was incredible; that is completely gone from Civilization with this newest iteration.It all started in Civilization V with small things, leader portraits not changing with the eras (I.E. Roosevelt in a suit, in 4000 B.C. or Montezuma basking in the glow of a firepit in the modern age), the fact that unit stacking was no longer a reality also hurt the strategy aspect as it created a cumbersome and difficult logistics issue when moving units around, and those things carried over into Civilization VI.However, in addition to issues with immersion in Civilization VI (such as brick and masonry buildings in cities in 200 A.D., Skyscrapers in 1360 A.D., and infantry in 1500 A.D.) The Artificial Intelligence of the other opponents is the beginning of a great idea that feels incomplete, rushed, and unpolished. Not to mention the acceleration of science in the game. I can't recommend this title, the immersion is gone and I feel Firaxis is starting to mimic Electronic Arts in that they only want the money.Edit: In short, this isn't a labor of love."

In my first game Brazil was on the verge of getting the science victory, I send 4 units to its capital city. Brazil follows with retreating all its units (more and higher tier than mine) and I completely destroy him because he sends one unit at a time.So, the game could still be fun. Except for the gamebreaking bugs. I am currently in my THIRD!!!! game which I can't complete after two or three hours because there is a fatal bug in the savegame. The first broken game wouldn't load anymore. The second game crashed to desktop after I ended the turn and my current game crashes when I initiate trade with Kongo or the other way around.

93,128.8,Recommended," March 9, 2017",5,"I have been playing Civilization since it's existance. My favorite all time is probably Test of Time. I loved that you could go on to explore the Alien Planet after finishing the Space Race. With that being said.Civ 6 brought about some pretty cool changes to it.1) Districts. This is a fantastic addition to civilization because it allows, and in a way, forces you to specalize your cities. Alot of your district placements will depend on the land around you. Some cities are great for religion, others are great for production or science. No two are usually the same.2) Goverment. Goverments now use a ""card system"" with each card giving you a specific benfit. Early game they play a big roll in helping you grow and manage your civilization. You can boost the production of different units in your cities, generate great person points, or increase envoy gain speed, and much more. As the game progress though, you will find yourself switching these ""cards"" less and less as you establish a goverment to your liking.3) AI Personalities. The problem with some of the past civilization games is that you did not know why a civ acted the way they did to you. Some civs got mad and declared war or another civ suddnely loved you and made peace with you. Civ 6 does a great job of giving the player more information on how specific civilizations react to things. When you meet a civilization in Civ 6 imediaetly open up the diplomacy screen for that civ and take a look at their Agendas. This gives you a good indication on what they like and dislike. Decide who you want to be friends with, then work towards fulfilling the Agenda. (Some prefer things such as strong miilitary, high culture/religion/science, ignoring/working with city states.)4) City State changes. The City States have been changed to give you bigger rewards for investing in them. Each one gives you a specific benefit depending on their type, and the amount of envoys you place in them. Another benefit to them is you are able to higher their armies by spending gold. (Which you come by easily in most cases).Cons:1) Warmonger Penalties are too high. I do like the warmonger penalties as in real life if one country started invading and attacking other countries, it would anger others and drive them into action. With that being said, I think the penalty tends to be way to high, as civilizations tend to denounce you for a good 80% of the game just for taking one city (even if you were not the one to declare the war) I believe they need to balance this by either lowering the penalties recieved, or by decaying it at a faster rate.2) AI Smarts. The AI don't tend to be very smart even on higher difficulties after you have come to understand tricks of the game. I think in all of my games I have ever played, I have ran into maybe one time when I actually lost a city. They usually attack one unit at a time and then declare peace after a few turns. The AI has seen some minor improvements but you have more of a challenge from early game barbarians then you do from actual civilizations.OVERALL RATING 7/10Overall I give the game a 7/10. I think it is a great game that is improved as time progresses. Things that are broken are easily fixed with various workshop items. The biggest drawback, as I mentioned before, is the AI since they have the intelligence of a 2 year old many times."

From barbarians to warmongering nations, there was no respite in my first game.

Too tired to write a long review now. Released: Oct. 21st - Playtime on Oct. 22nd = 20 Hours. Should speak for itself ;)"
57,121.9,Recommended," April 1, 2017",20,"I'm pretty astonished at the kind of stuff people leave in Steam reviews.The AI is no better or worse than Civ V. It's definitely not great, but it never has been. On the whole this iteration seems like Civ V vanilla plus some improvements, I'm honestly not sure what the complaints are about...The new city building mechanic is great, the districts are a nice addition as are the changes to happiness.It really seems like the only thing people can find to complain about is the AI or the graphics (if you watched literally any trailer on the game before you bought it, why would the graphics surprise you?)People with 100+ hours giving the game a ""do not recommend"" ? You serious?"
215,0.2,Not Recommended," December 7, 2017",6,"Bought this game a few months after the initial release during a sale, assuming that like its predecessor Civ 5, it would be a good game to play with my partner. It turned out that there was not cross compatibilty between Mac and PC LAN games, so we both immediately refunded the game.I was excited to check again today now that it's been well over a year since release date, and since there's still no cross-platform in sight, I'm dropping a negative review. This is ridiculous.For the record, I'm sure the game is wonderful, and I'm very excited to try out both multiplayer and single player whenever this issue is resolved, but in the meantime I can't give a positive review."

Units constonatly move when I don't want them to, constant popups, the constant dragging of the mouse to select the right unit because my camera moved to my scout on the other side of the map because he found something completly uninportant. Often the game doesn't tell you why you can't do certain things simply greying out the option without telling you why or how. the camera controls and locked in and aren't allowed to be changed. these problems were present in civ V but are only amplified. note: I DID play CIV: V but no peevious installments"

259,106.9,Recommended," October 25, 2016",6,"Absolutely brilliant continuation to the franchise! Executed very well unlike most triple A titles today. I would recommend it at this current time and, without a doubt, later on too. My hours say it all for this game. I've already found myself checking the time at the start and it being 4:00 pm and then checking a couple of hours later and then what do I know, my alarm's going off at 10:00 am. I cannot deny the fact that this game still continues its ""Just One More Turn"" idea.People are often comparing this game to Civilization V a lot which is bad. This game, from what I can tell, is the best bits from each Civilization compiled into one, as well as a few improvements that haven't been attempted before, to make the best Civilization game yet. I believe this has been done fantastically!One reason my friends didn't enjoy Civilization V that much is because they found that at one point, they would be doing nothing at all (to the point where their city has nothing to produce but units). They'd mention that there weren't many units to choose from and that it would get boring quickly. This time I would say that this is no longer a problem. I found myself struggling to decide between whether I should build up an army and build up my empire or attempt to continue at my current size and military in an attempt to take the lead with a certain victory like Science, Culture or Religion. If I chose to build up my empire, I'd struggle between whether I should build a settler or builder, or if I should build a slinger or warrior. If I chose to head for a victory early, I'd have to decide between districts or improvements on my City Centre. All of this to consider as well as many new features such as boosting your techs or civics, what government suits you best and what policies will match your goals. Throughout the entire game I felt like I was always busy and this continued my addiction to clicking the ""Next Turn"" button.The graphics feel a lot similar to Civilization Revolution, which I did like as well as Civilization V's graphics as well, and really makes it feel like you're playing some form of board game. Unlike in Civilization V where it felt like you were spinning a globe around, this gives it the feel that you're reading a map and pin pointing unit orders and other such things alike. Either way, this does not break the immersity. You will still feel like you're ruling a Civilization as always. The graphics did not change the way I play except from the fact that I found myself panning in and out a lot more to see from different perspectives. I love their new hotkeys to rotate the camera too (ALT + LMB)!The soundtrack sounds a lot like Civilization V's and I think they have even kept some sound from that and put it into this game. That doesn't matter much though, as they've clearly done a fantastic job on their theme song. I love how the soundtrack adapted upon you entering new eras just like in various other Civilization games throughout the franchise.Now the AI should be spoken about separately, paired with the diplomacy system. Some people are going over the top when talking about the diplomacy system dragging the game down. It's not as bad as it has been portrayed. Yes, the AI are aggressive but they can also be reasoned with. All of them. I think a lot of people miss the whole idea around Agendas. I agree with the fact that, yes they're annoying considering you can't be friendly with everyone but that's not how it works in reality. Ghandi (talking about the real Ghandi, not the one that nukes everyone) was all for the peace but he couldn't befriend everyone as it just so shows looking back on how he died. Therefore, I feel like the Agenda system is somewhat a good idea. What I see as an issue with the AI at this moment in time is they will attempt to attack you for no reason (Surprise Attack). Do they gain a warmonger penalty? Yes. Do they care? Not the slightest bit. One bug I noticed was when I was allied with Cleopatra (she was my only ally at the time) it came up with something along the lines of ""An allied friend has told us Cleopatra is launching a Surprise Attack on the Arabian capital."" I was Arabia by the way. I was so confused. She couldn't, and never did, attack me since she was my ally. But this still tells me that no matter what your relationship with a Leader is, when they get the chance they will try their best to declare war on you.All in all, I see no other issues with this game. I love almost every piece of it and can't wait to see what DLC has to offer. I expect to be failing all my exams, losing all my friends and being disowned by my own family in the upcoming month or so. But that'll be after the next turn anyway...I rate this game:9/10.I expect that this will reach Overwhelmingly Positive reviews at some point.EDIT: I nominated Civilization VI for the ""Just 5 more minutes"" Award since my turns take about 5 minutes to complete each anyway. If I could nominate it for a second, it'd be the ""Test of Time Award"" but sadly we can't do two.PS: To those on my friends list asking if it's worth the money, yes. I would certainly say it is.

285,16.6,Recommended," October 23, 2016",6,"Definitely much better than Civ V at launch in terms of completeness and you definitely don't feel as jipped.As every professional and user review has probably said, the new district mechanic is great in terms of decision making. Also looks great too as you see certain cities specialize in certain tasks. This combined with the movement nerf and harder barbarians really make this into a completely new game for the better. The presentation and polish is even better than Civ V from what it feels as well.Some city-states are likely to become full fledged civs judging from from what I've seen so that feels a bit weird.I can see where they need to expand in terms of depth to reach the complete Civ V experience and am looking forward to it. It feels currently like a less complete Civ V with all expansions but definitely feels like a coherent gameplay experience.Definitely the best Civilization Sid Meier's made and looking forward to the expansions and more civs!"

This game has no soul, it feels like a visually sumptuous city builder.Pros:-It looks pretty-soundtrack seems beautifulCons:-Sean Fkn Bean (seriously, if like me you are allergic to him, do NOT go near this game)-It all feels a bit clunky, if you hover over your various different currencies at the top, you will get a basic break down, but then theres no further information, clicking on it does nowt. The same thing for the new stats in your city panel, some have hover over tooltips, others simply do not.-Happiness has been replaced by utilities, but there seems again to be no way of tracking this, it doesnt even get a place on the currencies bar at the top.-No overviews (Military, Diplomatic, Trade etc. all gone)- there seems to be no way of seeing what all your potential trade routes are, it only recognises a potential trade route if you have a free trade unit in a city, and then only from that city.- no diplomacy overview, you have to go into the video diplomacy screen everytime you want to check something, and theres a lot of info i'm used to having thats just not there-NO CITY SCREEN, you now get a panel that kind of treats a city like a unit (and no way of apparently leaving the city panel without deliberatly clicking on a unit and then on the ground?)-No City build queue-'C' no longer centres on unit, and cannot bind a key to do this-Religion, they seem to have kept the bare bones (most of the beliefs from civ5 seem to be there, tithe, pagodas etc); but there seems to be no way of identifying religious pressure, are you doing well or not? is a city of yours likely to convert? dunno.-No alert setting for units, you can fortify a unit but it will not wake up if there is an enemy unit in sight-No score panel (not vital, but always gave me a sense of how i was doing)I might add more to this later, Steam have refused to refund me because i played over 2 hours, so i'm stuck with it.My advice would be do not waste 50 quid on this, wait for the first xpac when hopefully (a la Civ5) they will resolve many of these QoL issues. It has many flaws that will become clearer as more people put the hours in, i can only hope Firaxis will respond.Thank you for your time.Edit: Oh and by the way, as others have pointed out, the AI is a reckless drunk."

1,44.9,Recommended," October 24, 2016",112,"TLDR:I have 42 hours played in the 3 days after the release of the game. I have played every Civilization game and this is my favorite one. I recommend it if you are a fan of the series or looking to try the series out. It's especially good for new players since it has a tutorial based on your experience with the Civilization franchise.My Impression:Civilization is such a complex and in depth game and to feel so intuitive to play is impressive. After all that it stays a game to that remains fun, exciting, and unpredictable after hundreds of hours of play? That’s joyous.Positive:+ The music of this game, especially the start screen is beautiful and powerful+ Voice acting is on point and is throughout the game in every aspect+ AI is realistic in the personality of the leaders. Certain leaders will spread the religions they are known for. This wasn't the case in the previous ones. The leaders act how they would if they were still alive, so very realistic.+ Amazing strategy game that defines the 4x genre+ Steam Achievements+ Steam Trading cards- Initial Civilizations introduced with the release, I was hoping for more leaders and some specific ones that were not included- Some people find the graphics cartoony, I like the graphics.- I don't like the way they do the DLC of releasing new leaders- This review was written 3 days after release and the game can still use a few balance patches to get to perfectionP.S. Civilization 4 was my favorite until I tried Civilization 6. I can only imagine it gets better with mods and DLC."
455,20.2,Not Recommended," October 23, 2016",12,"TL;DR it's not a bad game, but Civ V is superior. DLC might fix it, but it's not worth playing until then.Why don't we have a ""Neutral"" recommendation button? We need it for Civ VI, because while this is an acceptable entry into the series, I can't ever see any reason to play it over Civ V.There are a bunch of great new features (Districts make you feel more like you're playing Endless Legend, though that game still does tile based city building better imo), but they're all held back by some really awful design choices, a few bugs, and horrible AI.Pros:The foundation is clearly here. With 2 or 3 big expansions (DLC's bleh), it could easily be a great game.The inspiration system, makes the science and new civic tech trees feel fresh and exciting without feeling overly powerful.Natural wonders feel far better than they did in Civ V (They now tend to give bonuses to tiles around them, making controlling them far more beneficial).Global happiness is no longer a horrible limiter in the mid game.City-States no longer require massive sinks of gold to get small perks, rather you complete quests and are granted envoys who give you bonuses.Cons:Art style is awful compared to Civ V, personal preference obviously, but Civ V was a beautiful game. This feels too cartoony and isn't whimsical enough to warrant it.AI is atrocious. We're talking absolutely worse than Civ V. They'll make wars with you they can't win for no reason, will build cities in horrible spots, build districts poorly, and even get destroyed by barbarians near the start of the game. As someone who played on immortal difficulty in Civ V and really wanted better AI this is quite possibly the most disappointing thing about the whole game.Movement and combat of units is tedious due to how the system of movement has been changed. You will not catch a scout unless they corner themselves. The actual combat hasn't changed, but the changes to movement and how impactful rough terrain can be makes it all so much slower and less engaging.The UI is bad. Menus don't pop up when you click the city, but rather you need to click other buttons while the city is selected to see actual details. There's no game log of any kind so if you miss the fast messages telling you what just happened you'll never see it again. The UI also seems to be hard to directly interact with. The amount of times I try to view a notification only to select the ground beneath said notification is too high.Lastly bugs. There are tons of them. Bugs with the steam overlay, with not being able to name cities, issues with loading saves, and even a strange issue where I kept getting notified stonehenge was built, 300 turns after it'd been built."
241,46.7,Recommended," June 27, 2017",29,"I love this game, even if others don't. Just to be able to lose myself in 16 hour games is a recommend from me, not many games can keep me from getting bored and switching it off for me anymore."
132,61.6,Not Recommended," October 23, 2016",23,"This game is pretty much civilization 5, but less fun.The largest problem with this game, and with a lot of the civ games, is they build these complex mechanics into their game, but there's little reason to invest in them.There's little reason, because the way to win the game on higher difficulties is to spam units and take advantage of the horrendous combat AI. Yes, the AI is bad. Yes, it's worse than in civ 5. Other civs will ignore your unprotected workers/settlers. They won't pillage. They won't attack a city unless they have it surrounded. Sometimes they'll ignore your units even if they have them surrounded. I've held off wars with just two slingers against entire armies. The barbarians are a far greater annoyance in this game than any civ.In summary, here's a list of things that are worse in civ 6 compared to civ 5:Minimap (impossible to read it)UI (complicated and uninformative)AI (they can't even use the new mechanics)Policies (You'll end up using the same 3-4 cards every game)Game speed (Production takes too long)Happiness/Amenities (You can't even tell which resources are providing you amenities)Resources (They are everywhere, but also pretty unexciting)"
931,67.6,Recommended," November 24, 2016",12,"A lot of people compare Civ VI to Civ V the complete edition, which by lengths is unfair. Civ VI is by far better than the base game of Civ V without the expansions. In due, time we’ll all watch this game flourish even more with the introduction of expansions. Civ VI has breath taking graphics in comparison to any other game of this category in my opinion. I’m comparing this to most 4X games such as Endless Legend, Sorcerer King and previous Civ games.I must also compliment the new combat focus, it’s by far one of the most engaging I’ve come across in a long time. The AI feels more balanced and gives a deeper depth to the game, multiplayer is a lot of fun with good friends for playful banter or a more serious approach. Barbarians are as annoying as ever xD and more aggressive than what I remember in my 175 hours of Civ V. As a fan for 4x games, I’m impressed by this game as a whole; there are a lot of positive points in Civ VI. Please don’t let others alter your thinking about a fantastic game."
109,161.4,Not Recommended, April 12,12,"This is the worst CIV EVER!Not only that somebody decided to use comic graphics that look like as if they were made for brain damaged eleven year olds no - the game will either defeat you within the first 50 rounds or kill you slowly with boredom!There are three ways to play:Difficulty ""Prince"" or lower - you´ll either colonize Mars in the mid of 15th century while you´re fighting off bowmen with your modern tanks and bombers or you´ll directly go for domination (as everyone calls you ""warmonger"" until the end of time for a war started 500 B.C.) and conquer the whole world by 1200 A.D. latest.Difficulty ""King"" or above - either in turn 30 your (so far) best friend and neighbour will come with like 50 units which he obvoiusly produced in his only city and ovverrun you or - if you manage to survive, due to lack of neighbours or super agressive playing - you´ll end up loosing the game by turn 452 because some other pkayer managed to settle to mars or win by culture.In the meanwhile you´ll be the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of the world anyway - because every neighbour (or even Civs from the other side of the globe) will tend to attack you every now and then just out of ""reason"". So after the third our fourth war you may loose your nerves by again and again and again defeating their armies and negotiate peace (which will be broken anyway later) and start to destroy their cities - WARMONGER!Anyway - you´ve spend trillions of resources on military instead of culture, sience or religion (which was your imitial idea of wining the ""peaceful"" way) then you´ll start to conquer the world, again... :/Sounds fun! BUT it isn´t! The KI is so brutally stupid (irrespectable the difficulty) that even completely tecced CIVs will use Bowmen and Horses (maybe Knights) against Tanks, Bombers and Artilery or just don´t defend itself properly. Obviously the only move KI knows is to rush for your Cities while if attacked there is almost no defense! In the late game once you killed all ground forces a paintaking slow and boring routine of bombing, conquering and bombing again will be ""the art of war"".The only thing where the KI is brilliant at is to know how you´re intenting to win even it is not ""aware"" of you at all - once you start to build a religious district at least two or three CIVs will found their religion prior to you, so you may have the ""leftovers"". If you go for domination all CIVs will be super agressive in the early game until you´re to hard to conquer or attack them yourself.There are a lot of good concepts in this game - however none of them seems to be thought till the end, frustrating!"
271,36.0,Recommended, April 8,12,"As a big fan of Civilization 5, I was recultant to buy part six for a long time because the negative reviews scared me off. Now I decided to give it a chance anyway (at a discount) and was pleasantly surprised. The game feels different enough to be a fresh experience. I don't get the hate because the new features actually feel well-thought-out.- Content:I'm glad to see this isn't Sims 4. The content from Civ 5 is there. They didn't, for example, remove religion to make it a DLC. Diplomacy is a little lacking, though, and there's no scenarios in the base game.- Changes I like:World wonders are now harder to build and need their own tiles (which makes sense). The city district system adds diversion because now you actually have to decide what buildings you need more. The days of spamming everything are gone. You can speed up research by doing certain tasks that have to do with the research topic. City states now require envoys instead of money. It takes much longer to befriend them now. Workers and research were also changed.- Graphics:Yes, the graphics are cartoony, and the landscape looks kinda ugly. But you get used to it... and the buildings, especially the world wonders, are detailled and nice. The video sequences look good, too.- KI:I can't say much about that because I actually never play on a higher difficulty than Prince. I get denunciated a LOT, though, for almost everything. And sometimes leaders refuse my friendship request just to propose it themselves in the very next round.- Negative thoughts:The music isn't diverse enough. Bigger maps are laggy. The advisor screen was removed. I was disappointed to see there's only one leader for each country again. And even when you start on a huge map, you'll often have another civilization right at your doorstep."

Civ IV still remains the high point of the series, sadly.At least city sites are back to being interesting again, instead of every city averaging out to be identical like in Civ V.In my first proper game trying it out, I exhausted the science tree and was several into 'future tech' by the time my first space factory was available (around 1940 in that game). So I have almost a hundred turns to go to just slowly build the various precursors and the spaceship parts... and I was already bored. And the turns still take too long in the end game.And the diplo screens... oh my god, why are they so slow? It's not like diplo is all that good, yet you waste so much time with the slow fade ins, 'colour' talk, slow fade outs and so on.Definitely don't pay full price for this one."
217,24.5,Recommended, January 11,1,"This game is quite good (even though Civilization 4 remains my favourite Civ).One of the few issues I have with this game is that the research speed is way too fast compared to the production rate and eureka system makes it even worse. But it's still a fun game to play and if you like 4X games, it's definitely worth it."
57,23.5,Recommended, January 13,1,"TLDR: Great game, 9/10, but some aspects are either left to be desired or previous Civilization games do better.First of all, what is this game for those of you who have not played the Civilization games before? It's a grand strategy game where you choose a nation/leader to begin playing in 4000 B.C. You expand, research, and progress forward through time, meeting other nations, forming alliances, fighting wars, and basically running your nation in whatever way you see fit. It's a fantastic game series for those looking for a grand strategy game.Mind you, there are many previous Civilization games that this builds off from. Honestly, from what I've experienced so far, there are a lot of great things that Civilization 6 has improved on! However, there are somethings that could be better/previous Civilization games did better.PROS:- Religion. In this game, religion seems much more organic and fluid, it's customizable to a great extent. And you can win a Religion victory by spreading your religion to all of the other nations. It was fun converting the whole world to The Kaleebian Faith.- Districts. Now some people may hate this, but I love them. You actually have to be careful where you put your cities and how close they are to your other cities. No longer can you just plop them anywhere and still get a decent production out of them. Having districts dedicated to specific tasks like industry or science is awesome to have. I can have one city in the tundra that may not have a whole lot of bonuses but because its on the shore and has like 2 fish and a crab resource nearby I can put a harbor district and capitalize on those resources. Meanwhile, a different city can be devoted to Science and Industry deeper within the continent. It gives each city a greater individual identity, rather than just being cities within my nation.- Casus Belli. This is a specific cause for war and oh my lord does this help with the AI problem. Mind you, the AI can still be troublesome (and I will touch on that in the CONS section), but it does help. If I want to go to war with a proper Casus Belli, it can greatly reduce my warmongering status among the other nations. For example, if I am Norway and declare war on Russia normally, I'll get a great warmongering status. However, if I am allied with America and Russia has conquered the American cities of New York and Baltimore, on behalf of the American Nation I can declare a Casus Belli of a Liberation War to give the cities of New York and Baltimore back to America. It gives me a way less warmongering penalty, and I can still conquer 1 or 2 Russian cities for myself and give back New York and Baltimore to America.- Civics. There are a ton more options to chose from, giving each game a different perspective on your government. You want to engage in a Holy War against Ghandi? Gear up your civics with a lot of faith benefits and the government Therocracy. Somebody giving you some problems early game but your like 2 continents away? Monarchy and boost your naval output with benefits to make your navy faster, better, and stronger. It's a nice touch to running your nation.- Personalities of different Leaders. This time around, leaders have individual goals that make them better friends with you if you lead the same way they do. However, this is both a PRO and CON. I'll explain the CON part in a second. Benefits though, if you tend to focus more on culture and science, you and Russia become the best of buds. More focused on industry and production? Japan loves you. Focused on the Economy? China is way more friendly. So depending on how you play the game, it can determine who is friend and who is disappointed in you.- Armies. Civilization 5 turned away from the endless ""stacks of death"" in Civilization 4, which I applaud. But Civilization 6 did it better. You can combine like units together to form an army, but can't endlessly stack them. So it's like a perfect balance between stacking units together and keeping them apart. You can't waltz in with 15 musketmen stacked in one tile and decimate a city, but you can still combine 3 to form an army and boost their damage a bit more.CONS- Resources are not limited. This is a personal grievance of mine. Civilization 5, I believe, did it right in limiting your resources. You had 6 Iron? You can only make 6 swordsmen. It eliminates the spamming of one unit and makes you utilize what you have, giving your military different kinds of troops and benefits. Civilization 6 does away with that unfortunately. With 1 niter resource, I can just keep spamming musketmen until I decide to do something else. I liked the idea to strategically create my military using what I had available. I had to choose how to use my resources very carefully.- City States. They are still here, which is awesome. But I felt that Civilization 5 had a better City State system than Civilization 6 does. In Civilization 5, you had to keep the city state's approval of you high with gifts, completing quests, and other tasks. In Civilization 6, you gain Envoys that you send to city states to better your relationship. The problem with this is that once a nation sends 6 envoys to a city state, it's pretty much their city state for the whole game. I liked the idea of Civilization 5's city state mechanic in that I can bribe and change the alliance of city states if they are allied with my enemy.- No Golden Age. I mean, the next expansion to Civilization 6 will include both a Golden Age and a Dark Age, but why were these missing from the vanilla game? I felt that a Golden Age was an important feature that allowed your nation to benefit from a great achievement for 10 turns, and could speed development up dramatically.- AI. Yes, unfortunately this is still a problem. You do one thing for your benefit, and everyone starts to denounce you. Everyone hates you. And heaven forbid if you declare a normal war on someone, you are a warmonger for all time. That's the other thing though, the AI never forgets! You declare war on China back in 1080 B.C., and everyone still calls you a warmonger in 1862 A.D. Diplomacy is shot if you go to war without a Casus Belli, and it honestly feels like the rest of the game ends up being you vs. everyone else.- Personalities of Different Leaders. Although there were some pros here, there are some cons. If you build a caravel and start exploring, England hates you because they want to always do that. If you found a religion, the Arabs and Spain will always hate you for starting a heretic religion and will be incredibly upset if your religion starts to spread to their cities. It makes the game feel a little repetitive if I keep♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off the same people for the same reason. Civilization 4 and 5 had a better system with giving each leader a specific benefit and goal, and no one would get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥at you if you started to do the same thing.- Style of Gameplay. I will not lie, I love this game. But compared to Civilization 5, it feels a little watered down. Not by much though. I mean, Civilization 5 has two big DLCs to bolster its experience, so I account for that.BOTTOM LINE:- This game is still a ton of fun! Mind you, when Civilization 5 came out, it didn't even have religion in the vanilla game, that came out with the Expansion Gods and Kings. So at this stage, it's hard to compare Civilization 6 with the previous iterations. If I had to pick one as the best Civilization game, I'd go with Civilization 5 with the 2 DLCs. But Civilization 6 will benefit greatly when the new DLC comes out in February. So if you're interested in this game and don't have any of the previous games, then BUY THIS GAME! But if you already own Civilization 5, wait until the DLC for Civilization 6 comes out or Civilization 6 is at a reduced price during a sale."
178,40.8,Recommended, January 1,1,"I was hesitant to buy this game as I heard a lot of negative feedback around the time of the game's launch. It has been over a year now and I can safely say that it is a fun experience. The main attraction to this game over previous iterations areDisctricts, and modding support in multiplayer, both of which allow for more interesting gameplay.I like most of the changes implemented in Civ VI including the ability to levy City State's military, requiring Wonders to take up a tile so you can't just spam them, and builders being limited to 3 uses and not able to be automated.Some things, however, are not done so well. Such as the AI and diplomacy. In one of my current games I get denounced like every 10 rounds by the congo for not spreading my religion to them. This is obviously annoying and pretty much forces me to send over a few missionaries.I have also found that the AI can just declare war fairly randomly at times, however this may just be due to my inexperience in the game.Overall I think Civ VI has improved since Civ V. I am sure this review missed some things, however I listed the features most important to me. I would suggest Civ VI, however I would probably advise to wait until its on sale for like $30 or lower."

30,59.6,Recommended, January 3,1,"Fearing that his Chinese neighbor will one day launch a rode from space on the Russian capital of St.Petersburg, Peter the great of Russia authorized his generals to wage a full on nuclear war against China. The first launch was a tactical nuke that targeted a recently captured German settlement where the Chinese had their mechanized infantry, artillary and tanks amassed near the Russian border. The next several launches however utilized Thermonuclear bombs that unleased destruction on Chinese cities and armies. The Russian army managed to penetrate 800 miles into Chinese territory before being stopped by irradiated fields that seperated it from the dying Chinese army. The launches continued over the next 5 years and primarly targeted three cities with space ports and their surrounding areas. After the space port cities where destroyed the launches where focused towords industrial towns towords Siberia and agricultural farms in the east. Peter the great wanted to make sure that these cities and their space ports could never rise again, that CHINA would never rise again.By the time of a ceasfire was signed, China has lost more than 90% of it's population and production. Radiation has reduced the acres of farmlands to rubble and the ones promising and thriving space centers have been reduced to molten piles of steel. Only the Chinese colonies in the Americas never experienced conflict. But as part of the ceasefire, the Chinese had to relinquish their American colonies aswell as a few towns close to the Russian border one of which luckly has a space port.The Russians quickly got underway to to decontaminate and rebuild the infrastrucure of their newly aquired prize. The Chinese however where not so lucky. With the loss of arable land and a complete destruction of its infrastructure, the Chinese economy tanked to the bottom. The government soon found itself unable to pay the wages of it's soldiers once memmbers of the largest amy in the world. The soldiers in turn sold their weapons on the black market or joined warlords who now roam free.The warlords pillaged Chinese villages as they pleased with no resistance from the Chinese government. Infact the warlords felt so confident that they started crossing into former Chinese territory and kidnapping Russian workers tasked with rebuilding the Russian side of the new territory. The Russian military had to be called to secure the border and to prevent intrusion from Chinese warlords. Peter certainly did not expect this as a side effect of his victory,20 years after the war not much had changed. Radiation has largely disappeard (no one knows why). The Chinese economy never recovered and warlords still roam the Chinese landscape with occasional attempts to enter the border. Chinese cities on the russian border have been rebuilt but have not recovered to pre-war levels. While the Chinese space ports rust on into history, the newely rebuilt Chinese-Russian space port on the other hand shows signs of promising. A few of the surviving and captured Chinese scientists and enginneers have been working with their Russian counterparts on launching the first Russian sattelite into space (more than 80 years since the Chinese went to Space).As he looks eastward from an army observation post near the border, Peter of Russia still wonders. Was it necessiary to drop the bombs on the great cities where innocent people ones thrived? Was it right to condmen the people of China into the hell and misery they live in? Peter after all got want he wanted but at what cost? Should the Russian government try to rebuild China either through refinancing the Chinese government or ""integration""? Or should China be left upto God and the mercy of those who rule her?"

When you get late into the game and most of the buildings you have are finished there is no real way to keep having to give your cities something to do like in Civ 5, In 5 i could just tell them to focus on wealth, culture, or production, and you can in a way in civ 6 but theres a turn limit. However when I started detroying my foes and taking their land my production shot through the roof and the turn limits on those focal points your civilization can focus at finish in one turn meaning you have to micromanage 15+ cities every turn which gets extremely tedious and slows the pace way down, especially if you are focusing on taking players out or just trying to end the turn."

In comparison to civ 6, civ 6 has pretty good load times, but the AI although better, is still pretty bad, what specifically bothers me about the AI in both games is that they dont seem to know the value of anything when trading. what i do like about diplomacy in civ 6 is that you can choose specific reasons to go to war with another civ for reduced warmonger penalties. also spying is better. What is worse about civ 6 is the user interface, everything seems overly complicated and i often cant figure out what specific things even do at all. in civ 5 i loved using the civilopedia to clarify things, but in civ6 it barely tells you anything.I was also looking at the rise and fall DLC coming out, and it looks terrible. looking at all the new game mechanics it adds, its just doesnt make sense, nothing it adds actually seems to change the game, they just look like extra things you have to worry about in an already overly complicated game(compared to civ 5). as opposed to civ5 and beyond earth DLC they actually add new game mechanics, beyond earth dlc added stuff like floating cities and civ 5 dlc added stuff like religion and trade routes that actually made the game better (civ 6 already has the same trade routes and religion mechanics btw). however the dlc does add new leaders and all but overall the civ6 dlc looks like garbage thatd make the game even worse.p.s. im only giving this game a thumbs up cus its $12 on humble bundle right now.p.s.p.s. also half the reason i got it is cus civ5 wont work on my desktop for somereason, its just broken"

124,142.6,Recommended," October 22, 2016",1,"Very much enjoying Civ VI. The pacing and the rate of technologies/civics is very well done. You actually have time to develop items unlocked from the research during this game and each one feels necessary to continue. In other civ games, I would sprint forward in research before even being able to build any buildings or units before the next tech was unlocked.I also really like the district mechanic. Each one has different buildings and reasons for being built. It definitely makes each city unique as some will be factory towns, some science/university and others entertainment cities and all flow well into the game.The diplomacy works well and is fairly logical. Different cultures do act differently towards the player depending on their agenda and can make each play through very unique.The AI looked horrible during the preview shows and very passive. It is better for the release however. I did have AI units come up and attack my units and cities. But the downside is there were never enough units to really cause me issues and the AI doesn’t have much of an understanding on how to use siege engines to take down a city, which is the same issue it had in Civ V. Several infantry units assaulting a walled city while catapults roll back and forth behind them without firing a shot.If you can get over the combat AI that was dropped as a subroutine, Civ VI is very enjoyable and provides lots of entertainment.8 out of 10"

The DLC are there if you want more, but quite frankly they are overpriced.Conclusion:I will reccomend this game to the people who like historical and/or turn based strategy games. For all else, you may want to do some more research."
160,175.7,Recommended," November 26, 2016",1,"Great game for someone new to CIV or the genre. It is very easy to follow in-game hints, and the game actually reminds you to take almost all the possible actions in a turn. Yet, as you progress in game, you do not face the fast growing actions-per-turn issue that many other strategy games suffer from. As someone who just wants to spend a whole day casually building an empire and see how the story unfolds, this is the game for me."

35,66.9,Recommended," November 26, 2016",1,"TL;DRInitial release of Civ VI: 7/10 vs Civ V 9.5/101. Many civilizations are restricted to certain playstyle, certain map conditions and certain ages. Such as Scythia or China. And the rest have trouble fighting back these specific strategies.2. The multiplayer needs many improvements. a) A faster game speed; b) Different modes/rules; c) More social elements.I have spent most of my college playing Civ V. Can't be more excited to lay my hands on the new released Civ VI. After a bunch of trails, I totally agree that the problems cause people to give downvotes are very true:1. AI(crappy at war tactics, broken diplomacy, and many others)2. UI(can't get to know some key-info, auto-focus jumping around)3. glitches & bugs(get rich by buy&sell units, win deity AI within 1-turn, freezes&frequent reloading at multiplayer, multi-language display).I have experienced all these annoy issues during my gameplay which makes me urge for patches. And I would like to add some points of my own:1. Many civilizations are restricted to certain playstyle, certain map conditions and certain ages. And the rest have trouble fighting back these specific strategies. For two examples:a. Scythian - would be your greatest nightmare if it's your neighbor and there's only plane or desert between you two in a multiplayer game started at ancient age. You have two choices: 1. Spend all your workforce building defenses and watch the rest world erecting wonders and cities so you lose in the long run. 2. Suppose he/she won't attack you and get overwhelmed by seas of horse archers so you lose quickly. However, if it is an island map or the game starts at a later age, play as Scythian would benefit little from its abilities and very likely to be defeated.b. China - the wonder rush strategy with workers at ancient/classical times would bring almost every wonder and make China almost undefeatable in the long run(You can even win deity AI with this). But this requires the game to start at ancient times, a good spawn meet all the requirements for the wonders(especially desert for the Pyramid) and not being the neighbor of someone like Scythian or Sumerian. On the other side, without the benefit of early wonders, China can hardly win a more all-round civ such as Japan or Rome in the late game with equally good plays.2. The multiplayer needs many improvements. Here're a few thoughts I have:a. A faster game speed. Even with online speed, it's still too slow for an online game. I would say it requires 10h+ to play against more than one human players for a complete game from the ancient times. (Though people usually know they can't win and quit much earlier) When playing against random people online, it would be almost impossible to save the game and reload it next time. So we do need a faster game speed.b. More game modes/different rules. The current gameplay is dominated by one thing: War. Your chance of winning a culture or science victory 100% peacefully is slim and religious victory is impossible as all your missionaries and apostles sent would be slain by force if you are close to one. Remember there is only one winner. And the rule-of-thumb is that: if you can take one city, then you can take the whole country; since there is no heavy penalty as happiness in Civ V. This makes the game experience war-oriented and monotonic: You start at attacking city-states and your neighbors, later clash large empires similar to yours and finally dominate all or very few superpowers left to pursuit a culture/science victory hindering each other with nukes. I would be very glad to see some different plays: such as an alliance of peace-loving small civs work closely together could stand still against a large warmongering one with tech/culture/economy power and walk together towards victory.c. Be more social. Though civ series have a tradition that most people spend most time play it alone with different scenarios, I strongly suggest civ series go more ""social"" because play with human players can be much more interesting than beating cheating and illogical AIs. This can be learned from many other successful games and I think it would definitely bring something new and fun to this legend game-series.In conclusion, I would say the initial release of Civ 6 is acceptable for a game with such high expectations from its series fans, but there is still a way to go to become another game of legend itself."
115,57.9,Recommended," October 23, 2016",1,"So, I am going to give Civ 6 a positive review. However, I am also going to recommend that you wait for amonth or two and check back at that time. Gameplay is stable, but there are a couple of minor issues that could use some tweaking.The Good Side:As a long time Civ player, I feel a throwback vibe to the days of Civ 2, which is a really cool thing. Don't ask me why, I just feel this vibe. The game is alot more indepth than previous iterations. There are now essentially 2 tech trees, one is tech and the other is civics. I'm not going to take the time to go in depth to the system, but it works.Additionally, trade routes are here again and they are really cool. The diplomacy system is new and cool also.And one more thing that I noticed that I want to mention here - There seems to be, in my opinion, alot more emphasis on the middle game than previous iterations.While the AI is functional, and even challenging, there is a learning curve with it. I ""feel"" as though I don't have enough control in diplomacy. Don't get me wrong, the diplomacy is cool, it just feels like the AI isn't quite all there. I think that this will probably change in a few months with patching.Additionally, and I hesitate to put this forth as a con: There is quite the learning curve. This is somewhat good though, because it indicates the depth of the game.Lastly, there are some minor tidbits that need to be patched, but certainly nothing to write home about.A must have for any long time CIv player. The ""feeling"" of the game very much reminds me of civ 2. I do wonder if tiles instead of hexes would have been better here, but it's really no big issue. Be prepared for a learning curve, even if you are a veteran Civ player.I would recommend that you wait for a couple of months an/or for a steam sale to get this game, unless of course you are a Civ junkie, in which case absolutely get it now. It's good. It's not blow your socks off good, nor is it just ""kinda good"". It's good. Don't know how else to explain it."

My fav game of all time is Civ V and this game doesnt even get close to being as good as Civ 5. The dumbing down of the mechanics and the graphics to a mobile game level and than releasing Civ VI for iPad showed their true intention. Movement feels clunky, optimization is bad, game is full of bugs and lacks variety. Whoever I play as or against it feels the same with minor changes.This review is before the release of the (overpriced) Rise&Fall Expansion. Im hoping that they can save the game in the eyes of veteran civ players."

Some of the things I don't like about this one is ->1. The fog of war sucks. In order to make it stylish, they have made it impossible to differentiate between grasslands, plain, hills etc. I am not sure if that was intended amd makes sense.2. Religion view is bad. If you select any religious unit, it is difficult to see the underlying terrain properly. You can't figure out where the roads are.3. Too many bugs still left. If multiple sciences get boost in one turn, then sometimes the popup message shows the same one every time."
1,57.0,Recommended," November 23, 2016",1,"Civilization (the first one) was the first game I stayed up past bedtime playing as a child. This is the first game since then I've stayed up until dawn playing without planning to. Districts and wonders taking up space are really going to shake up the formula. Some balancing adjustments still need to be made, but all in all, it's really good, keeping most of the new gameplay ideas from the Civilization V expansion packs. I wish the religious victory didn't count cities conquered, as I accidentally lost a game by capturing too many of someone elses cities though."
53,5.0,Recommended," October 20, 2016",1,"Positives:- It's relatively polished.- It runs well.- Excellent music and graphics.- All of the mechanics of Gods & Kings + Brave New World are included as base content in Civilization VI (albeit modified), no feature stripping for the sake of future expansion pack sales.- It's Civ, it's addictive and good fun.Criticisms:- I do not like how the leaders look. Their proportions are odd and too cartoony for me. They also need more voiced dialogue.- The AI has absolutely no idea how to go to war. They will attack me with horribly outdated or unsuitable units. I will have spearmen and they will rush in with a dozen mounted units. If their units lose health, they will retreat or replace them with a full health unit. I can win with a horrible army by picking off one or two of their units.- The UI is bad. Everything feels squished together and vague.- Missing or broken game options (auto cycling units, buggy edge scrolling, no WASD camera)- The AI is dumb about win conditions. No one has captured any capitals, and they have bad science & culture per turn. I'm no Civ beginner, but I didn't expect to be winning in science in my first ever match when I was not playing strategically at all, just getting an idea of what's new.-----------------------------Overall:I will still recommend Civ VI because it is good fun, but there needs to be some patching of the major problems."

There are no build queues for cities. There does not appear to be key binding for units to fortify until healed.Some new concepts have been added, although I've not played long enough to decide if I think they are well done or not.Overall, I am disappointed with it and will probably stick to Civilization 5."

44,37.7,Not Recommended," December 17, 2016",1,"They added a few features and made a few things more tedious since Civ V. Maintaining multiple cities and trade routes in the end game make the game unplayable due to monotony. There is no option for last trade route and you can't set cities to just produce gold like you did in Civ V. You have to keep resetting the city options now.The district system adds some strategy to building and religious combat is a bit more fun, but it doesnt make up for the tediousness of endgame. I find myself wanting to play but dreading the tediousness. I can't recommend the game until those things are fixed.Another problem is that the map fog is very dull. Instead of a darkened version of the map, it is just a boring, brown cartography map now.Hopefully DLCs and patches will fix this game."

224,265.2,Recommended," December 2, 2016",1,Civ VI improves on alot of features from the Civ V expansions such as a Civics tech tree in addition to a Technology tree and the new district system. While the new diplomacy features of each leader's specific goal and the reasons for war are improvments the leaders are still somewhat erratic and difficult to please (though the patch helped some) and war is very discouraged by war weariness. Overall the game is great fun and very satisfying and if you enjoyed previous Civ games you will be able to loose hundreds of hours in this one.
136,174.7,Not Recommended," December 17, 2016",1,This game has great potential however at the current state it sadly suffer from various annoying bugs and an AI that needs more work.

So my recommendation is to wait with a purchase until the game has received more fixes from the developers.
215,506.4,Recommended," November 2, 2016",1,"Is Civ6 a perfect game? No.Is it a fun game? YesI have played every iteration of Civilization and with every change over there are complaints and issues. These are all fair enough, as things we have loved are changing. But, over time, they will sort themselves out as get used to them.Of all the vanilla releases of Civ this is, by far, the deepest. There are new mechanics and concepts that really take the series in a good direction, such as districts and AI agendas. However, they really need to polish the game a bit more, as some of these great ideas have issues (eg it can be very hard to keep anyone liking you, and there may be no way to prevent it. The warmonger penalty may be excessive. etc).But there is one GLARING negative. The AI. Civ4 and 5 both suffered with horrendous AI upon release, and 6 continues this trend. The AI is PATHETIC. They often refuse to attack, instead shuffling their units about infront of your army while being massacred by ranged attacks. They don't seem to use districts overly well... it's not thought out to flow across the empire. Instead being a random mix that doesn't necessarily help them. And it's plain too easy to win, even on the hardest difficulties.Complaints about the art style will likely fade. People hated Civ4's art initially, but now love it. It is just jarring when you look at something you are not used to. Yes, it could use some touch ups as it can be hard to distinguish hills, but overall it looks amazing.Will this get better? Yes. Civ 4 and 5 had similar issues and they were ironed out. Civ6 is still very playable and very fun. It's not up to the standards of Civ4 BTS, or Civ5 BNW, but let's not forget they had 2 expansions and then almost a year of patches to become the masterpieces they ended up being."

(Though I still feel that Teddy looks more like Taft.) The new unit system is an improvement over Civ5, however there are still some things that are lacking. Unit diversity for one, there simply aren't a lot of different units. This could change through time with the game though, more civilizations and leaders could mean more units, and more technologies.Another good point is that Civ6 returns to an old concept with Civ4. Multiple leaders for each civilization creates new play styles, and reintroduces the concept of a power struggle within a culture. This should also make for some very interesting Community mods as well."

169,477.1,Recommended," July 19, 2017",1,"This game could have been incredible and it still has some fun value to it, but it fails in several ways for me. Fortunately a simple mod download fixes a lot of their issues. I have no idea who programs and approves the User Interface for Civ games, but they need some serious help. There are so many wasted clicks and quality of life enhancements that are simple, I daresay known through out the community yet fail to appear in Civ 6. But a search for the most popular mod for UI interface will make this game 100% better.The second issue is their diplomacy system. They had a good ideas, maybe, but I have no clue what they thought was being implemented. The AI hate you for ridiculous things. Not expanding fast enough, some civ's hate you. Expanding? Some civs hate you. Building wonders? LOTS of civs hate you. It is horrible and makes no sense, just like the little screens that pop up from other civs that kind of have no reason to be there.You can pretty much forget about the entire diplomacy and AI sections of the game, most Civ games suffer from this and still go on to be great, fun games. It's just a same Civ 6 didn't improve on it and actually became worse. We'll see what the next paid expansion does (and they need to reign in their corporate greed at this point...the next paid expansion had better not be another whopping $60...*grumble*)Anyway, this game still has some fun and good times ahead of it, but it falls flat without a good UI mod. That is how important a good User Interface is, a little more horrible and it would have been a game breaker for me.I would recommend this game at $40. I would NOT pay $60 for this game and won't do so again for any civ game in the future. Nothing so special here that it calls for a $60 price tag. You still need to pony up almost another $20 on top of it to get the extra civs they've released so far."

Upon getting to the ending screen and excited to see that at least, there was no reason given to my loss.

It's ok just kinda feels like they took most the civs and options away that were in V to give you whatever this is, districts? I guess I'd call it barely ok? Doesn't feel like theres enough there like its a cheap version of what it should've been. Maybe it will be worth it a year or two down the line when they work everything out with bugs and ai with all dlc included on sale."
115,57.9,Recommended," October 23, 2016",1,"So, I am going to give Civ 6 a positive review. However, I am also going to recommend that you wait for amonth or two and check back at that time. Gameplay is stable, but there are a couple of minor issues that could use some tweaking.The Good Side:As a long time Civ player, I feel a throwback vibe to the days of Civ 2, which is a really cool thing. Don't ask me why, I just feel this vibe. The game is alot more indepth than previous iterations. There are now essentially 2 tech trees, one is tech and the other is civics. I'm not going to take the time to go in depth to the system, but it works.Additionally, trade routes are here again and they are really cool. The diplomacy system is new and cool also.And one more thing that I noticed that I want to mention here - There seems to be, in my opinion, alot more emphasis on the middle game than previous iterations.While the AI is functional, and even challenging, there is a learning curve with it. I ""feel"" as though I don't have enough control in diplomacy. Don't get me wrong, the diplomacy is cool, it just feels like the AI isn't quite all there. I think that this will probably change in a few months with patching.Additionally, and I hesitate to put this forth as a con: There is quite the learning curve. This is somewhat good though, because it indicates the depth of the game.Lastly, there are some minor tidbits that need to be patched, but certainly nothing to write home about.A must have for any long time CIv player. The ""feeling"" of the game very much reminds me of civ 2. I do wonder if tiles instead of hexes would have been better here, but it's really no big issue. Be prepared for a learning curve, even if you are a veteran Civ player.I would recommend that you wait for a couple of months an/or for a steam sale to get this game, unless of course you are a Civ junkie, in which case absolutely get it now. It's good. It's not blow your socks off good, nor is it just ""kinda good"". It's good. Don't know how else to explain it."
214,358.9,Recommended," November 23, 2017",1,"An excellent game, with well crafted and distinct Civilizations, and more game-changing decisions each turn than its predecessors. Yet somehow, it just doesn't have the 'one more turn' draw of Civilization V. A strong title, but still needs a little work to stand out from its peers."

198,113.7,Not Recommended," October 21, 2016",1,"Civilization is the strategy game for people who don't like strategy games. That being said, it's a fun game, if somewhat dull at times. I've been playing Civilization since Civilization II and have seen it develop in extensive ways over the years. Civilization has become large enough for it to be that ""Basic White Girl"" strategy game it always dreamed to be, largely in thanks to Civilization V.Is it deserving of it? Well...Civilization will probably always be a good, but not great, game (if you ignore Beyond Earth). The design is intuitive and it's typically really easy to get into and it tries to keep it that way. VI managed to shrug off criticism that it will just be another vanilla template to build off with paid expansions.That being said, it struggles immensely in some areas. The AI was easily the worst part about Civilization V. The interaction menus in VI are improved and offers new political choices, but they are actually even worse than they were in V, behavior-wise.My other issue lies with districts. I think they should be adjacent plots to a city, if they are to exist at all. They are very time-consuming to develop and the district limits by population don't really offer any layer of strategy. Cool concept, and that's about all it has gonig for it right now.If Civ did anything right this go around, they showed other developers what not to do in their DLC mentality. A single Civilization is equal to 8% to cost of the entire game. Buying all available DLC Civilizations as of 1/8/2018 runs a price tag of $32 for 7 Civilizations, while the Rise and Fall expansion is $30.All in all Civilization is alright. Fans of the series or players who don't want a deeper strategy experience will like this game. Avid strategy players like myself will probably not be able to maintain interest. I also wouldn't recommend if you're that guy who never ends his/her turn."
220,43.6,Recommended," December 31, 2016",1,"I really like the changes they've made from Civ 5. The graphics are great, the policies are done way better so that it actually adds an element of strategy, religion is in the base game. Now we just need the SDK to come out to add some more buildings!"
38,41.1,Recommended," December 31, 2016",1,"If you have played Civ V like I have then you will realize quite a few changes from that game to this one. Even so, the changes are easy and simple to get use to. After playing this game for a couple of hours, I went back to Civ 5 because my friends who didn't have Civ VI wanted to play Civ V with me and it was weird at first going back since that Civilization games are different in a good way. I love this latest Civilization game and I completely recommend it to anyone and everyone!"
177,221.9,Not Recommended, February 16,1,CIV PEACE! Getting tired of not being able to wage war. This is now CiviliPEACE. The game is forcing you to not war and conquor. And now with the new DLC it's even harder with city alegence etc. Mind you the AI so so dumb that when I did attack everyone they couldn't even defend. Once you distory their units you just seige their cities and distory their civ. The issue is is if you keep the cities now they all rebel.
13,112.9,Not Recommended, February 16,1,"Frustrating mechanics and dire need of balance. Espionage interface needs to be reworked as well - way too many notifications IN YA FACE.

636,348.8,Recommended," November 23, 2016",1,"Sometimes a sequel launches so poorly that it takes three years to reach the same level of polish as its predecessor. Sometimes the designer of a Civ title is so grossly incompetant that the game suffers from their bad designs for its entire life cycle. And sometimes, we forget just how difficult building a Civ game engine from scratch must be.CIvilization VI is not one of these games, and it's designer is not one of those designers. The game suffers from several defects related to being built on a customized in-house engine. The game lacks polish in several areas. The user interface lacks critical information about how certain mechanics work. The game needs changes, of course.But it is entirely worth every penny spent on this game. Even with all the problems it has, it's still very enjoyable. It makes previous Vanilla Civ releases feel subpar, especially the mess that was Civ 5 at launch. The multiplayer works better at launch than Civ 5's did after its final patch.Personally, I expected the issues we have with this game. It's brand new, and we're comparing it to Civ 5 with 2 expansions and 15+ patches. In a few years, this game will be leaps and bounds ahead of where it is now, and I'm excited to see what comes next!"
121,17.8,Recommended," October 23, 2016",1,"I'm biased... This was the first series of games I played at the age of 7, because I found it on my mom's laptop while she was at work and just always played it. I've grown up playing games, every genre really. This has become my all-time favorite game, period. I'm not sure theres another game that's captivated my interest for 14 hours straight, into the night, then again the very next day right after I woke up and ate. Fallout has gotten close, but at that point I was just mindlessly droning. I always felt like, and feel like, I'm accomplishing something in Civ 6. The greatest part is, Civ always has new expansions that manage to add more to an already vast game, although my expectations were exceeded, it's odd to say I expect my expectations to continue to be exceeded.TLDR; Buy this game. It's worth it."
31,353.3,Recommended," October 23, 2016",1,"Recommend if you want something new in civilization. Not really recommend for player who really love civ 5, no changing city name, can't stop increase population of city the best you can is make them have no growth, no mods, no additional maps, too little option for creating your own game. Sometimes AI really make no sense just like when allied end and relationship is very friendly they just declare war out of nowhere. Overall the game is very bold in takeing the next step especially the diplomatic which kinda very deep that make civ 5 diplomatic looks like child play. And graphic is really good still wonder when they will release DX12 version as they state before. Just a bit lag when I tried to exit the game really need to use task manager everytime. LOL"

445,15.1,Recommended," October 23, 2016",1,"I have some good things and some bad things to say about this new civ game. First of all, the positives:- It's finally a MODERN civ game with no graphic glitches on modern win 10 systems and it runs natively in 64 bits. Everything runs extremely well at max settings (4K res, all grfx settings at max.)- I LOVE the districts and that you can make every city different and unique. I also love that you control population directly, by building neighborhoods.- I love the new animations for movement and combat.- I love that the game is still extremely customizable just like civ 5. I like that I can start in any era and that I can customize the map and the game as much as I want. Unfortunately, playing on planet Earth seems to be missing, and that's the map I always use with civ 5.- I love the improved diplomacy and the new spy management section.Now for what I don't like:- Buildings and military units are MUCH HARDER to obtain. You have to play for at least 5-6 hours before you can even start considering attacking another nation. And even with resources set at max, strategic resources are MUCH HARDER to come by. Which means you'll be a lot less inclined to risk units on daring tactics, because rebuilding them would be prohibitive.- The AI is insane. Computer-controlled nations declare war on me all the time, for no reason (really? Rome is angry at me for building 30 hexes away from their closest city?) I found myself at war with 5-6 nations, none of them allied. That makes absolutely NO SENSE.- What's with the random comments on my civ from other nations? The same useless comments that repeat over and over and that don't lead to anything other than a ""goodbye"" button. Talk about a gratuitous waste of my time!- Why oh why are workers expended after they only built three things? And why have they become a lot harder to get? In civ 5 I'm used to hundreds of workers building and fixing things. Now even workers have become a luxury? It takes at least 10 hours before your biggest city with all the fixings can produce a worker unit every turn.- I don't particularly like the more cartoonish diplomacy animationd. I want to deal with people, not cartoons. It's pretty hard for me to take them seriously when they look like Manga characters...I don't know if I can recommend it. Unfortunately there is no neutral option, so it's either yes or no. Hopefully new versions will take care of the shortcomings and that's why I decided to recommend it. But not if you buy it right now (as in 10/23/2016.)FOR NOW IT'S **NOT** RECOMMENDED."
448,148.5,Recommended," October 23, 2016",1,Nice and fresh take on Civ. Really enjoy the fact that you have to plan out your cities more than in previous Civs where you just spam every tile with farms and mines around cities that have 15 wonders built in them because that's where all your production is.
36,106.1,Recommended," October 23, 2016",1,"Have played around 30 hours of this game in 4 days and have loved it.Even the graphics which I didn't like at first have grown on me and I can't help but be in awe at some of the views I get.There is still but of fine tuning to the AI to be done, but I understand that the AI for a game like this must be pretty complicated to code for.I've so far played a science game and a diplomatic game & a domination game and enjoyed both varieties.I really look forward to what else is put into the game."

574,266.4,Recommended," November 25, 2017",1,"I have largely enjoyed Civ 6 so far, it perhaps isn't the complete package yet, like most Civ releases it tends to require a couple of expansions before fully rounded out and realised to its full potential.Having said that, they have transitioned nicely to the new city tile system, with districts and wonders built separately outside of the single city tile, an idea quite foreign to previous Civ titles!Multiplayer seems quite stable, without desync issues like 5.As usual you will likely find you start more games than you finish but it's a good game for chilling out for several hours over Discord as you put the world to rights whilst growing your Civilisation.The updates made to the game are slow but meaningful, adjusting the outright unreasonable AI from the initial release to a more strategic opponent and using the Civ's likes and dislikes system to a greater effect.Overall it's a game i look forward to seeing how it evolves, perhaps with a world congress like system to spice up the late game, and with more Civilisations added over time to help bolster the numbers!"
334,13.6,Recommended," November 29, 2016",1,"Nice game, interesting new solutions, solid arts, nice town animation. Great soundtrack by the way. It's hard to compare different versions of Civilization games. Every game has unique balance setting. This game is interesting to play - that's what I can say for sure.So I totally recommend it.Minors:- UI. Sometimes it's terrible. You have to click at that city many times before you can select it. Sometimes UI glitch (I have ""new regime available"" instead of ""next turn"" - works as shoud, an animation bug).- Eats a lot of RAM and does not want to exit without killing the process.- Units sometimes got lost in the middle of a route.

51,150.6,Recommended, January 30,1,"A worthy sequel to Civ V, but lacking many of the refinements that were built into the expansions for it. However it is still a great base game with very refined battle mechanics.The non-battle strategies feel lacking at the moment, like wonder building, or focusing on science.They still have not fixed simple issues like unit-cycling Vs no cycling (Why not simply have ""nearest unit first-cycling"")The A.I. is still absurd, and this makes it feel less immersive than Civ IV. It constantly makes absurd claims that make me feel like I'm playing a board game with simple logic, instead of a theoretically well programmed game.All that aside, there is a lot that is good, and if you like any previous Civ game you will like this. There is just so much that could be simply fixed to make the game immersive, rather than just compettitive.I'm reccomending it, and have done so with many friends who are now Civ junkies.Cannot wait for expansions and AI tweaks (but historically they never manage to make the AI much better)"

A nearby NPC town is unhappy and is spawning groups upon groups of rebels that are the same if not better than my current units in terms of strength. They do not attack the original town or pillage anything related to the town they are rebelling from. Instead they rather travel 8-10 titles away to pillage my stuff and kill my units. The thought next is to just take over the rebelling town, however I can't go to war as I'll get a massive war mongering status and all the other NPC players in the game will go against me.Thus all I can do is just keep losing units, repair, hold off, and hope this NPC fixes his town which I doubt he'll be able to do because its a terribly placed town to begin with.

Each Civ did something different, and 6 did cities completely different. Is it worth Steam Sale? Definitely. Is it worth full price? Yes, if you love 4x games for the building aspect but not so much on the fighting strategy.I was very dissapointed in initial release with religion being useless and the AI not trying to win as the most obvious deterrents. The current release (with all the additional civilization DLC's) feels like a full game, but it comes at the cost of DLC's which is my main complaint. If you want a game that feels huge, get Civ 3. If you want a competitive multiplayer experience, get Civ 5. If you are like me and enjoy these games for the building over several evenings' play, you'll love Civ 6."

At 150 hours, I feel like I've worn through most of the fun. I rarely finish the games now, not even worried about achievements that much, just because the AI is so bad. They get mad if you do something, they get mad if you don't do something, they declare war for no reason but have no troops to fight you... Heaven forbid you declare war on anyone, because that means you're the worst person IN THE WORLD. But, then again, that still doesn't mean anything, if you build a proper army, they can't even touch you.As of right now, I wouldn't recommend the game to anyone who already has Civ V.

From the get go, CIV VI has great new mechanics and refreshed old ones in interesting ways, all done expertly. Even though it still has a few kinks to iron out, such as a broken trading system, an envoy system that feels a little out of my control, a constant apostle spamming and predictable AI (higher difficulty practically only buffs the AI through bonuses instead of changing mechanics).

306,217.1,Recommended," November 23, 2016",1,"Best game of the franchise, I've played 3,4,5, and BE, and now this, and I can easily say that this builds upon the strengths and failings of the past games and is honestly the high point of the series, all of you complaining about the graphics ""going backwards"" are wrong, Cartoonish graphics hold up more in the long run than realistic graphics, and ths game feels no where near like a mobile game as I saw in some reviews. I love how their is sooooo much content on release unlike civ 5 and Beyond Earth. There is only one problem that I have and that is the AI is still kind of dumb and easy to deal with, and Firaxis/2k STOP GIVING THE AI ADDITIONAL STARTING STUFF AT HIGHER DIFFICULTIES JUST MAKE THE AI SMARTER AT HIGHER DIFFICULTIES!!! Additional starting stuff is just plain unfair! But still a good game, planning on having double what I currently have in civ 5 after 6 years, and In one month I'm already about half way to having the same time played in BE after one year. Currently in my rotation of games that I play right now and will be for several months most likely :)"
922,68.1,Recommended," November 23, 2016",1,"My favorite iteration of Civilization yet (have been playing since IV) due to the new way that cities work with districts. The art direction of the game has changed since the last version of Civ and I can see why it's controversial, but it's not an issue for me. This game looks reminiscent of Civilization Revolution.What I've enjoyed in particular in this version are the campaigns, which are objective-based missions which unfold at an accelerated pace, over 50 turns. They vastly speed up the pace of Civilization which can sometimes feel slow. About a month after release Firaxis released an update for Civ VI which added a new campaign which is great - this is encouraging. Hoping for more good updates which bring new content!"
168,7.6,Recommended," October 25, 2016",1,"Such a fun and amazing game after CIV V to be fair it does take a little while to get used to with playing CIV V a lot but all in all this is a game worth buying, to all the people moaning on how the AI declares war or isn't always happy with you, just simply keeps a tab on all the things e.g. troops, resources, agenders and make sure not to do something that will p*ss them off, when you click on them it even tells you what will p*ss them off and make them friendlier. But this is just my review and you yourself can judge the game, despite what other reviews say, i didn't take any advice from them and i just went out a bought the game as i was intended to regardless. The game is not the same as CIV V with the builders not been permanent and various other changes but, who wants another CIV V anyway we needed change and CIV VI provided.In conclusion, i personally would recommend this game but it's completely up to you to buy the game."

448,191.4,Recommended," November 23, 2016",1,"A worthy successor to the Civ series. Unlike previous versions of Civ, very few features were dropped and you don't need to wait for expansions for a complete game.There are certainly flaws that will be improved with patches or expansions.

90,171.0,Recommended," October 25, 2016",1,"I had removed CIV5 from my ""playlist"" in favour of Paradox' titles, as they just felt more engaging after thousands of hours of CIV over the years, but I was of course still excited to try out CIV6. So far, some 40-50 hours in (EDIT: Apparently I'm just over 100 hours in, how the time flies), I've not been disappointed!My major takeaways, positive and negative, so far:1. I am no longer punished for building wide - wow what a feeling!2. The music is great, and it's dynamic aspects works perfectly almost making me feel like part of an epic movie.3. I like the new tech boost system, but it's still too early to tell if it's actually good for the game or not. If an optimal strategy can be found the new system might be more limiting than it is rewarding.4. However, the civets/policy system I feel adds a great deal and is a step forward.5. I like the attention made to the diplomacy system in general, but it still needs a lot of polish and tweaks. It can get quite annoying that you can never be friends with the AI unless you give them incredible bribes and also toe the line of their diplomatic agendas perfectly.6. I encountered quite a few bugs with the UI. However, no performance problem on my 2 year old machine (GPU is a GTX760).Overall I will have a lot of fun with this. Better than CIV5? Sure, why not - but I don't know if it will last as long as CIV5 did in it's present state, but I'm hopeful future updates will make it so. My favourite CIV is still CIV4 though :)"

This can be overwhelming and frustrating, though, but it is a plus once you get the hang of the districts and tile placements. I also enjoy the commentary on the wonders and watching them be built.There are many positive things on this game that beat Civ 5 and the only a few negatives. I would say that barbarians can be pretty harsh in this one, but you can work around that. There is also not an initial ally button to become allies with friends, so that is a turn off as well. The rest of the negatives just have to do with needing more civs to play as and more maps, but that will come with mods and expainsions."

Just a step foward.Civ6 seems in contrast like a over-colour-contrasted stylised throwback into past Civs. Yeah, its a 25th anniversary of Civ so it visually harkens back to Civs of the past (with Civ5 being the outlier in that regard) with the exeption of playstyle and features... and dont get me wrong, gameplay wise, its still a step fowards - just artistically, its a step backwards.But that didnt stop me from buying a physical collectors edition :)Its a Sid Meier game.

121,17.8,Recommended," October 23, 2016",1,"I'm biased... This was the first series of games I played at the age of 7, because I found it on my mom's laptop while she was at work and just always played it. I've grown up playing games, every genre really. This has become my all-time favorite game, period. I'm not sure theres another game that's captivated my interest for 14 hours straight, into the night, then again the very next day right after I woke up and ate. Fallout has gotten close, but at that point I was just mindlessly droning. I always felt like, and feel like, I'm accomplishing something in Civ 6. The greatest part is, Civ always has new expansions that manage to add more to an already vast game, although my expectations were exceeded, it's odd to say I expect my expectations to continue to be exceeded.TLDR; Buy this game. It's worth it."

445,15.1,Recommended," October 23, 2016",1,"I have some good things and some bad things to say about this new civ game. First of all, the positives:- It's finally a MODERN civ game with no graphic glitches on modern win 10 systems and it runs natively in 64 bits. Everything runs extremely well at max settings (4K res, all grfx settings at max.)- I LOVE the districts and that you can make every city different and unique. I also love that you control population directly, by building neighborhoods.- I love the new animations for movement and combat.- I love that the game is still extremely customizable just like civ 5. I like that I can start in any era and that I can customize the map and the game as much as I want. Unfortunately, playing on planet Earth seems to be missing, and that's the map I always use with civ 5.- I love the improved diplomacy and the new spy management section.Now for what I don't like:- Buildings and military units are MUCH HARDER to obtain. You have to play for at least 5-6 hours before you can even start considering attacking another nation. And even with resources set at max, strategic resources are MUCH HARDER to come by. Which means you'll be a lot less inclined to risk units on daring tactics, because rebuilding them would be prohibitive.- The AI is insane. Computer-controlled nations declare war on me all the time, for no reason (really? Rome is angry at me for building 30 hexes away from their closest city?) I found myself at war with 5-6 nations, none of them allied. That makes absolutely NO SENSE.- What's with the random comments on my civ from other nations? The same useless comments that repeat over and over and that don't lead to anything other than a ""goodbye"" button. Talk about a gratuitous waste of my time!- Why oh why are workers expended after they only built three things? And why have they become a lot harder to get? In civ 5 I'm used to hundreds of workers building and fixing things. Now even workers have become a luxury? It takes at least 10 hours before your biggest city with all the fixings can produce a worker unit every turn.- I don't particularly like the more cartoonish diplomacy animationd. I want to deal with people, not cartoons. It's pretty hard for me to take them seriously when they look like Manga characters...I don't know if I can recommend it. Unfortunately there is no neutral option, so it's either yes or no. Hopefully new versions will take care of the shortcomings and that's why I decided to recommend it. But not if you buy it right now (as in 10/23/2016.)FOR NOW IT'S **NOT** RECOMMENDED."
448,148.5,Recommended," October 23, 2016",1,Nice and fresh take on Civ. Really enjoy the fact that you have to plan out your cities more than in previous Civs where you just spam every tile with farms and mines around cities that have 15 wonders built in them because that's where all your production is.

85,201.9,Not Recommended, February 8,1,"Though I quite enjoy the game, I find it difficult to recommend any non-Windows version due to its repeated status as an afterthought by Firaxis, with OS X and Linux often waiting two months after a patch release date to receive it. This is culminated in Firaxis' shambolic release of Rise and Fall, offering and *optimistic* non-Windows date of If Firaxis wants to boast about their support across multiple operating systems (and promise cross platform play which is still pending more than a year and four months after release), then they need to at least put a little bit more effort into treating the non-Windows versions as more than an afterthought for Aspyr to clean up.I don't know what changed between V and VI, but this repeated bait and switch has burned through all the good will that they'd generated with their promise of continual multi-system support, and is frankly embarassing from a company that wants to bill itself as triple A."

Beyond that, seeing what the ""Deluxe"" version includes, I think I will wait for a ""Game of the Year"" edition ... or just pass altogether. I am NOT paying $70+ for this one. It just isn't worth it to me, and I feel for those who paid up $80 originally thinking they would get the expansion as part of said version were hosed."
142,834.8,Not Recommended, February 8,1,"Stop starting, start finishing Firaxis!We have a group that is frequently meeting to play civ rounds.Civ 6 so far is 90% efford into single player and new features that can be sold. Multiplayer only exists so they can say ""we have that too"".Some very big features from single player were not taken over to multiplayer.A lot of things that don't matter so much in single player, but that can make Multiplayer senseless don't get fixed.What exactly do I speak of?1. Save/Load Configuration. You implemented it in single player. Unless devs have no clue what they do, it should be a no brainer to implement that functionality into Multiplayer lobbies.2. Restart: Okay, not everybody should be able to trigger a restart on round 1. BUT why not making a multiplayer restart? Without save/load it is a pain to reconfigure everything if once again somebody landed on a 3 field island, a desert or next to ice.3. Balanced start positions: Yes there is already a feature with that name. But it does obviously not work. Typical multiplayer setting is islands or continents. You play with 4 players get placed on 4 completely different sized islands. A bit randomness is okay, But if one player can immediately place 8 cities on his island and another one can place just one more before he heeds to research shipbuilding and must hope to find some new land somewhere, that is ruining EVERY competitive multiplayer game. Versus AIs that is not much of a problem, Civ 5 and especially Civ 4 had MUCH better map generators.4. The whole damn UI: Yes it looks fancy. High res and everything. But I would trade the fancy bling bling UI for a Civ 4 UI anytime. Now with the new Rise and Fall the CQUI Mod is broken again unfortunately, so we are forced to deal with the stupid game UI. Just pay the CQUI team a fair price and implement their mod into the full game.PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE before making more content that is improving the game little work on making the UI more functional. Check the CQUI mod. Implement a build queue, Implement a build menu where you need less clicks and get a better overview than you have now. Also very usefull are demographics and the event handling that CQUI makes.5. AI is more stupid than ever before in Civ 6: Some improvements were already made, but diplomacy is a huge huge problem. Simply buying cities with money in peace negotiations was worse a few months ago, but it still is bad. Also expanding and district placement is pretty bad.6. Maps: Make better maps. In Civ 4 there were options like Island (1 big and several small islands per player). In general you need fair chances for all participants in a multiplayer game.7. Multiplayer Lobby Bugs: Fix them please. Inviting players for games does occasionally not work when you invite multiple players quickly. One of them gets stuck in the loading screen, has to restart his game and when he joins over the steam friend himself all works fine.Implement the game critical mods or make absolutely sure that the mods work when you make updates. Your game is so bad that it needs mods to make it playable like older Civ games."

5,"1,280.9",Not Recommended, February 22,1,"I have reverted back to CIV V.I have tried the game and find CIV VI to be slow and overbearing. Building city improvements take too long. First one must build the district to put improvements in then you must build the buildings. WHY?Next workers can only make 3 os so improvements then they disappear. Why?In the past versions, and I have played them all, once you create a worker, you kept it forever. What is the purpose of making them disappear other than to slow down the game play?What is the purpose of the districts other than to take up space on the map and hide resources? A city which always has only taken one spot on the map now takes several spaces and countless turns to develope the ""districts"". It slows the game down and quite honestly makes it boring for me to play.Building a military and actually using it makes you the worst type of ruler, ie a warmonger to every other player in the game...even friends. The time it takes to try and improve one's reputation is not worth it so one plays the game not reaping any benefits.Honestly, I do not like what has been done to the game and really feal I have wasted my money. You can look at my hours played in relation to the hours I still spend playing CIV V and there really is no comparison.There could be some selections put in the game set up which would eliminate the concepts of the game which one finds undesirable.I'm sure there are some interestig aspects to the game but I have not found a good enough reason to go through an entire game and see if it gets better. I am not sure if I have finished a game yet, but if I have that tells you how memorable it was not.I hate being this negative about any CIV game. I have owned them all up to this point, but I have not bought any expansion or considered buying one for this seies. For now I will wait for CIV VII if there is one and I'm sure I will be behind the power curve on game play b ut for now I will stick with CIV V."
606,83.6,Recommended," November 23, 2016",1,"It's Civ, a frequent player of the franchise will feel right at home.It's kept the same Hexagonal tiles for the world as in 5, and continues to work well. I barely remember playing Civ on square tiles from 4 and previous. The changes made from 5 have worked in some ways but not in others, The ways to win have been changed, personally I think they've got this wrong. Science is harder to achieve, which is my personal preferred way to win and I actually win by culture instead when shooting for science. A lot of people have stated that the religious victory is a little flat, but I havent tried to win that way.A lot of changes make this version of Civ feel a lot different: Districts being built on tiles to specialise them; Wonders containing their own tiles; great people being awarded differently. Civics work like the tech tree and are reaserched seperately but at the same time as tech. AI Diplomacy feels completely different with their agendas. Workers have charges and will be removed after they've been used which prevents getting to the late era with lots of workers stood doing nothing.All in all, the changes are generally good. I'm certainly enjoying a game that feels a lot more different than Civ 5 in its own way. I'm certainly enjoying it"

Workers no longer have infinite build points. but can only build 3 (Up to 5 with the Pyrimads and Serfdom) My one criticism is that the cultere system and government systed just doesn't fit. I liked it when you went down a tree as it made you develop your culture. Now you can get a cultural victory by just building resorts. Uranium is rarer, which I love, and the AI got a major improvement with agendas, now the AI will have certain agendas, and if you go against them they dislike you. When I put troops on a border and make demands, they treat it like an ultimatium, and usually comply (Unless I have 2 archer units on the border of a city with 50 defense in 2050). The AI is alot smarter, and declare joint wars on you more.Another criticism, is like in Civ 5, they add artificial difficulty, by giving the AI a bunch of advantages."

While the late game still feels weak and the lack of a build queue as well as after victory info slides makes the game feel inferior to Civilization V, there are some fantastic improvements. Each game definitely takes longer, but that is mostly due to the increased agency. Every game of Civ VI is different and unlike previous versions, you cannot simply lay back and let the game play itself. Some people might find that off putting, but the increased involvement means more than ever that every choice you make has meaning.

220,97.4,Not Recommended," October 25, 2016",1,"I really anticipated Civ VI since it's been announced. I have a long history of playing every Civ game in the franchise since the original.Unfortunately Civ VI at the moment is a big disappointment. The main points for me being:- AI. If Firaxis just left AI unchanged from CIV V that would have been an improvement even though it was already very weak. Now after they added new diplomatic mechanics (agendas, casus beli, etc.) and new approach to city planning, the AI is just painfully incapable of making sense. The shortcomings were already outlined by other reviewers in great detail and I fully agree with their points. Personally I was mostly anticipating CIV VI in hope of better AI, and it is a very bitter disappointment to see such poor outcome.- Problems with diplomacy is essentially a specific issue with AI, but I feel I should have a separate mention of it. In Civ V towards end-game all AI Civs were essentially hating each other without much reason. Now the devs decided to add actual artificial reasons added for them to hate each other even more fiercely than before - the Agendas. This feature just doesn't work at all. Who needs these far-fetched inflexible negative parameters (""I will hate you because..."") that make diplomacy even less feasible than in Civ V?- Plenty of bugs and poor optimization. Ok, the bugs hopefully will be fixed, but it's still very annoying to se them. Some examples include broken alliance mechanics (AI units remain in your territory after alliance expires without open borders being active), pop-up messages being impossible to read, units pathfinding is a mess, etc. optimization is another issue - I have a very capable PC (Skylake i7) and yet in a 2-person hotseat game the AI turns take VERY long to complete even in a very early ancient era game! Single player games were smoother, but not sufficiently so.- Interface had some improvements (generally cleaner), but a lot of important information is very hard to find. Some information the devs just didn't bother to include at all. When and where the border expansion will happen in the city? Who cares, right? Or what's the strength of religious spread of a city? I guess some throbbing bubble is supposed to be informative on that...- Cartoonish art style. It's not too much of a big deal as it's certainly not the most important aspect of the game. I was willing to accept it if there were notable gameplay improvements made. On the other hand, seeing how ridiculous the AI is, perhaps the childish art style helps to not take AI behavior seriously. Was that your plan all along, Firaxis?- While the districts is a good feature that finally introduces some variability into cities development, the wonders are now all but irrelevant. Taking up an entire tyle (and removing its yields) and costing huge amount of production, it's just not worth investing in the wonders at all. This certainly does not help the game being more exciting.There are positives too, but for me personally the negatives just outweigh everything else. And I don't carry much hope for improvement. First it was the terrible Beyond Earth and now over-hyped and under-developed Civ VI. Not a good trend."

62,229.8,Not Recommended," February 19, 2017",1,Such an unbalanced game with lazy AI coding for the higher levels. Pretty graphics but a poor attempt under the hood. 2/10 for the Civ series. Inconsistancies in game play where units appear out of no where or multiple units are produced in the same turn at the one enemy city.I fail to see how this game has ranked so highly with the critics. Guess they are worried about future magazine sales than providing a true and honest account of the game.
39,20.7,Not Recommended," June 30, 2017",1,"I was pretty excited for the game and to be fair it is a pretty bold step from Civ V. I personally don't mind the art direction and the new mechanics are pretty fun to explore. That being said, the UI alone is one of the most infuriating interfaces I've ever tried to use. Personally I like to use the edges of the screen to move the map and the way that this is set up in Civ VI has to be the worst navigation I've ever experienced. Parts of the edges of the screen don't respond to the mouse and the very top the interface actually isn't what moves the map up, but instead it is the top of the game window so ie. whenever you try to vew Great Prophet progress your start scrolling to the top of the map. It's ridiculous and I don't recommend this game just cause it's so irritating to use."
63,279.6,Recommended," November 28, 2016",1,"This game is a mixed bag for now and needs to be patched along with much needed dlc. It has the potential to be the best civ game I've ever played I think but needs work. First of all, I have not been able to finish my last three games because of glitches. Either my game crashes on the same turn or I cannot advance to the next turn. Needless to say this is very frustrating but I am hopeful upcoming patches will fix this. This version is not as deep or nuanced as Civ 5 was imo. But just as they did with Civ 5, they will most likely tweek things until they get it right. I just hope they get things fixed soon."

It's as good as Civ 5 even without the DLC. The district system and the wonders being built outside of the main city tile create interesting bits of strategy. There is also a religious victory now, making religion a more viable route to go down. Oh and I can't forget the music! It's brilliant, the way it evolves throughout the eras, it's Civ for crying out loud!Buy this game, and if you can afford it get the deluxe edition. Can't wait for the dlc!"

220,97.4,Not Recommended," October 25, 2016",1,"I really anticipated Civ VI since it's been announced. I have a long history of playing every Civ game in the franchise since the original.Unfortunately Civ VI at the moment is a big disappointment. The main points for me being:- AI. If Firaxis just left AI unchanged from CIV V that would have been an improvement even though it was already very weak. Now after they added new diplomatic mechanics (agendas, casus beli, etc.) and new approach to city planning, the AI is just painfully incapable of making sense. The shortcomings were already outlined by other reviewers in great detail and I fully agree with their points. Personally I was mostly anticipating CIV VI in hope of better AI, and it is a very bitter disappointment to see such poor outcome.- Problems with diplomacy is essentially a specific issue with AI, but I feel I should have a separate mention of it. In Civ V towards end-game all AI Civs were essentially hating each other without much reason. Now the devs decided to add actual artificial reasons added for them to hate each other even more fiercely than before - the Agendas. This feature just doesn't work at all. Who needs these far-fetched inflexible negative parameters (""I will hate you because..."") that make diplomacy even less feasible than in Civ V?- Plenty of bugs and poor optimization.

76,104.6,Not Recommended, February 17,1,"Been playing the Civ series since Civ 1. 3 & 4 didn't get much play, but 1, 2, & V got thousands of hours of my life. Which brings me to Civ VI. I held off until it went on sale so I got it and a couple of DLCs for $12.I'm at 100 hours of play time, I have a decent feel for the game, but there are still things to learn. One thing I'm waiting to learn is ""Does it get fun at some point?""The answer I've found is: ""Not really.""While there are some improvements for sure, there are also so many things that need fixed its not even funny.1. The AI is garbage. Its 2017, AAA games should not have AI this garbage.2. Non-sensical battles still occur: A crossbowman shouldn't be able to hurt a battleship. Ever.3. End game is a brutal, brutal slog. Pay attention to your victory conditions kids because if you don't start on them ASAP you'll be forced to click ""Next Turn"" again and again when its obvious you'll win.4. War is possibly the most tedious its ever been even with some improvements.5. You'll learn to really, really hate the ""diplomacy"" videos where you are getting denounced for no reason.6. The Ghandi thing is old tired and dead. Good lord, he's declaring war constantly come on!7, Feels like it could've used more development time to balance better.There are some nice improvements, but overall, I can't imagine how I'd feel if I'd dropped full price on the game.For $12 I don't feel like it was a bad deal, but since the game isn't usually that cheap, I can't really recommend it at this point. It needs a lot of polish to remove the grind from it and I doubt that's going to happen."

432,40.8,Recommended," March 20, 2017",1,"I'm really torn on this one. If Steam had a ""ehhh"" button in between Yes and No then this is one of the times that I would press it. For everything that Civ VI does better than Civ V it does something worse.First off the art style. This is one of the areas that I personally find to be much better than Civ V. The change is very subjective however and you might no like the stylized nature but I find it more aesthetically pleasing than Civ V. The more ""cartoony"" fits much better with the giant people running around the map than the realistic looking units IMO.While the art is nice the AI is wonky. It's not bad, but it could be much better. Compared to Civ V the AI are far more aggressive and I find this to be a welcome change. Far to often the AI in Civ V would never declare war with me. I have won multiple games playing as an isolationist working towards a science victory. In Civ VI however I have been attacked multiple times while attempting this strategy, which is nice and adds a good challenge. While the extra aggression is nice, the AI can be extremely bipolar. One turn a leader will praise me for being a strong and tough nation, and then denounce me on the next. And while the AI are more aggressive, they are aggressive for the wrong reasons. I've had war declared on me because I had a weak navy, a small amount of gold, or because my military was too large.Lastly, the districts system is a nice change from Civ V where most of my games devolved into a mindless spam of improving every owned tile, and building every building. Having to choose between a farm and a shiny new airport is nice, and keeps the game engaging.Overall Civ VI feels almost like a lateral move. The new game play additions are very welcome and really help spice up the formula. But the unpredictability of the AI really drag the whole package down. If you are still playing and loving Civ V, I would say to wait for an expansion before picking this one up. If you are looking for something new and Civ V has gone stale, then I would recommend this one.It builds and improves on Civ V in terms of game play mechanics, but most of the time I think that the AI subsists on a diet of paste and paint chips. A step up in some regards, and a step back in others."

The art style in this is hard for some to get used to, but I think it adds character and its similar to the older games. It really makes it look great and unique compared to some other games, in my opinion.So far, its a lot more fun to begin with than civ V was, thats without owning much DLC as well.The AI's random interests make it fun as well. You never know who is going to be a pain in your♥♥♥♥♥ but hey! For some reason, Norway likes me. Heck knows why yet. It's all random and a mysteryyyy!Also the barbarians so far aren't as big of a pain as they were in civ V.

125,17.8,Not Recommended, January 20,1,"The AI in this game needs some serious work. Honestly, the ""agenda"" system doesn't make for a fun experience, because it seems like that's all the AI are influenced by. These statistics are generated at the beginning of the game and determine whether or not the civ will like you or hate you based on actions such as religious expansion, military size, and other things that just happen through you playing the game. It makes the AI characters feel incredibly uninteresting and predictable, as they are only influenced by those two statistics that they recieve from the start. It really ruins the game for me, because most of my fun times in Civilization V were had through interesting diplomatic interactions.I would definitely recommend the Civilization V with all the expansions over this game."

Sometimes UI glitch (I have ""new regime available"" instead of ""next turn"" - works as shoud, an animation bug).- Eats a lot of RAM and does not want to exit without killing the process.- Units sometimes got lost in the middle of a route. I don't like the way the planned routes are displayed.- This annoying limitation on ""how many units of the same type on one cell""."

All I can say is that this is the first time I have felt like the game has taken a step backwards. I'm not a fan of districts or of the smaller cities that require large empires. I can live with the art style but the game itself seems busy with so many things just in to be in (why the religious fighting?). Get it on sale but otherwise stick to Civ V."
82,10.0,Recommended, January 16,1,"The art direction is a bit lackluster, but the more you play, the more you can bear it, and maybe even appreciate it. Gameplay is top notch and arguably an improvement from Civ V. $12 was too good of a deal to pass up, and Im glad I didn't. Controversial art direction, great gameplay."
441,496.2,Recommended," November 15, 2017",1,"Pros:Graphics:The graphics look good, not a huge improvement over Civ 5 but they do look nice.CivilizationsThe Civilizations are well planned, although some feel way more powerful than others like the Germans and the Australians.Technology, Culture & GovernmentThe new boost system for technologies and civics is really cool and being able to switch between civics instead of having a set group of bonuses is awesome.The different types of governments are unique and give powerful bonuses to whatever goal you have for the game.Except for the mainstays like England, Rome, Germany and Russia, the DLC civilizations seem to be chosen at random. It's not really important though since you can use Mods to get around this, as long as you can slog through the billions of anime related civs.When you select a site to build a district at, there is no cancel button or even a relocate button. This is ridiculous and should be changed as soon as possible. In multiplayer games, if you accidentally select the wrong spot the only way to solve the problem is to restart the entire game or just accept that you f'd up and play with a handicap for the rest of the game. If this seems like a balance issue, you can always add penalties to relocating them, (i.e. it takes half the production spent to relocate it to the new spot.)The A.I. needs a improvement. Currently, a ""higher difficulty"" consists of giving the AI a bigger boost to their base production, science, etc. instead of a computer player that actually fights wars better or builds stronger cities. When the AI builds a city, they give almost no consideration as to how productive or successful they will be. They almost always build them right on the closest acceptable tile to their starting city.When I play Civ VI, a lot of the maps have a similar feel to them and I don't get very many unique feeling games overall.The AI seems predisposed to causing total war on any human controlled civilization that does not immediately send a delegation to them, the AI does this regardless of their relative technology level and likelihood of success.The AI blames civilizations that get attacked, giving warmongering penalties even when they are defending themselves against a surprise or formal war declaration.The Diplomacy screen for each civilization is well done, but could use way more information such as the length of time you have been at peace, if you have been denounced, what turn it happened and when the denouncement will run out and what city states they are at war with.Finding out what resources you are currently trading is a chore, if you look at the way it was done in Civ 4 it is incredibly easy to see the things you are trading but in this one you have to scroll through each resource in a huge list to see if you are already trading it to someone.I'd rate this as maybe the second best Civ in the series, only because the AI sucks so badly - hopefully they will work on it for a while instead of releasing DLCs and scenarios."
530,207.6,Not Recommended, January 20,1,"""Mixed bag"" is the only way to describe Civ VI.If you're new to the 4X genre, the game is user friendly enough that you could be a competent player after around 30 hours. However, Civ V offers that same accessibility, and given how frequently the game and all its dlc goes on sale, you'd likely be better off starting there. You'd be getting hundreds of hours of content and a far more fleshed out entry in the series to sink yourself into. You'll have a better appreciation of the changes that came with this game, and you'll have a far better understanding of many of the flaws I mention below.For the players like myself who put hundreds of hours into Civ V, the game offers a treasure trove of new features as well as updates to old systems. The most important addition is the district system which makes your city's tiles feel valuable now. This allows you to specialize your cities to a far greater degree than you ever could in Civ V, and forces you to put care into city placement as well as how your workers shape its land. Its one of the nice things I've seen put in a 4X that helps break up the early to mid-game slog. Overall, the first 60 hours I played when it first released felt wonderful, and if the game remained that way I could happily recommend this as a good sequel to Civ V. The problem is that it didn't.Passed that point, it became increasingly evident how broken certain aspects of the game are and how little care went into making the game good. The AI is disgusting in how stupid they are, even for a Civ game. The new agenda system gives each Civ certain priorities that affect their opinion of other civs. This is interesting on paper, but works like♥♥♥♥♥♥in practice. Civs will almost always find something to be angry at you for, and the most egregious case is when a leader favors a civ set up for domination victory (strong military, surprise war declarations, etc) but also ♥♥♥♥ing hates them for warmongering, a penalty that is never forgotten in your 6000 years as a civilization. ""Just avoid war"" you might say, and that would be easy if every game there wasn't at least 2-3 AI that introduce themselves, offer you trade deals, and then declare war on you a turn later. These wars consist of them never actually sending any troops, plundering your trade routes, and then asking for peace 10 turns later. The game feels like it's forcing a gun to your head so you go for a domination victory. This isn't helped when the developers insist on releasing overpriced dlc civs that are horribly imbalanced and almost all favor war; Macedon in particular is loving it so much that he may as well be considered p2w given how hard he can steamroll the game.Other minor issues: (1) The game wasting Sean Bean on a collection of quotes that are about 45% made up or falsely attributed♥♥♥♥♥♥the devs pulled from blogs. (2) Civ imbalance in general. Civs like France are laughably weak while things like Scythia get to♥♥♥♥♥♥out horse archers that later can be helicopters. (3) Some of the leaders themselves are either ridiculous choices like Catherine de Medici for France or poor representations of the historical figure like Qin shi Huang. (4) The lack of mechanical diversty in the civs themselves. The majority of them are a give some decent war capability and then a bonus to faith, trade, culture, etc. Each new game feels bland when few civs have mechanics that make them stand out.All of this combined makes the game incredibly hard to recommend, and unless you can grab it on sale I'd wait for the game to improve with future expansions. It's not like the game is unplayable or even bad; it makes enough changes to the Civ formula that that you'll manage at least 100 hours of fun. The issue is that for a 4X, you'd have to release a trashfire of a game to not manage that. This isn't someone's first attempt at a 4X, it's Firaxis. For a studio with so much experience, the product feels surprisingly amateur."

45,99.8,Recommended," October 21, 2016",1,"I pre-ordered and couldn't wait for it to release-and I'm totally satisfied. If you're a Civ fan, then all of the mechanics are still in place with some good additions. After being disappointed with 'Beyond Earth' I was glad to see the dev didn't keep the clumsy and IMO boring and pace killing diplomacy point system.I'm taking a break from a 5 hour session-which shows Civ6 has kept that addictive, 'one more turn' magic in place. New features include a builder unit instead of worker, which gets used up after 3 turns. The civic and religious tweaks are still in place, with multiple military, economic and diplomatic perks you can unlock as you discover techs.All in all they've kept everything that was great about Civ5 in place and tweaked it for the better. The graphics are definitely Civ style, and the narration and music produce a very atmospheric experience. I'm going to be a total recluse for many months ahead, and this release and Farm Simulator 2017 are being released 5 days apart. Onwards and enjoy my fellow Civ-fanatics!!!"
168,7.6,Recommended," October 25, 2016",1,"Such a fun and amazing game after CIV V to be fair it does take a little while to get used to with playing CIV V a lot but all in all this is a game worth buying, to all the people moaning on how the AI declares war or isn't always happy with you, just simply keeps a tab on all the things e.g. troops, resources, agenders and make sure not to do something that will p*ss them off, when you click on them it even tells you what will p*ss them off and make them friendlier. But this is just my review and you yourself can judge the game, despite what other reviews say, i didn't take any advice from them and i just went out a bought the game as i was intended to regardless. The game is not the same as CIV V with the builders not been permanent and various other changes but, who wants another CIV V anyway we needed change and CIV VI provided.In conclusion, i personally would recommend this game but it's completely up to you to buy the game."

90,171.0,Recommended," October 25, 2016",1,"I had removed CIV5 from my ""playlist"" in favour of Paradox' titles, as they just felt more engaging after thousands of hours of CIV over the years, but I was of course still excited to try out CIV6. So far, some 40-50 hours in (EDIT: Apparently I'm just over 100 hours in, how the time flies), I've not been disappointed!My major takeaways, positive and negative, so far:1. I am no longer punished for building wide - wow what a feeling!2. The music is great, and it's dynamic aspects works perfectly almost making me feel like part of an epic movie.3. I like the new tech boost system, but it's still too early to tell if it's actually good for the game or not. If an optimal strategy can be found the new system might be more limiting than it is rewarding.4. However, the civets/policy system I feel adds a great deal and is a step forward.5. I like the attention made to the diplomacy system in general, but it still needs a lot of polish and tweaks. It can get quite annoying that you can never be friends with the AI unless you give them incredible bribes and also toe the line of their diplomatic agendas perfectly.6. I encountered quite a few bugs with the UI. However, no performance problem on my 2 year old machine (GPU is a GTX760).Overall I will have a lot of fun with this. Better than CIV5? Sure, why not - but I don't know if it will last as long as CIV5 did in it's present state, but I'm hopeful future updates will make it so. My favourite CIV is still CIV4 though :)"

2,22.7,Not Recommended, January 9,1,"I've always loved the entire Civilization franchise so it pains me that software performance prevents me from playing this. In my brief experience the game suffered random freezing and will not give up focus to other applications (including task manager) most notably on exit where it wasn't noticed as i left the computer and the ""gameplay"" clock kept running so Steam won't issue a refund. Every attempt to exit the game has caused it to freeze the UI at full screen and not allow any other access until a manual power off and reboot of the system. Even if i had to manually force close teh game it would be manageble if i actually could but the lockout on focus is just shoddy code from a company that doesn;t respond to support inquiries and operates on the philosophy of ""we have your money so we don;t care"" definitely teh last steam game I ever buy."
636,348.8,Recommended," November 23, 2016",1,"Sometimes a sequel launches so poorly that it takes three years to reach the same level of polish as its predecessor. Sometimes the designer of a Civ title is so grossly incompetant that the game suffers from their bad designs for its entire life cycle. And sometimes, we forget just how difficult building a Civ game engine from scratch must be.CIvilization VI is not one of these games, and it's designer is not one of those designers. The game suffers from several defects related to being built on a customized in-house engine. The game lacks polish in several areas. The user interface lacks critical information about how certain mechanics work. The game needs changes, of course.But it is entirely worth every penny spent on this game. Even with all the problems it has, it's still very enjoyable. It makes previous Vanilla Civ releases feel subpar, especially the mess that was Civ 5 at launch. The multiplayer works better at launch than Civ 5's did after its final patch.Personally, I expected the issues we have with this game. It's brand new, and we're comparing it to Civ 5 with 2 expansions and 15+ patches. In a few years, this game will be leaps and bounds ahead of where it is now, and I'm excited to see what comes next!"
121,17.8,Recommended," October 23, 2016",1,"I'm biased... This was the first series of games I played at the age of 7, because I found it on my mom's laptop while she was at work and just always played it. I've grown up playing games, every genre really. This has become my all-time favorite game, period. I'm not sure theres another game that's captivated my interest for 14 hours straight, into the night, then again the very next day right after I woke up and ate. Fallout has gotten close, but at that point I was just mindlessly droning. I always felt like, and feel like, I'm accomplishing something in Civ 6. The greatest part is, Civ always has new expansions that manage to add more to an already vast game, although my expectations were exceeded, it's odd to say I expect my expectations to continue to be exceeded.TLDR; Buy this game. It's worth it."

445,15.1,Recommended," October 23, 2016",1,"I have some good things and some bad things to say about this new civ game. First of all, the positives:- It's finally a MODERN civ game with no graphic glitches on modern win 10 systems and it runs natively in 64 bits. Everything runs extremely well at max settings (4K res, all grfx settings at max.)- I LOVE the districts and that you can make every city different and unique. I also love that you control population directly, by building neighborhoods.- I love the new animations for movement and combat.- I love that the game is still extremely customizable just like civ 5. I like that I can start in any era and that I can customize the map and the game as much as I want. Unfortunately, playing on planet Earth seems to be missing, and that's the map I always use with civ 5.- I love the improved diplomacy and the new spy management section.Now for what I don't like:- Buildings and military units are MUCH HARDER to obtain. You have to play for at least 5-6 hours before you can even start considering attacking another nation. And even with resources set at max, strategic resources are MUCH HARDER to come by. Which means you'll be a lot less inclined to risk units on daring tactics, because rebuilding them would be prohibitive.- The AI is insane. Computer-controlled nations declare war on me all the time, for no reason (really? Rome is angry at me for building 30 hexes away from their closest city?) I found myself at war with 5-6 nations, none of them allied. That makes absolutely NO SENSE.- What's with the random comments on my civ from other nations? The same useless comments that repeat over and over and that don't lead to anything other than a ""goodbye"" button. Talk about a gratuitous waste of my time!- Why oh why are workers expended after they only built three things? And why have they become a lot harder to get? In civ 5 I'm used to hundreds of workers building and fixing things. Now even workers have become a luxury? It takes at least 10 hours before your biggest city with all the fixings can produce a worker unit every turn.- I don't particularly like the more cartoonish diplomacy animationd. I want to deal with people, not cartoons. It's pretty hard for me to take them seriously when they look like Manga characters...I don't know if I can recommend it. Unfortunately there is no neutral option, so it's either yes or no. Hopefully new versions will take care of the shortcomings and that's why I decided to recommend it. But not if you buy it right now (as in 10/23/2016.)FOR NOW IT'S **NOT** RECOMMENDED."
448,148.5,Recommended," October 23, 2016",1,Nice and fresh take on Civ. Really enjoy the fact that you have to plan out your cities more than in previous Civs where you just spam every tile with farms and mines around cities that have 15 wonders built in them because that's where all your production is.

Not really recommend for player who really love civ 5, no changing city name, can't stop increase population of city the best you can is make them have no growth, no mods, no additional maps, too little option for creating your own game. Sometimes AI really make no sense just like when allied end and relationship is very friendly they just declare war out of nowhere. Overall the game is very bold in takeing the next step especially the diplomatic which kinda very deep that make civ 5 diplomatic looks like child play. And graphic is really good still wonder when they will release DX12 version as they state before. Just a bit lag when I tried to exit the game really need to use task manager everytime. LOL"
53,36.9,Recommended," October 23, 2016",1,"Visually pleasing compared to Civ 5 as well as a lot more to do. This can be overwhelming and frustrating, though, but it is a plus once you get the hang of the districts and tile placements. I also enjoy the commentary on the wonders and watching them be built.There are many positive things on this game that beat Civ 5 and the only a few negatives. I would say that barbarians can be pretty harsh in this one, but you can work around that. There is also not an initial ally button to become allies with friends, so that is a turn off as well. The rest of the negatives just have to do with needing more civs to play as and more maps, but that will come with mods and expainsions."
